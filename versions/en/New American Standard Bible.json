      "13": "If it pleases my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to me and more so, if I fail to inform you and send you away, so that you may go in safety. And may the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.",

      "28": "And Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly requested leave of me to go to Bethlehem.",
      "29": "He said, ‘Please let me go, because our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has ordered me to attend. So now, if I have found favor in your sight, please let me slip away so that I may see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table.”",
      "30": "Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?",
      "31": "For, as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now then, send men and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die!”",
      "32": "But Jonathan replied to his father Saul and said to him, “Why must he be put to death? What has he done?”",
      "33": "Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike and kill him; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death.",
      "34": "Then Jonathan got up from the table in the heat of anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, because he was worried about David since his father had insulted him.",
      "35": "Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out to the field at the time agreed upon with David, and a little boy was with him.",
      "36": "He said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot.” The boy ran, and he shot an arrow past him.",
      "37": "When the boy reached the location of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, “Is the arrow not beyond you?”",
      "38": "Then Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry, be quick, do not stay!” And Jonathan’s boy picked up the arrow and came to his master.",
      "39": "But the boy was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter.",
      "40": "Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go, bring them to the city.”",
      "41": "When the boy was gone, David got up from the south side, then he fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, until David wept immeasurably.",
      "42": "Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in safety, since we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’” So David set out and went on his way, while Jonathan went into the city."

      "29": "Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent word again a second time, but he would not come.",
      "30": "Therefore he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s plot is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the plot on fire.",

      "3": "Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but you have no one to listen to you on the part of the king.”",

      "33": "And David said to him, “If you go over with me, then you will become a burden to me.",
      "34": "But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; even as I was your father’s servant in time past, so now I will also be your servant,’ then you can foil the advice of Ahithophel for me.",
      "35": "Are Zadok and Abiathar the priests not with you there? So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",

      "8": "Therefore the wrath of the LORD was against Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, of horror, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes."
