      "13": "If it pleases my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to me and more so, if I fail to inform you and send you away, so that you may go in safety. And may the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.",

      "28": "And Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly requested leave of me to go to Bethlehem.",
      "29": "He said, ‘Please let me go, because our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has ordered me to attend. So now, if I have found favor in your sight, please let me slip away so that I may see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table.”",
      "30": "Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?",
      "31": "For, as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now then, send men and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die!”",
      "32": "But Jonathan replied to his father Saul and said to him, “Why must he be put to death? What has he done?”",
      "33": "Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike and kill him; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death.",
      "34": "Then Jonathan got up from the table in the heat of anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, because he was worried about David since his father had insulted him.",

      "36": "He said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot.” The boy ran, and he shot an arrow past him.",
      "37": "When the boy reached the location of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, “Is the arrow not beyond you?”",
      "38": "Then Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry, be quick, do not stay!” And Jonathan’s boy picked up the arrow and came to his master.",
      "39": "But the boy was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter.",
      "40": "Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go, bring them to the city.”",
      "41": "When the boy was gone, David got up from the south side, then he fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, until David wept immeasurably.",
      "42": "Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in safety, since we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’” So David set out and went on his way, while Jonathan went into the city."

      "29": "Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent word again a second time, but he would not come.",
      "30": "Therefore he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s plot is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the plot on fire.",

      "3": "Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but you have no one to listen to you on the part of the king.”",

      "33": "And David said to him, “If you go over with me, then you will become a burden to me.",
      "34": "But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; even as I was your father’s servant in time past, so now I will also be your servant,’ then you can foil the advice of Ahithophel for me.",
      "35": "Are Zadok and Abiathar the priests not with you there? So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",

      "21": "Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” And David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.”",
      "22": "Araunah then said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what is good in his sight. Look, here are the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.",
      "23": "Everything, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the LORD your God be favorable to you.”",
      "24": "However, the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will certainly buy it from you for a price; for I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.",
      "25": "Then David built there an altar to the LORD, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the LORD responded to prayer for the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel."

      "1": "Now King David was old, advanced in age; and they covered him with garments, but he could not keep warm.",
      "2": "So his servants said to him, “Have them search for a young virgin for my lord the king, and have her attend the king and become his nurse; and have her lie on your chest, so that my lord the king may keep warm.”",
      "3": "So they searched for a beautiful girl throughout the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.",
      "4": "The girl was very beautiful; and she became the king’s nurse and served him, but the king did not become intimate with her.",
      "5": "Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” So he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, with fifty men to run before him.",
      "6": "And his father had never rebuked him at any time by asking, “Why have you done so?” And he was also a very handsome man, and he was born after Absalom.",
      "7": "Now he had conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest; and they allied themselves with Adonijah.",
      "8": "But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.",
      "9": "Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened steers by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants.",
      "10": "But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon.",
      "11": "Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it?",
      "12": "So now come, please let me give you advice, and save your life and the life of your son Solomon.",
      "13": "Go at once to King David and say to him, ‘Have you not, my lord the king, sworn to your servant, saying, “Solomon your son certainly shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’",
      "14": "Behold, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”",
      "15": "So Bathsheba entered to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.",
      "16": "Then Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself before the king. And the king said, “What is on your mind?”",
      "17": "So she said to him, “My lord, you yourself swore to your servant by the LORD your God, saying, ‘Your son Solomon certainly shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’",
      "18": "But now, behold, Adonijah is king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know it.",
      "19": "He has sacrificed oxen and fattened steers and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant.",
      "20": "And as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to announce to them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.",
      "21": "Otherwise it will come about, as soon as my lord the king lies down with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders.”",
      "22": "And behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.",
      "23": "They informed the king, saying, “Nathan the prophet is here.” And when he came into the king’s presence, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground.",
      "24": "Then Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you yourself said, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne’?",
      "25": "For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fattened steers and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest, and behold, they are eating and drinking in his presence; and they say, ‘ Long live King Adonijah!’",
      "26": "But me, even me your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, he has not invited.",
      "27": "Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not let your servants know who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”",
      "28": "Then King David responded and said, “Summon Bathsheba to me.” And she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king.",
      "29": "Then the king vowed and said, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,",
      "30": "certainly as I vowed to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Your son Solomon certainly shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place’; I will indeed do so this day.”",
      "31": "Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and prostrated herself before the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever.”",
      "32": "Then King David said, “Summon to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” And they came into the king’s presence."
