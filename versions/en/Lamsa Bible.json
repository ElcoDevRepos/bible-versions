      "15": "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your posterity and her posterity; her posterity shall tread your head under foot, and you shall strike him in his heel.",
      "16": "To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pain and your conception; in pain you shall bring forth children, and you shall be dependent on your husband, and he shall rule over you.",
      "17": "And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it, cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat the fruits of it all the days of your life;",
      "18": "Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field;",
      "19": "In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, until you return to the ground; out of it you were taken; for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.",

      "24": "And the children of Israel drew near to battle against the Benjamites on the second day.",
      "25": "And the Benjamites went out against them from Gibeah the second day, and left dead on the ground eighteen thousand men of the children of Israel; all of these men who drew the sword.",
      "26": "Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up and came to Beth-el, and wept and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.",

      "35": "And the LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty-five thousand, one hundred men; all of those who drew the sword.",
      "36": "So the Benjamites saw that they were defeated; and the children of Israel gave ground to the Benjamites, because they trusted in the ambushes that they had set against Gibeah.",
      "37": "And the men who were in ambush quietly made an attack against Gibeah; then the men in ambush moved forward and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.",
      "38": "Now there was an appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush, which was that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.",

      "41": "And when the men of Israel turned against them, the Benjamites were terrified; for they saw that disaster was upon them.",
      "42": "Therefore they fled before the men of Israel on their way to the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and those who came out of the city first were trapped in the midst of them.",
      "43": "Thus they pursued the Benjamites and drove them away, and smote them with ease, to the east beyond Gibeah.",
      "44": "And there fell of the Benjamites eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.",
      "45": "And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and five thousand of them fell in the highway; all men that drew the sword; and they pursued hard after them as far as Gibeon, and slew two thousand men of them.",

      "3": "And the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the asses. And Saul arose and went, and took one of the servants with him, and they went to seek the asses of his father.",
      "4": "And they passed through mount Ephraim and through the land of Gomrey, but they did not find them; then they passed through the land of Taley, and they were not there; and they passed through the land of Benjamin, but they did not find them.",
      "5": "And when they came to the land of Sur, Saul said to the servant who was with him, Come, let us return, lest my father cease to be anxious about the asses and begin to be concerned about us.",
      "6": "But his servant said to him, Behold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is an honorable man in the eyes of the people; all that he says comes surely to pass; now let us go there; perhaps he can tell us about the errand for which we have come.",
      "7": "Then Saul said to his servant, Behold, if we go, what shall we bring to the man of God? For the bread is spent in our bags and there are no provisions to bring a present to the man of God, because we have nothing.",
      "8": "And the servant answered his master again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver; let us give it to the man of God, that he may tell us about our errand.",
      "9": "(Because formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a prophet, before was called a seer.)",

      "13": "As soon as you enter the city, you shall straightway find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifices; and afterwards those who are invited, eat. Now therefore go up; for today you shall find him.",

      "19": "And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place; for you shall eat with me today, and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.",
      "20": "And as for your asses that were lost three days ago, do not be anxious about them, for they have been found. And on whom is all the hope of the house of Israel? Is it not on you and on your father's house?",
      "21": "And Saul answered and said to Samuel, Behold, I am a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family is the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin. Why then have you spoken thus to me?",
      "22": "And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the house, and gave them a place at the head of those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.",
      "23": "And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it apart.",
      "24": "And the cook took up the shoulder and the thigh, and set them before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! Set it before you and eat; because it has been kept for you for some time. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.",
      "25": "And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel conversed with Saul upon the roof.",
      "26": "And they arose at dawn, and Samuel called to Saul upon the roof, saying, Up, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel.",

      "12": "And a man of the same place answered and said, But who is his father? Therefore it became a byword, Is Saul also among the prophets?",
      "13": "And when he had finished prophesying, he left the high place, and came home.",

      "31": "Then Joab arose and came to Absalom's house and said to Absalom, Why have your servants set my field on fire?",
      "32": "And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask why I have come from Geshur. It was better for me while I was there; now I want to appear before the king and if there is any iniquity in me, let him kill me.",
      "33": "So Joab came to the king and told him the words of Absalom; and he called for Absalom, and Absalom came in before the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom."

      "3": "And Absalom said to him, I see your arguments are good and just; but there is no man deputed by the king to hear you.",
      "4": "Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made a judge in the land, that every man who has a lawsuit or a cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!",
      "5": "And whenever a man arose to do him obeisance, he held him by his hand and kissed him.",

      "7": "And it came to pass after four years Absalom said to the king, Let me go and fulfil my vow which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron;",
      "8": "For your servant made a vow while I abode at Geshur and in Aram, saying. If the LORD will bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.",

      "11": "And with Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem, but they went innocently, not knowing anything of the plot.",
      "12": "And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, and brought him from his city, from Giloh, while he was offering sacrifices. And the conspiracy grew strong; and the people increased continually on the side of Absalom.",
      "13": "And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.",
      "14": "And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom; make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword.",
      "15": "And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king wants to do.",

      "26": "But if he shall say, I have no delight in you; behold, here I am, let him do to me as seems good in his sight.",
      "27": "The king said also to Zadok the priest, Return, go to the city in peace, you and your sons with you, Ahimaaz your son and Nathan the son of Abiathar.",
      "28": "See, I will wait in the plain of the wilderness until there come a man from you to inform me.",
      "29": "Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem; and they remained there.",

      "2": "And the king said to Ziba, Where did you get these? Ziba said to him, The asses are to carry the burden of the king's household; and the bread and fig cakes are for the young men to eat, and the wine, that those who faint in the wilderness may drink.",
      "3": "And the king said to him, Where is your master's son? Ziba said to him, Behold he remains at Jerusalem; for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of Saul my father.",

      "11": "And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, Behold, my own son, who came forth from my loins, seeks my life; so now let this Benjamite alone, let him curse; for God has bidden him.",
      "12": "It may be the LORD will look on my affliction and requite me good for his cursing this day.",

      "12": "And the man said to Joab, Though you should count to me a thousand shekels of silver, I would not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Be careful not to harm the young man Absalom for my sake.",
      "13": "And if I should have done it, then I would have been guilty; and nothing would have been hidden from the king, and you yourself would have stood against me.",

      "6": "The lowest chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for outside in the wall of the house he made narrowed copings round about in order that the walls should be fastened together.",

And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way and slew him; and his corpse was cast in the way, and the ass stood beside, and the lion also stood by the corpse.",

It is the prophet of God who disobeyed the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke to him.",

And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass, and they saddled it.",

So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing to the calves that he had made; and he appointed in Beth-el priests for the temples of idols which he had made. For the saying which he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Beth-el and against all the temples of idols which are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass.",
      "33": "And he went to the altar which he had made in Beth-el, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and made a feast to the children of Israel; and he went up to the altar to burn incense. After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made again from among the people priests for the temples of idols; whosoever would become a priest, he offered an offering and thus became the priest of the temple of idols."

      "40": "And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; for just as iron hammers and breaks everything in pieces, so shall it break and conquer every kingdom.",
      "41": "And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potter's clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it some of the strength of iron, just as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.",
      "42": "And as for the toes of the feet which you saw, part of iron and part of clay, so some parts of the kingdom shall be strong and some parts weak.",
      "43": "And whereas you saw iron mixed with miry clay, so they shall mix themselves with one another in marriage; but they shall not cleave one to another, just as iron does not mix with clay.",
      "44": "And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up an everlasting kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and bring to an end all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.",
      "45": "Forasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to you what shall come to pass in the latter days. The dream is true, and its interpretation is sure.",
      "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer incense and sacrifices to him.",
      "47": "The king answered Daniel and said, Truly, your God is the God of gods and the LORD of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery.",
      "48": "Then the king advanced Daniel's rank and gave him a great many gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and appointed him chief over all the generals of the armies and over all the wise men of Babylon.",
