      "15": "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your posterity and her posterity; her posterity shall tread your head under foot, and you shall strike him in his heel.",
      "16": "To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pain and your conception; in pain you shall bring forth children, and you shall be dependent on your husband, and he shall rule over you.",
      "17": "And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it, cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat the fruits of it all the days of your life;",
      "18": "Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field;",
      "19": "In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, until you return to the ground; out of it you were taken; for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.",

      "21": "Now therefore do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.",
