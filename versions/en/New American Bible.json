      "4": "the poor-looking, gaunt cows devoured the seven fine-looking, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.",

      "6": "Behind them sprouted seven ears of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind;",

      "8": "Next morning his mind was agitated. So Pharaoh had all the magicians and sages of Egypt summoned and recounted his dream to them; but there was no one to interpret it for him.",
      "9": "Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh: “Now I remember my negligence!",
      "10": "Once, when Pharaoh was angry with his servants, he put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the chief steward.",

      "20": "The gaunt, bad cows devoured the first seven fat cows.",
      "21": "But when they had consumed them, no one could tell that they had done so, because they looked as bad as before. Then I woke up.",

      "31": "no trace of the abundance will be found in the land because of the famine that follows it, for it will be very severe.",

      "35": "They should collect all the food of these coming good years, gathering the grain under Pharaoh’s authority, for food in the cities, and they should guard it.",
      "36": "This food will serve as a reserve for the country against the seven years of famine that will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish in the famine.”",

      "48": "he collected all the food of these years of plenty that the land of Egypt was enjoying and stored it in the cities, placing in each city the crops of the fields around it.",
      "49": "Joseph collected grain like the sands of the sea, so much that at last he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.",
      "50": "Before the famine years set in, Joseph became the father of two sons, borne to him by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis.",
      "51": "Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh, meaning, “God has made me forget entirely my troubles and my father’s house”;",

      "53": "When the seven years of abundance enjoyed by the land of Egypt came to an end,",

      "56": "When the famine had spread throughout the land, Joseph opened all the cities that had grain and rationed it to the Egyptians, since the famine had gripped the land of Egypt.",
