      "4": "the poor-looking, gaunt cows devoured the seven fine-looking, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.",

      "6": "Behind them sprouted seven ears of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind;",

      "31": "no trace of the abundance will be found in the land because of the famine that follows it, for it will be very severe.",

      "35": "They should collect all the food of these coming good years, gathering the grain under Pharaoh’s authority, for food in the cities, and they should guard it.",

      "48": "he collected all the food of these years of plenty that the land of Egypt was enjoying and stored it in the cities, placing in each city the crops of the fields around it.",
      "49": "Joseph collected grain like the sands of the sea, so much that at last he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.",
      "50": "Before the famine years set in, Joseph became the father of two sons, borne to him by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis.",
      "51": "Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh, meaning, “God has made me forget entirely my troubles and my father’s house”;",

      "53": "When the seven years of abundance enjoyed by the land of Egypt came to an end,",

      "56": "When the famine had spread throughout the land, Joseph opened all the cities that had grain and rationed it to the Egyptians, since the famine had gripped the land of Egypt.",

      "4": "So Samson went and caught three hundred jackals, and turning them tail to tail, he took some torches and tied one between each pair of tails.",
      "5": "He then kindled the torches and set the jackals loose in the standing grain of the Philistines, thus burning both the shocks and standing grain, the vineyards and olive groves.",
      "6": "When the Philistines asked, “Who has done this?” they were told, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because his wife was taken and given to his best man.” So the Philistines went up and destroyed her and her family by fire.",
      "7": "Samson said to them, “If this is how you act, I will not stop until I have taken revenge on you.”",

      "11": "Three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the crag of Etam and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines are our rulers? Why, then, have you done this to us?” He answered them, “As they have done to me, so have I done to them.”",
      "12": "They said to him, “We have come down to bind you and deliver you to the Philistines.” Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.”",
      "13": "“No,” they replied, “we will only bind you and hand you over to them. We will certainly not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the crag.",

      "16": "Then Samson said, “With the jawbone of an ass I have piled them in a heap; With the jawbone of an ass I have slain a thousand men.”",
      "17": "As he finished speaking he threw the jawbone from him; and so that place was named Ramath-lehi.",

      "11": "“If they bind me tight with new ropes, with which no work has been done,” he answered her, “I shall grow weaker and be like anyone else.”",
      "12": "So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them. Then she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” For there were men lying in wait in the room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like thread.",

      "14": "So when he went to bed, Delilah took the seven locks of his hair and wove them into the web, and fastened them with the pin. Then she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” Awakening from his sleep, he pulled out both the loom and the web.",

      "16": "She pressed him continually and pestered him till he was deathly weary of it.",
      "17": "So he told her all that was in his heart and said, “No razor has touched my head, for I have been a nazirite for God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, my strength will leave me, and I shall grow weaker and be like anyone else.”",
      "18": "When Delilah realized that he had told her all that was in his heart, she summoned the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up this time, for he has told me all that is in his heart.” So the lords of the Philistines came to her and brought the money with them.",
      "19": "She put him to sleep on her lap, and called for a man who shaved off the seven locks of his hair. He immediately became helpless, for his strength had left him.",
      "20": "When she said “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” he woke from his sleep and thought, “I will go out as I have done time and again and shake myself free.” He did not realize that the LORD had left him.",
      "21": "But the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. Then they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze fetters, and he was put to grinding grain in the prison.",
      "22": "But the hair of his head began to grow as soon as it was shaved.",

      "25": "When their spirits were high, they said, “Call Samson that he may amuse us.” So they called Samson from the prison, and he provided amusement for them. They made him stand between the columns,",

      "46": "Today the LORD shall deliver you into my hand; I will strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will feed your dead body and the dead bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field; thus the whole land shall learn that Israel has a God.",

      "51": "Then David ran and stood over him; with the Philistine’s own sword which he drew from its sheath he killed him, and cut off his head. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they fled.",
      "52": "Then the men of Israel and Judah sprang up with a battle cry and pursued them to the approaches of Gath and to the gates of Ekron, and Philistines fell wounded along the road from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron.",
      "53": "When they returned from their pursuit of the Philistines, the Israelites looted their camp.",
      "54": "David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; but he kept Goliath’s armor in his own tent.",

      "20": "Her brother Absalom said to her: “Has your brother Amnon been with you? Keep still now, my sister; he is your brother. Do not take this so to heart.” So Tamar remained, devastated, in the house of her brother Absalom.",

      "27": "But at Absalom’s urging, the king sent Amnon and with him all his other sons. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king.",
      "28": "But Absalom had instructed his attendants: “Now watch! When Amnon is merry with wine and I say to you, ‘Kill Amnon,’ put him to death. Do not be afraid, for it is I who order you to do it. Be strong and act like warriors.”",

      "32": "But Jonadab, son of David’s brother Shimeah, spoke up: “Let not my lord think that all the young men, the king’s sons, have been killed! Amnon alone is dead, for Absalom was set on this ever since Amnon humiliated his sister Tamar.",
      "33": "Now let my lord the king not take so to heart that report, ‘All the king’s sons are dead.’ Amnon alone is dead.”",
      "34": "Meanwhile, Absalom had taken flight. Then the servant on watch looked out and saw a large group coming down the slope from the direction of Bahurim. He came in and reported this to the king: “I saw some men coming down the mountainside from the direction of Bahurim.”",

      "7": "Then the whole clan confronted your servant and demanded: ‘Give up the one who struck down his brother. We must put him to death for the life of his brother whom he has killed; we must do away with the heir also.’ Thus they will quench my remaining hope and leave my husband neither name nor posterity upon the earth.”",

      "12": "But the woman continued, “Please let your servant say still another word to my lord the king.” He replied, “Speak.”",
      "13": "So the woman said: “Why, then, do you think the way you do against the people of God? In pronouncing as he has, the king shows himself guilty, in not bringing back his own banished son.",
      "14": "We must indeed die; we are then like water that is poured out on the ground and cannot be gathered up. Yet, though God does not bring back to life, he does devise means so as not to banish anyone from him.",
      "15": "And now, if I have presumed to speak to the king of this matter, it is because the people have given me cause to fear. And so your servant thought: ‘Let me speak to the king. Perhaps he will grant the petition of his servant.",
      "16": "For the king must surely listen and rescue his servant from the grasp of one who would destroy both me and my son from the heritage of God.’",
      "17": "And your servant says, ‘Let the word of my lord the king lead to rest; indeed, my lord the king is like an angel of God, discerning good and evil. The LORD your God be with you.’ ”",
      "18": "The king answered the woman, “Now do not conceal from me anything I may ask you!” The woman said, “Let my lord the king speak.”",
      "19": "So the king asked, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman answered: “As you live, my lord the king, it is just as my lord has said, and not otherwise. It was your servant Joab who instructed me and told your servant all these things she was to say.",
      "20": "Your servant Joab did this in order to approach the matter in a roundabout way. But my lord is wise with the wisdom of an angel of God, knowing all things on earth.”",
      "21": "Then the king said to Joab: “I am granting this request. Go and bring back young Absalom.”",
      "22": "Falling to the ground in homage and blessing the king, Joab said, “This day your servant knows that I am in good favor with you, my lord king, since the king has granted the request of your servant.”",
      "23": "Joab then went off to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.",
      "24": "But the king said, “Let him go off to his own house; he shall not appear before me.” So Absalom went off to his house and did not appear before the king.",
