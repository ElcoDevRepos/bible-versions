      "4": "And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.",
      "5": "God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.",
      "6": "Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”",
      "7": "Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.",
      "8": "And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.",
      "9": "Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so.",

      "14": "Then God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;",
      "15": "and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so.",
      "16": "Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.",
      "17": "God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth,",
      "18": "and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.",

      "20": "Then God said, “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.”",
      "21": "So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.",
      "22": "And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”",

      "27": "So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.",

      "11": "The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which skirts the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.",
      "12": "And the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and the onyx stone are there.",
      "13": "The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which goes around the whole land of Cush.",
      "14": "The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one which goes toward the east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.",
      "15": "Then the LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it.",
      "16": "And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;",
      "17": "but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”",
      "18": "And the LORD God said, “ It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.”",
      "19": "Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.",
      "20": "So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him.",
      "21": "And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.",
      "22": "Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.",
      "23": "And Adam said: “This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.”",

      "3": "but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ”",

      "5": "For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”",
      "6": "So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.",
      "7": "Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.",
      "8": "And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.",

      "11": "And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?”",
      "12": "Then the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”",
      "13": "And the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”",

      "15": "And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel.”",
      "16": "To the woman He said: “I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; In pain you shall bring forth children; Your desire shall be for your husband, And he shall rule over you.”",
      "17": "Then to Adam He said, “Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it’: “Cursed is the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life.",
      "18": "Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, And you shall eat the herb of the field.",
      "19": "In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread Till you return to the ground, For out of it you were taken; For dust you are, And to dust you shall return.”",
      "20": "And Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.",
      "21": "Also for Adam and his wife the LORD God made tunics of skin, and clothed them.",

      "23": "therefore the LORD God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.",

      "27": "He also made ten carts of bronze; four cubits was the length of each cart, four cubits its width, and three cubits its height.",
      "28": "And this was the design of the carts: They had panels, and the panels were between frames;",
      "29": "on the panels that were between the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. And on the frames was a pedestal on top. Below the lions and oxen were wreaths of plaited work.",

      "32": "Under the panels were the four wheels, and the axles of the wheels were joined to the cart. The height of a wheel was one and a half cubits.",
      "33": "The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel; their axle pins, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all of cast bronze.",
      "34": "And there were four supports at the four corners of each cart; its supports were part of the cart itself.",
      "35": "On the top of the cart, at the height of half a cubit, it was perfectly round. And on the top of the cart, its flanges and its panels were of the same casting.",
      "36": "On the plates of its flanges and on its panels he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was a clear space on each, with wreaths all around.",
      "37": "Thus he made the ten carts. All of them were of the same mold, one measure, and one shape.",
      "38": "Then he made ten lavers of bronze; each laver contained forty baths, and each laver was four cubits. On each of the ten carts was a laver.",
      "39": "And he put five carts on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the Sea on the right side of the house, toward the southeast.",

      "47": "And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.",
