      "2": "And he had two wives: the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.",
      "3": "Now this man would go up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas were priests to the LORD there.",
      "4": "And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters;",
      "5": "but to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had closed her womb.",
      "6": "Her rival, however, would provoke her bitterly to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.",
      "7": "And it happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she would provoke her, so she wept and would not eat.",
      "8": "Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat and why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "Then Hannah rose after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.",
      "10": "And she, greatly distressed, prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly.",
      "11": "And she made a vow and said, “O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy maidservant and remember me, and not forget Thy maidservant, but wilt give Thy maidservant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and a razor shall never come on his head.”",
      "12": "Now it came about, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli was watching her mouth.",
      "13": "As for Hannah, she was speaking in her heart, only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.",

      "16": "“Do not consider your maidservant as a worthless woman; for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation.”",
      "17": "Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him.”",
      "18": "And she said, “Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.",

      "23": "And Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you. Remain until you have weaned him; only may the LORD confirm His word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.",
      "24": "Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three-year-old bull and one ephah of flour and a jug of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh, although the child was young.",

      "16": "And if the man said to him, “They must surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as you desire,” then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.”",

      "23": "And he said to them, “Why do you do such things, the evil things that I hear from all these people?",

Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant;",

      "25": "Now in all Israel was no one as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no defect in him.",
      "26": "And when he cut the hair of his head (and it was at the end of every year that he cut it, for it was heavy on him so he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at 200 shekels by the king’s weight.",
      "27": "And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance.",
      "28": "Now Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and did not see the king’s face.",
      "29": "Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent again a second time, but he would not come.",

It would be better for me still to be there.”’ Now therefore, let me see the king’s face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him put me to death.”",
