      "15": "He fashioned the two pillars of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both.",
      "16": "He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits.",
      "17": "There were nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.",

      "22": "On the top of the pillars was lily design. So the work of the pillars was finished.",

      "26": "It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, as a lily blossom; it could hold two thousand baths.",
      "27": "Then he made the ten stands of bronze; the length of each stand was four cubits and its width four cubits and its height three cubits.",
      "28": "This was the design of the stands: they had borders, even borders between the frames,",
      "29": "and on the borders which were between the frames were lions, oxen and cherubim; and on the frames there was a pedestal above, and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.",
      "30": "Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports; beneath the basin were cast supports with wreaths at each side.",
      "31": "Its opening inside the crown at the top was a cubit, and its opening was round like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its opening there were engravings, and their borders were square, not round.",
      "32": "The four wheels were underneath the borders, and the axles of the wheels were on the stand. And the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.",
      "33": "The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.",
      "34": "Now there were four supports at the four corners of each stand; its supports were part of the stand itself.",
      "35": "On the top of the stand there was a circular form half a cubit high, and on the top of the stand its stays and its borders were part of it.",
      "36": "He engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders, cherubim, lions and palm trees, according to the clear space on each, with wreaths all around.",
      "37": "He made the ten stands like this: all of them had one casting, one measure and one form.",
      "38": "He made ten basins of bronze, one basin held forty baths; each basin was four cubits, and on each of the ten stands was one basin.",
      "39": "Then he set the stands, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea of cast metal on the right side of the house eastward toward the south.",
      "40": "Now Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work which he performed for King Solomon in the house of the LORD:",

      "46": "In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.",
      "47": "Solomon left all the utensils unweighed, because they were too many; the weight of the bronze could not be ascertained.",
      "48": "Solomon made all the furniture which was in the house of the LORD: the golden altar and the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;",
