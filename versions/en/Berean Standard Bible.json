      "6": "And God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.”",

      "14": "The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.",

      "18": "The LORD God also said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.”",
      "19": "And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and He brought them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.",
      "20": "The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.",

      "3": "but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You must not eat of it or touch it, or you will die.’”",

      "5": "“For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”",
      "6": "When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom, she took the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.",
      "7": "And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed together fig leaves and made coverings for themselves.",

      "12": "And the man answered, “The woman whom You gave me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”",
      "13": "Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” “The serpent deceived me,” she replied, “and I ate.”",
      "14": "So the LORD God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and every beast of the field! On your belly will you go, and dust you will eat, all the days of your life.",
      "15": "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.”",
      "16": "To the woman He said: “I will sharply increase your pain in childbirth; in pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.”",
      "17": "And to Adam He said: “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat, cursed is the ground because of you; through toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.",
      "18": "Both thorns and thistles it will yield for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.",
      "19": "By the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread, until you return to the ground—because out of it were you taken. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return.”",
      "20": "And Adam named his wife Eve, because she would be the mother of all the living.",
      "21": "And the LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them.",

      "23": "Therefore the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.",

      "7": "If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you refuse to do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must master it.”",

      "6": "“Is he well?” Jacob inquired. “Yes,” they answered, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with his sheep.”",
      "7": "“Look,” said Jacob, “it is still broad daylight; it is not yet time to gather the livestock. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”",
      "8": "But they replied, “We cannot, until all the flocks have been gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”",
      "9": "While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.",
      "10": "As soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his mother’s brother Laban, with Laban’s sheep, he went up and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep.",
      "11": "Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.",
      "12": "He told Rachel that he was Rebekah’s son, a relative of her father, and she ran and told her father.",
      "13": "When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran out to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him all that had happened.",
      "14": "Then Laban declared, “You are indeed my own flesh and blood.” After Jacob had stayed with him a month,",
      "15": "Laban said to him, “Just because you are my relative, should you work for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”",
      "16": "Now Laban had two daughters; the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel.",
      "17": "Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful.",
      "18": "Since Jacob loved Rachel, he answered, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”",
      "19": "Laban replied, “Better that I give her to you than to another. Stay here with me.”",
      "20": "So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, yet it seemed but a few days because of his love for her.",
      "21": "Finally Jacob said to Laban, “Grant me my wife, for my time is complete, and I want to sleep with her.”",
      "22": "So Laban invited all the men of that place and prepared a feast.",
      "23": "But when evening came, Laban took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her.",
      "24": "And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maidservant.",
      "25": "When morning came, there was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob said to Laban. “Wasn’t it for Rachel that I served you? Why have you deceived me?”",
      "26": "Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older.",
      "27": "Finish this week’s celebration, and we will give you the younger one in return for another seven years of work.”",
      "28": "And Jacob did just that. He finished the week’s celebration, and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.",
      "29": "Laban also gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.",
      "30": "Jacob slept with Rachel as well, and indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. So he worked for Laban another seven years.",
      "31": "When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.",
      "32": "And Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she named him Reuben, for she said, “The LORD has seen my affliction. Surely my husband will love me now.”",
      "33": "Again she conceived and gave birth to a son, and she said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has given me this son as well.” So she named him Simeon.",
      "34": "Once again Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi.",
      "35": "And once more she conceived and gave birth to a son and said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” So she named him Judah. Then Leah stopped having children."

    "30": {
      "1": "When Rachel saw that she was not bearing any children for Jacob, she envied her sister. “Give me children, or I will die!” she said to Jacob.",
      "2": "Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld children from you?”",
      "3": "Then she said, “Here is my maidservant Bilhah. Sleep with her, that she may bear children for me, so that through her I too can build a family.”",
      "4": "So Rachel gave Jacob her servant Bilhah as a wife, and he slept with her,",
      "5": "and Bilhah conceived and bore him a son.",
      "6": "Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; He has heard my plea and given me a son.” So she named him Dan.",
      "7": "And Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.",
      "8": "Then Rachel said, “In my great struggles, I have wrestled with my sister and won.” So she named him Naphtali.",
      "9": "When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife.",
      "10": "And Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.",
      "11": "Then Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad.",
      "12": "When Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,",
      "13": "Leah said, “How happy I am! For the women call me happy.” So she named him Asher.",
      "14": "Now during the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found some mandrakes in the field. When he brought them to his mother, Rachel begged Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”",
      "15": "But Leah replied, “Is it not enough that you have taken away my husband? Now you want to take my son’s mandrakes as well?” “Very well,” said Rachel, “he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”",
      "16": "When Jacob came in from the field that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come with me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night.",
      "17": "And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore a fifth son to Jacob.",
      "18": "Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar.",
      "19": "Again Leah conceived and bore a sixth son to Jacob.",
      "20": "“God has given me a good gift,” she said. “This time my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons.” And she named him Zebulun.",
      "21": "After that, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.",
      "22": "Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her and opened her womb,",
      "23": "and she conceived and gave birth to a son. “God has taken away my shame,” she said.",
      "24": "She named him Joseph, and said, “May the LORD add to me another son.”",
      "25": "Now after Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can return to my homeland.",
      "26": "Give me my wives and children for whom I have served you, that I may go on my way. You know how hard I have worked for you.”",
      "27": "But Laban replied, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.”",
      "28": "And he added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”",
      "29": "Then Jacob answered, “You know how I have served you and how your livestock have thrived under my care.",
      "30": "Indeed, you had very little before my arrival, but now your wealth has increased many times over. The LORD has blessed you wherever I set foot. But now, when may I also provide for my own household?”",
      "31": "“What can I give you?” Laban asked. “You do not need to give me anything,” Jacob replied. “If you do this one thing for me, I will keep on shepherding and keeping your flocks.",
      "32": "Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and every spotted or speckled goat. These will be my wages.",
      "33": "So my honesty will testify for me when you come to check on my wages in the future. If I have any goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not dark-colored, they will be considered stolen.”",
      "34": "“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”",
      "35": "That very day Laban removed all the streaked or spotted male goats and every speckled or spotted female goat—every one that had any white on it—and every dark-colored lamb, and he placed them under the care of his sons.",
      "36": "Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was shepherding the rest of Laban’s flocks.",
      "37": "Jacob, however, took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled the bark, exposing the white inner wood of the branches.",
      "38": "Then he set the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of the flocks coming in to drink. So when the flocks were in heat and came to drink,",
      "39": "they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.",
      "40": "Jacob set apart the young, but made the rest face the streaked dark-colored sheep in Laban’s flocks. Then he set his own stock apart and did not put them with Laban’s animals.",
      "41": "Whenever the stronger females of the flock were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs, in full view of the animals, so that they would breed in front of the branches.",
      "42": "But if the animals were weak, he did not set out the branches. So the weaker animals went to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob.",
      "43": "Thus Jacob became exceedingly prosperous. He owned large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys."
    },
    "31": {
      "1": "Now Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken away all that belonged to our father and built all this wealth at our father’s expense.”",
      "2": "And Jacob saw from the countenance of Laban that his attitude toward him had changed.",
      "3": "Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.”",
      "4": "So Jacob sent word and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flocks were,",
      "5": "and he told them, “I can see from your father’s countenance that his attitude toward me has changed; but the God of my father has been with me.",
      "6": "You know that I have served your father with all my strength.",
      "7": "And although he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, God has not allowed him to harm me.",
      "8": "If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then the whole flock bore speckled offspring. If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then the whole flock bore streaked offspring.",
      "9": "Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me.",
      "10": "When the flocks were breeding, I saw in a dream that the streaked, spotted, and speckled males were mating with the females.",
      "11": "In that dream the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I replied, ‘Here I am.’",
      "12": "‘Look up,’ he said, ‘and see that all the males that are mating with the flock are streaked, spotted, or speckled; for I have seen all that Laban has done to you.",
      "13": "I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and made a solemn vow to Me. Now get up, leave this land at once, and return to your native land.’”",
      "14": "And Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we have any portion or inheritance left in our father’s house?",
      "15": "Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? Not only has he sold us, but he has certainly squandered what was paid for us.",
      "16": "Surely all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has told you.”",
      "17": "Then Jacob got up and put his children and his wives on camels,",
      "18": "and he drove all his livestock before him, along with all the possessions he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land in Canaan.",
      "19": "Now while Laban was out shearing his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household idols.",
      "20": "Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was running away.",
      "21": "So he fled with all his possessions, crossed the Euphrates, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.",
      "22": "On the third day Laban was informed that Jacob had fled.",
      "23": "So he took his relatives with him, pursued Jacob for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.",
      "24": "But that night God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream and warned him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”",
      "25": "Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there as well.",
      "26": "Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me and carried off my daughters like captives of war!",
      "27": "Why did you run away secretly and deceive me, without even telling me? I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and harps.",
      "28": "But you did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. Now you have done a foolish thing.",
      "29": "I have power to do you great harm, but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’",
      "30": "Now you have gone off because you long for your father’s house. But why have you stolen my gods?”",
      "31": "“I was afraid,” Jacob answered, “for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.",
      "32": "If you find your gods with anyone here, he shall not live! In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself if anything is yours, and take it back.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the idols.",
      "33": "So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, then Leah’s tent, and then the tents of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent.",
      "34": "Now Rachel had taken Laban’s household idols, put them in the saddlebag of her camel, and was sitting on them. And Laban searched everything in the tent but found nothing.",
      "35": "Rachel said to her father, “Sir, do not be angry that I cannot stand up before you; for I am having my period.” So Laban searched but could not find the household idols.",
      "36": "Then Jacob became incensed and challenged Laban. “What is my crime?” he said. “For what sin of mine have you so hotly pursued me?",
      "37": "You have searched all my goods! Have you found anything that belongs to you? Put it here before my brothers and yours, that they may judge between the two of us.",
      "38": "I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flock.",
      "39": "I did not bring you anything torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or night.",
      "40": "As it was, the heat consumed me by day and the frost by night, and sleep fled from my eyes.",
      "41": "Thus for twenty years I have served in your household—fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks—and you have changed my wages ten times!",
      "42": "If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, surely by now you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and last night He rendered judgment.”",
      "43": "But Laban answered Jacob, “These daughters are my daughters, these sons are my sons, and these flocks are my flocks! Everything you see is mine! Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine or the children they have borne?",
      "44": "Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between you and me.”",
      "45": "So Jacob picked out a stone and set it up as a pillar,",
      "46": "and he said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and made a mound, and there by the mound they ate.",
      "47": "Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.",
      "48": "Then Laban declared, “This mound is a witness between you and me this day.” Therefore the place was called Galeed.",
      "49": "It was also called Mizpah, because Laban said, “May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are absent from each other.",
      "50": "If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, although no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.”",
      "51": "Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is the mound, and here is the pillar I have set up between you and me.",
      "52": "This mound is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this mound to harm you, and you will not go past this mound and pillar to harm me.",
      "53": "May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.",
      "54": "Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal. And after they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain.",
      "55": "Early the next morning, Laban got up and kissed his grandchildren and daughters and blessed them. Then he left to return home."

      "7": "In great fear and distress, Jacob divided his people into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and camels.",
      "8": "He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the other camp can escape.”",
      "9": "Then Jacob declared, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD who told me, ‘Go back to your country and to your kindred, and I will make you prosper,’",
      "10": "I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan, but now I have become two camps.",
      "11": "Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid that he may come and attack me and the mothers and children with me.",
      "12": "But You have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, too numerous to count.’”",
      "13": "Jacob spent the night there, and from what he had brought with him, he selected a gift for his brother Esau:",

      "15": "30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys.",
      "16": "He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told them, “Go on ahead of me, and keep some distance between the herds.”",
      "17": "He instructed the one in the lead, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, where are you going, and whose animals are these before you?’",
      "18": "then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift, sent to my lord Esau. And behold, Jacob is behind us.’”",
      "19": "He also instructed the second, the third, and all those following behind the herds: “When you meet Esau, you are to say the same thing to him.",
      "20": "You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” For he thought, “I will appease Esau with the gift that is going before me. After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me.”",
      "21": "So Jacob’s gifts went on before him, while he spent the night in the camp.",
      "22": "During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.",
      "23": "He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions.",
      "24": "So Jacob was left all alone, and there a man wrestled with him until daybreak.",
      "25": "When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled.",
      "26": "Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”",
      "27": "“What is your name?” the man asked. “Jacob,” he replied.",
      "28": "Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.”",
      "29": "And Jacob requested, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there.",
      "30": "So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, “Indeed, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”",
      "31": "The sun rose above him as he passed by Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip.",

      "10": "But Jacob insisted, “No, please! If I have found favor in your sight, then receive this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me favorably.",
      "11": "Please accept my gift that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” So Jacob pressed him until he accepted.",
      "12": "Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way, and I will go ahead of you.”",
      "13": "But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard for even a day, all the animals will die.",

      "16": "“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “How can we plead? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed the iniquity of your servants. We are now my lord’s slaves—both we and the one who was found with the cup.”",
      "17": "But Joseph replied, “Far be it from me to do this. The man who was found with the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may return to your father in peace.”",

      "21": "Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so that I can see him for myself.’",
      "22": "So we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.’",
      "23": "But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your younger brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’",
      "24": "Now when we returned to your servant my father, we relayed your words to him.",

      "13": "“Please, my Lord,” Gideon replied, “if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? And where are all His wonders of which our fathers told us, saying, ‘Has not the LORD brought us up out of Egypt?’ But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of Midian.”",
      "14": "The LORD turned to him and said, “Go in the strength you have and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Am I not sending you?”",

      "23": "But the LORD said to him, “Peace be with you. Do not be afraid, for you will not die.”",
      "24": "So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.",

      "28": "When the men of the city got up in the morning, there was Baal’s altar torn down, with the Asherah pole cut down beside it and the second bull offered up on the newly built altar.",
      "29": "“Who did this?” they said to one another. And after they had investigated thoroughly, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash did it.”",
      "30": "Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die, because he has torn down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.”",
      "31": "But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Are you contending for Baal? Are you trying to save him? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal is a god, let him contend for himself with the one who has torn down his altar.”",
      "32": "So on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend with him,” because he had torn down Baal’s altar.",
      "33": "Then all the Midianites, Amalekites, and other people of the east gathered together, crossed over the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.",

      "35": "Calling them to arms, Gideon sent messengers throughout Manasseh, as well as Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, so that they came up to meet him.",
      "36": "Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to save Israel by my hand, as You have said,",
      "37": "then behold, I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that You are going to save Israel by my hand, as You have said.”",
      "38": "And that is what happened. When Gideon arose the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water.",
      "39": "Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me; let me speak one more time. Please allow me one more test with the fleece. This time let it be dry, and the ground covered with dew.”",

      "3": "Now, therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the men: ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand of them turned back, but ten thousand remained.",
      "4": "Then the LORD said to Gideon, “There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go. But if I say, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”",
      "5": "So Gideon brought the men down to the water, and the LORD said to him, “Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel to drink.”",

      "10": "But if you are afraid to do so, then go down to the camp with your servant Purah",
      "11": "and listen to what they are saying. Then your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” So he went with Purah his servant to the outposts where armed men were guarding the camp.",

      "25": "They also captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. So they pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan."

      "24": "He replied, “You took the gods I had made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you say to me, ‘What is the matter with you?’”",
      "25": "The Danites said to him, “Do not raise your voice against us, or angry men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.”",
      "26": "So the Danites went on their way, and Micah turned to go back home, because he saw that they were too strong for him.",
      "27": "After they had taken Micah’s idols and his priest, they went to Laish, to a quiet and unsuspecting people, and they struck them with their swords and burned down the city.",
      "28": "There was no one to deliver them, because the city was far from Sidon and had no alliance with anyone; it was in a valley near Beth-rehob. And the Danites rebuilt the city and lived there.",
      "29": "They named it Dan, after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel—though the city was formerly named Laish.",
      "30": "The Danites set up idols for themselves, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.",

      "2": "Now is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been working, a relative of ours? In fact, tonight he is winnowing barley on the threshing floor.",
      "3": "Therefore wash yourself, put on perfume, and wear your best clothes. Go down to the threshing floor, but do not let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.",
      "4": "When he lies down, note the place where he lies. Then go in and uncover his feet, and lie down, and he will explain to you what you should do.”",
      "5": "“I will do everything you say,” Ruth answered.",
      "6": "So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do.",
      "7": "After Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth went in secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.",
      "8": "At midnight, Boaz was startled, turned over, and there lying at his feet was a woman!",
      "9": "“Who are you?” he asked. “I am your servant Ruth,” she replied. “Spread the corner of your garment over me, for you are a kinsman-redeemer.”",
      "10": "Then Boaz said, “May the LORD bless you, my daughter. You have shown more kindness now than before, because you have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.",
      "11": "And now do not be afraid, my daughter. I will do for you whatever you request, since all my fellow townspeople know that you are a woman of noble character.",
      "12": "Yes, it is true that I am a kinsman-redeemer, but there is a redeemer nearer than I.",
      "13": "Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, good. Let him redeem you. But if he does not want to redeem you, as surely as the LORD lives, I will. Now lie here until morning.”",
      "14": "So she lay down at his feet until morning, but she got up before anyone else could recognize her. Then Boaz said, “Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.”",
      "15": "And he told her, “Bring the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she did so, he poured in six measures of barley and placed it on her. Then he went into the city.",
      "16": "When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked her, “How did it go, my daughter?” Then Ruth told her all that Boaz had done for her.",
      "17": "And she said, “He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, ‘Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’”",
      "18": "“Wait, my daughter,” said Naomi, “until you find out how things go, for he will not rest unless he has resolved the matter today.”"

      "2": "Then Boaz took ten of the elders of the city and said, “Sit here,” and they did so.",
      "3": "And he said to the kinsman-redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.",
      "4": "I thought I should inform you that you may buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do so. But if you will not redeem it, tell me so I may know, because there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.” “I will redeem it,” he replied.",
      "5": "Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi and also from Ruth the Moabitess, you must also acquire the widow of the deceased in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.”",
      "6": "The kinsman-redeemer replied, “I cannot redeem it myself, or I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I cannot redeem it.”",
      "7": "Now in former times in Israel, concerning the redemption or exchange of property, to make any matter legally binding a man would remove his sandal and give it to the other party, and this was a confirmation in Israel.",
      "8": "So the kinsman-redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.”",
      "9": "At this, Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon.",
      "10": "Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to raise up the name of the deceased through his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his brothers or from the gate of his home. You are witnesses today.”",
      "11": "“We are witnesses,” said the elders and all the people at the gate. “May the LORD make the woman entering your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you be prosperous in Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem.",
      "12": "And may your house become like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you by this young woman.”",
      "13": "So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And when he had relations with her, the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.",
      "14": "Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a kinsman-redeemer. May his name become famous in Israel.",
      "15": "He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.”",
      "16": "And Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and became a nurse to him.",
      "17": "The neighbor women said, “A son has been born to Naomi,” and they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, the father of David.",
      "18": "Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,",
      "19": "Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab,",
      "20": "Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, Nahshon was the father of Salmon,",

      "2": "He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.",
      "3": "Year after year Elkanah would go up from his city to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts at Shiloh, where Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD.",
      "4": "And whenever the day came for Elkanah to present his sacrifice, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.",
      "5": "But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved her even though the LORD had closed her womb.",
      "6": "Because the LORD had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival would provoke her viciously to taunt her.",
      "7": "And this went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival taunted her until she wept and would not eat.",
      "8": "“Hannah, why are you crying?” her husband Elkanah asked. “Why won’t you eat? Why is your heart so grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "So after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.",
      "10": "In her bitter distress, Hannah prayed to the LORD and wept with many tears.",
      "11": "And she made a vow, saying, “O LORD of Hosts, if only You will look upon the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, not forgetting Your maidservant but giving her a son, then I will dedicate him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever touch his head.”",
      "12": "As Hannah kept on praying before the LORD, Eli watched her mouth.",

      "14": "and said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine!”",
      "15": "“No, my lord,” Hannah replied. “I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have not had any wine or strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD.",
      "16": "Do not take your servant for a wicked woman, for all this time I have been praying out of the depth of my anguish and grief.”",
      "17": "“Go in peace,” Eli replied, “and may the God of Israel grant the petition you have asked of Him.”",
      "18": "“May your maidservant find favor with you,” said Hannah. Then she went on her way, and she began to eat, and her face was no longer downcast.",
      "19": "The next morning they got up early to bow in worship before the LORD, and then they returned home to Ramah. And Elkanah had relations with his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her.",

      "23": "“Do what you think is best,” her husband Elkanah replied, “and stay here until you have weaned him. Only may the LORD confirm His word.” So Hannah stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.",
      "24": "Once she had weaned him, Hannah took the boy with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. Though the boy was still young, she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.",
      "25": "And when they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli.",

      "14": "and plunge it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or cooking pot. And the priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.",

      "25": "If a man sins against another man, God can intercede for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to their father, since the LORD intended to put them to death.",
      "26": "And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with man.",
      "27": "Then a man of God came to Eli and told him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal Myself to your father’s house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh’s house?",
      "28": "And out of all the tribes of Israel I selected your father to be My priest, to offer sacrifices on My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in My presence. I also gave to the house of your father all the food offerings of the Israelites.",

      "19": "While Saul was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp continued to increase. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”",

      "27": "Jonathan, however, had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath. So he reached out the end of the staff in his hand, dipped it into the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.",
      "28": "Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the troops with a solemn oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’ That is why the people are faint.”",
      "29": "“My father has brought trouble to the land,” Jonathan replied. “Just look at how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.",
      "30": "How much better it would have been if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder they took from their enemies! Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been much greater?”",
      "31": "That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, the people were very faint.",
      "32": "So they rushed greedily to the plunder, taking sheep, cattle, and calves. They slaughtered them on the ground and ate meat with the blood still in it.",
      "33": "Then someone reported to Saul: “Look, the troops are sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.” “You have broken faith,” said Saul. “Roll a large stone over here at once.”",
      "34": "Then he said, “Go among the troops and tell them, ‘Each man must bring me his ox or his sheep, slaughter them in this place, and then eat. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.’” So that night everyone brought his ox and slaughtered it there.",
      "35": "Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had built an altar to the LORD.",
      "36": "And Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until dawn, leaving no man alive!” “Do what seems good to you,” the troops replied. But the priest said, “We must consult God here.”",
      "37": "So Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of Israel?” But God did not answer him that day.",
      "38": "Therefore Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the troops, and let us investigate how this sin has occurred today.",
      "39": "As surely as the LORD who saves Israel lives, even if it is my son Jonathan, he must die!” But not one of the troops said a word.",
      "40": "Then Saul said to all Israel, “You stand on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.” “Do what seems good to you,” the troops replied.",
      "41": "So Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Why have You not answered Your servant this day? If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the fault is with the men of Israel, respond with Thummim.” And Jonathan and Saul were selected, but the people were cleared of the charge.",
      "42": "Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was selected.",
      "43": "“Tell me what you have done,” Saul commanded him. So Jonathan told him, “I only tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. And now I must die?”",
      "44": "And Saul declared, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if you, Jonathan, do not surely die!”",
      "45": "But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die—he who accomplished such a great deliverance for Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for with God’s help he has accomplished this today.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.",
      "46": "Then Saul gave up his pursuit of the Philistines, and the Philistines returned to their own land.",
      "47": "After Saul had assumed the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side—the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he routed them.",
      "48": "He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of its plunderers.",
      "49": "Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. His two daughters were named Merab (his firstborn) and Michal (his younger daughter).",
      "50": "His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Saul’s uncle Ner.",
      "51": "Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel.",

      "32": "Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me this day!",
      "33": "Blessed is your discernment, and blessed are you, because today you kept me from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand.",
      "34": "Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has restrained me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, then surely no male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by morning light.”",

      "37": "In the morning when Nabal was sober, his wife told him about these events, and his heart failed within him, and he became like a stone.",
      "38": "About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal dead.",
      "39": "On hearing that Nabal was dead, David said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has upheld my cause against the reproach of Nabal and has restrained His servant from evil. For the LORD has brought the wickedness of Nabal down upon his own head.” Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.",
      "40": "When his servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said, “David has sent us to take you as his wife.”",
      "41": "She arose, bowed facedown, and said, “Here is your servant, ready to serve and to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”",
      "42": "So Abigail hurried and got on a donkey, and attended by five of her maidens, she followed David’s messengers and became his wife.",

      "11": "But the LORD forbid that I should extend my hand against the LORD’s anointed. Instead, take the spear and water jug by his head, and let us go.”",
      "12": "So David took the spear and water jug by Saul’s head, and they departed. No one saw them or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up; they all remained asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them.",

      "16": "This thing you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, all of you deserve to die, since you did not protect your lord, the LORD’s anointed. Now look around. Where are the king’s spear and water jug that were by his head?”",
      "17": "Then Saul recognized David’s voice and asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” “It is my voice, my lord and king,” David said.",

      "19": "Now please, may my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the LORD has stirred you up against me, then may He accept an offering. But if men have done it, may they be cursed in the presence of the LORD! For today they have driven me away from sharing in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’",

      "2": "He would get up early and stand beside the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone had a grievance to bring before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out and ask, “What city are you from?” And if he replied, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel,”",
      "3": "Absalom would say, “Look, your claims are good and right, but the king has no deputy to hear you.”",
      "4": "And he would add, “If only someone would appoint me judge in the land, then everyone with a grievance or dispute could come to me, and I would give him justice.”",
      "5": "Also, when anyone approached to bow down to him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him.",
      "6": "Absalom did this to all the Israelites who came to the king for justice. In this way he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.",
      "7": "After four years had passed, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go to Hebron to fulfill a vow I have made to the LORD.",
      "8": "For your servant made a vow while dwelling in Geshur of Aram, saying: ‘If indeed the LORD brings me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in Hebron.’”",
      "9": "“Go in peace,” said the king. So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.",
      "10": "Then Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel with this message: “When you hear the sound of the horn, you are to say, ‘Absalom reigns in Hebron!’”",
      "11": "Two hundred men from Jerusalem accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and they went along innocently, for they knew nothing about the matter.",
      "12": "While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from his hometown of Giloh. So the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept increasing.",
      "13": "Then a messenger came to David and reported, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”",
      "14": "And David said to all the servants with him in Jerusalem, “Arise and let us flee, or we will not escape from Absalom! We must leave quickly, or he will soon overtake us, heap disaster on us, and put the city to the sword.”",
      "15": "The king’s servants replied, “Whatever our lord the king decides, we are your servants.”",
      "16": "Then the king set out, and his entire household followed him. But he left behind ten concubines to take care of the palace.",
      "17": "So the king set out with all the people following him. He stopped at the last house,",
      "18": "and all his servants marched past him—all the Cherethites and Pelethites, and six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath.",
      "19": "Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you also go with us? Go back and stay with the new king, since you are both a foreigner and an exile from your homeland.",
      "20": "In fact, you arrived only yesterday; should I make you wander around with us today while I do not know where I am going? Go back and take your brothers with you. May the LORD show you loving devotion and faithfulness.”",
      "21": "But Ittai answered the king, “As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be!”",
      "22": "“March on then,” said David to Ittai. So Ittai the Gittite marched past with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.",
      "23": "Everyone in the countryside was weeping loudly as all the people passed by. And as the king crossed the Kidron Valley, all the people also passed toward the way of the wilderness.",
      "24": "Zadok was also there, and all the Levites with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had passed out of the city.",
      "25": "Then the king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back and let me see both it and His dwelling place again.",
      "26": "But if He should say, ‘I do not delight in you,’ then here I am; let Him do to me whatever seems good to Him.”",
      "27": "The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace—you with your son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar with his son Jonathan.",
      "28": "See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”",
      "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and stayed there.",
      "30": "But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up. His head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. And all the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went.",
      "31": "Now someone told David: “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” So David pleaded, “O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!”",
      "32": "When David came to the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head.",
      "33": "David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.",
      "34": "But you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me if you return to the city and say to Absalom: ‘I will be your servant, my king; in the past I was your father’s servant, but now I will be your servant.’",
      "35": "Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you? Report to them everything you hear from the king’s palace.",
      "36": "Indeed, their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with everything you hear.”",
      "37": "So David’s friend Hushai arrived in Jerusalem just as Absalom was entering the city."

    "16": {
      "1": "When David had gone a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a pair of saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine.",
      "2": "“Why do you have these?” asked the king. Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”",
      "3": "“Where is your master’s grandson?” asked the king. And Ziba answered, “Indeed, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he has said, ‘Today, the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my grandfather.’”",
      "4": "So the king said to Ziba, “All that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!” “I humbly bow before you,” said Ziba. “May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king!”",
      "5": "As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the family of the house of Saul was just coming out. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and as he approached, he kept yelling out curses.",
      "6": "He threw stones at David and at all the servants of the king, though the troops and all the mighty men were on David’s right and left.",
      "7": "And as he yelled curses, Shimei said, “Get out, get out, you worthless man of bloodshed!",
      "8": "The LORD has paid you back for all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, you have come to ruin because you are a man of bloodshed!”",
      "9": "Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!”",
      "10": "But the king replied, “What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses me because the LORD told him, ‘Curse David,’ who can ask, ‘Why did you do this?’”",
      "11": "Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my own son, my own flesh and blood, seeks my life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone and let him curse me, for the LORD has told him so.",
      "12": "Perhaps the LORD will see my affliction and repay me with good for the cursing I receive today.”",
      "13": "So David and his men proceeded along the road as Shimei went along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As Shimei went, he yelled curses, threw stones, and flung dust at David.",
      "14": "Finally, the king and all the people with him arrived, exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.",
      "15": "Then Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.",
      "16": "And David’s friend Hushai the Archite went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”",
      "17": "“Is this the loyalty you show your friend?” Absalom replied. “Why did you not go with your friend?”",
      "18": "“Not at all,” Hushai answered. “For the one chosen by the LORD, by this people, and by all the men of Israel—his I will be, and with him I will remain.",
      "19": "Furthermore, whom should I serve if not his son? As I served in your father’s presence, so also I will serve in yours.”",
      "20": "Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give me counsel. What should we do?”",
      "21": "Ahithophel replied, “Sleep with your father’s concubines, whom he has left to take care of the palace. When all Israel hears that you have become a stench to your father, then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.”",
      "22": "So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.",
      "23": "Now in those days the advice of Ahithophel was like the consultation of the word of God. Such was the regard that both David and Absalom had for Ahithophel’s advice."
    },
    "17": {
      "1": "Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David.",
      "2": "I will attack him while he is weak and weary; I will throw him into a panic, and all the people with him will flee; I will strike down only the king",
      "3": "and bring all the people back to you as a bride returning to her husband. You seek the life of only one man; then all the people will be at peace.”",
      "4": "This proposal seemed good to Absalom and all the elders of Israel.",
      "5": "Then Absalom said, “Summon Hushai the Archite as well, and let us hear what he too has to say.”",
      "6": "So Hushai came to Absalom, who told him, “Ahithophel has spoken this proposal. Should we carry it out? If not, what do you say?”",
      "7": "Hushai replied, “This time the advice of Ahithophel is not sound.”",
      "8": "He continued, “You know your father and his men. They are mighty men, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Moreover, your father is a man of war who will not spend the night with the troops.",
      "9": "Surely by now he is hiding in a cave or some other location. If some of your troops fall first, whoever hears of it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.’",
      "10": "Then even the most valiant soldier with the heart of a lion will melt with fear, because all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man who has valiant men with him.",
      "11": "Instead, I advise that all Israel from Dan to Beersheba—a multitude like the sand on the seashore—be gathered to you, and that you yourself lead them into battle.",
      "12": "Then we will attack David wherever we find him, and we will descend on him like dew on the ground. And of all the men with him, not even one will remain.",
      "13": "If he retreats to a city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a pebble can be found there.”",
      "14": "Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had purposed to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.",
      "15": "So Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, “This is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have advised.",
      "16": "Now send quickly and tell David, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness, but be sure to cross over. Otherwise the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.’”",
      "17": "Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, where a servant girl would come and pass along information to them. They in turn would go and inform King David, for they dared not be seen entering the city.",
      "18": "But a young man did see them and told Absalom. So the two left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.",
      "19": "Then the man’s wife took a covering, spread it over the mouth of the well, and scattered grain over it so nobody would know a thing.",
      "20": "When Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” “They have crossed over the brook,” she replied. The men searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.",
      "21": "After the men had gone, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed up out of the well and went to inform King David, saying, “Get up and cross over the river at once, for Ahithophel has given this advice against you.”",
      "22": "So David and all the people with him got up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one left who had not crossed the Jordan.",
      "23": "When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his affairs in order and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father’s tomb.",
      "24": "Then David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.",
      "25": "Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra, the Ishmaelite who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.",
      "26": "So the Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.",
      "27": "When David came to Mahanaim, he was met by Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim.",
      "28": "They brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,",
      "29": "honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd for David and his people to eat. For they said, “The people have become hungry, exhausted, and thirsty in the wilderness.”"

      "1": "Then David reviewed his troops and appointed over them commanders of thousands and of hundreds.",
      "2": "He sent out the troops, a third under Joab, a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the troops, “I will surely march out with you as well.”",
      "3": "But the people pleaded, “You must not go out! For if we have to flee, they will not care about us. Even if half of us die, they will not care. But you are worth ten thousand of us. It is better now if you support us from the city.”",
      "4": "“I will do whatever seems best to you,” the king replied. So he stood beside the gate, while all the troops marched out by hundreds and by thousands.",
      "5": "Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.” And all the people heard the king’s orders to each of the commanders regarding Absalom.",
      "6": "So David’s army marched into the field to engage Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.",
      "7": "There the people of Israel were defeated by David’s servants, and the slaughter was great that day—twenty thousand men.",
      "8": "The battle spread over the whole countryside, and that day the forest devoured more people than the sword.",
      "9": "Now Absalom was riding on his mule when he met the servants of David, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom’s head was caught fast in the tree. The mule under him kept going, so that he was suspended in midair.",
      "10": "When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, “I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!”",
      "11": "“You just saw him!” Joab exclaimed. “Why did you not strike him to the ground right there? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a warrior’s belt!”",
      "12": "The man replied, “Even if a thousand shekels of silver were weighed out into my hands, I would not raise my hand against the son of the king. For we heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.’",
      "13": "If I had jeopardized my own life—and nothing is hidden from the king—you would have abandoned me.”",
      "14": "But Joab declared, “I am not going to wait like this with you!” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak tree.",
      "15": "And ten young men who carried Joab’s armor surrounded Absalom, struck him, and killed him.",
      "16": "Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and the troops broke off their pursuit of Israel because Joab had restrained them.",
      "17": "They took Absalom, cast him into a large pit in the forest, and piled a huge mound of stones over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled, each to his home.",
      "18": "During his lifetime, Absalom had set up for himself a pillar in the King’s Valley, for he had said, “I have no son to preserve the memory of my name.” So he gave the pillar his name, and to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument.",
      "19": "Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and tell the king the good news that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.”",
      "20": "But Joab replied, “You are not the man to take good news today. You may do it another day, but you must not do so today, because the king’s son is dead.”",
      "21": "So Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed to Joab and took off running.",
      "22": "Ahimaaz son of Zadok, however, persisted and said to Joab, “No matter what, please let me also run behind the Cushite!” “My son,” Joab replied, “why do you want to run, since you will not receive a reward?”",
      "23": "“No matter what, I want to run!” he replied. “Then run!” Joab told him. So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.",
      "24": "Now David was sitting between the two gates when the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall, looked out, and saw a man running alone.",
      "25": "So he called out and told the king. “If he is alone,” the king replied, “he bears good news.” As the first runner drew near,",
      "26": "the watchman saw another man running, and he called out to the gatekeeper, “Look! Another man is running alone!” “This one also brings good news,” said the king.",
      "27": "The watchman said, “The first man appears to me to be running like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” “This is a good man,” said the king. “He comes with good news.”",
      "28": "Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well!” And he bowed facedown before the king. He continued, “Blessed be the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my lord the king.”",
      "29": "The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom all right?” And Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was.”",
      "30": "“Move aside,” said the king, “and stand here.” So he stepped aside.",
      "31": "Just then the Cushite came and said, “May my lord the king hear the good news: Today the LORD has avenged you of all who rose up against you!”",
      "32": "The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom all right?” And the Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you to harm you be like that young man.”",
      "33": "The king was shaken and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he walked, he cried out, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”"

    "19": {
      "1": "Then it was reported to Joab, “The king is weeping and mourning over Absalom.”",
      "2": "And that day’s victory was turned into mourning for all the people, because on that day they were told, “The king is grieving over his son.”",
      "3": "So they returned to the city quietly that day, as people steal away in humiliation after fleeing a battle.",
      "4": "But the king covered his face and cried out at the top of his voice, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”",
      "5": "Then Joab went into the house and said to the king, “Today you have disgraced all your servants who have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, of your wives, and of your concubines.",
      "6": "You love those who hate you and hate those who love you! For you have made it clear today that the commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you. I know today that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, it would have pleased you!",
      "7": "Now therefore get up! Go out and speak comfort to your servants, for I swear by the LORD that if you do not go out, not a man will remain with you tonight. This will be worse for you than all the adversity that has befallen you from your youth until now!”",
      "8": "So the king got up and sat in the gate, and all the people were told: “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” So they all came before the king. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled, each man to his home.",
      "9": "And all the people throughout the tribes of Israel were arguing, “The king rescued us from the hand of our enemies and delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled the land because of Absalom.",
      "10": "But Absalom, the man we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about restoring the king?”",
      "11": "Then King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to restore the king to his palace, since the talk of all Israel has reached the king at his quarters?",
      "12": "You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to restore the king?’",
      "13": "And say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my flesh and blood? May God punish me, and ever so severely, if from now on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab!’”",
      "14": "So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man, and they sent word to the king: “Return, you and all your servants.”",
      "15": "So the king returned, and when he arrived at the Jordan, the men of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across the Jordan.",
      "16": "Then Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David,",
      "17": "along with a thousand men of Benjamin, as well as Ziba the steward of the house of Saul and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed down to the Jordan before the king",
      "18": "and crossed at the ford to carry over the king’s household and to do what was good in his sight. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell down before the king",
      "19": "and said, “My lord, do not hold me guilty, and do not remember your servant’s wrongdoing on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king not take it to heart.",
      "20": "For your servant knows that I have sinned, so here I am today as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”",
      "21": "But Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?”",
      "22": "And David replied, “Sons of Zeruiah, what have I to do with you, that you should be my adversaries today? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? Am I not indeed aware that today I am king over Israel?”",
      "23": "So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king swore an oath to him.",
      "24": "Then Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, went down to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king had left until the day he returned safely.",
      "25": "And he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, who asked him, “Mephibosheth, why did you not go with me?”",
      "26": "“My lord the king,” he replied, “because I am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled so that I may ride on it and go with the king.’ But my servant Ziba deceived me,",
      "27": "and he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. Yet my lord the king is like the angel of God, so do what is good in your eyes.",
      "28": "For all the house of my grandfather deserves death from my lord the king, yet you have set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right, then, do I have to keep appealing to the king?”",
      "29": "The king replied, “Why say any more? I hereby declare that you and Ziba are to divide the land.”",
      "30": "And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Instead, since my lord the king has safely come to his own house, let Ziba take it all!”",
      "31": "Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and send him on his way from there.",
      "32": "Barzillai was quite old, eighty years of age, and since he was a very wealthy man, he had provided for the king while he stayed in Mahanaim.",
      "33": "The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me, and I will provide for you at my side in Jerusalem.”",
      "34": "But Barzillai replied, “How many years of my life remain, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?",
      "35": "I am now eighty years old. Can I discern what is good and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or drinks? Can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?",
      "36": "Your servant will go with the king only a short distance past the Jordan; why should the king repay me with such a reward?",
      "37": "Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight.”",
      "38": "The king replied, “Chimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your sight, and I will do for you whatever you desire of me.”",
      "39": "So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and Barzillai returned home.",
      "40": "Then the king crossed over to Gilgal, and Chimham crossed over with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king.",
      "41": "Soon all the men of Israel came to the king and asked, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, take you away secretly and bring the king and his household across the Jordan, together with all of David’s men?”",
