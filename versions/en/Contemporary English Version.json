      "8": "That night, Saul put on different clothing so nobody would recognize him. Then he and two of his men went to the woman, and asked, \"Will you bring up the ghost of someone for us?\"",
      "9": "The woman said, \"Why are you trying to trick me and get me killed? You know King Saul has killed everyone who talks to the spirits of the dead!\"",

      "14": "\"What does it look like?\" \"It looks like an old man wearing a robe.\" Saul knew it was Samuel, so he bowed down low.",
      "15": "\"Why are you bothering me by bringing me up like this?\" Samuel asked. \"I'm terribly worried,\" Saul answered. \"The Philistines are about to attack me. God has turned his back on me and won't answer any more by prophets or by dreams. What should I do?\"",
      "16": "Samuel said: If the LORD has turned away from you and is now your enemy, don't ask me what to do.",

      "20": "At once, Saul collapsed and lay stretched out on the floor, terrified at what Samuel had said. He was weak because he had not eaten anything since the day before.",

      "22": "Now please listen to me. Let me get you a little something to eat. It will give you strength for your walk back to camp.\"",
      "23": "\"No, I won't eat!\" But his officers and the woman kept on urging Saul, until he finally agreed. He got up off the floor and sat on the bed.",
      "24": "At once the woman killed a calf that she had been fattening up. She cooked part of the meat and baked some thin bread.",
