      "48": "Joseph gathered all the excess food in the land of Egypt during the seven years and put it in the cities. He put the food in every city from the fields around it.",
      "49": "So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance—like the sand of the sea—that he stopped measuring it because it was beyond measure.",
      "50": "Two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine arrived. Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest at On, bore them to him.",

      "52": "And the second son he named Ephraim, meaning, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”",
      "53": "Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end,",
