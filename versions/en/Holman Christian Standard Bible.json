      "48": "Joseph gathered all the excess food in the land of Egypt during the seven years and put it in the cities. He put the food in every city from the fields around it.",
      "49": "So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance—like the sand of the sea—that he stopped measuring it because it was beyond measure.",
      "50": "Two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine arrived. Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest at On, bore them to him.",

      "52": "And the second son he named Ephraim, meaning, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”",
      "53": "Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end,",

      "3": "They replied, “If you send the ark of Israel’s God away, you must not send it without an offering. You must send back a restitution offering to Him, and you will be healed. Then the reason His hand hasn’t been removed from you will be revealed.”",

      "5": "Make images of your tumors and of your mice that are destroying the land. Give glory to Israel’s God, and perhaps He will stop oppressing you, your gods, and your land.",

      "9": "Then watch: If it goes up the road to its homeland toward Beth-shemesh, it is the LORD who has made this terrible trouble for us. However, if it doesn’t, we will know that it was not His hand that punished us—it was just something that happened to us by chance.”",
      "10": "The men did this: They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and confined their calves in the pen.",
      "11": "Then they put the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the box containing the gold mice and the images of their tumors.",
      "12": "The cows went straight up the road to Beth-shemesh. They stayed on that one highway, lowing as they went; they never strayed to the right or to the left. The Philistine rulers were walking behind them to the territory of Beth-shemesh.",

      "18": "The number of gold mice also corresponded to the number of Philistine cities of the five rulers, the fortified cities and the outlying villages. The large rock on which the ark of the LORD was placed is in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh to this day.",

      "10": "Samuel was offering the burnt offering as the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel. The LORD thundered loudly against the Philistines that day and threw them into such confusion that they fled before Israel.",
      "11": "Then the men of Israel charged out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines striking them down all the way to a place below Beth-car.",
      "12": "Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it upright between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, explaining, “The LORD has helped us to this point.”",

      "16": "Every year he would go on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah and would judge Israel at all these locations.",

      "12": "He can appoint them for his use as commanders of thousands or commanders of fifties, to plow his ground or reap his harvest, or to make his weapons of war or the equipment for his chariots.",
      "13": "He can take your daughters to become perfumers, cooks, and bakers.",

      "4": "Saul and his attendant went through the hill country of Ephraim and then through the region of Shalishah, but they didn’t find them. They went through the region of Shaalim—nothing. Then they went through the Benjaminite region but still didn’t find them.",

      "21": "Saul responded, “Am I not a Benjaminite from the smallest of Israel’s tribes and isn’t my clan the least important of all the clans of the Benjaminite tribe? So why have you said something like this to me?”",
      "22": "Samuel took Saul and his attendant, brought them to the banquet hall, and gave them a place at the head of the 30 or so men who had been invited.",
      "23": "Then Samuel said to the cook, “Get the portion of meat that I gave you and told you to set aside.”",

Eat it because it was saved for you for this solemn event at the time I said, ‘I’ve invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.",
