      "5": "Make images of your tumors and of your mice that are destroying the land. Give glory to Israel’s God, and perhaps He will stop oppressing you, your gods, and your land.",

      "10": "The men did this: They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and confined their calves in the pen.",
      "11": "Then they put the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the box containing the gold mice and the images of their tumors.",
      "12": "The cows went straight up the road to Beth-shemesh. They stayed on that one highway, lowing as they went; they never strayed to the right or to the left. The Philistine rulers were walking behind them to the territory of Beth-shemesh.",

      "10": "Samuel was offering the burnt offering as the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel. The LORD thundered loudly against the Philistines that day and threw them into such confusion that they fled before Israel.",
      "11": "Then the men of Israel charged out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines striking them down all the way to a place below Beth-car.",
      "12": "Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it upright between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, explaining, “The LORD has helped us to this point.”",

      "21": "Saul responded, “Am I not a Benjaminite from the smallest of Israel’s tribes and isn’t my clan the least important of all the clans of the Benjaminite tribe? So why have you said something like this to me?”",
      "22": "Samuel took Saul and his attendant, brought them to the banquet hall, and gave them a place at the head of the 30 or so men who had been invited.",

Eat it because it was saved for you for this solemn event at the time I said, ‘I’ve invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.",

      "20": "Joab your servant has done this to address the issue indirectly, but my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the Angel of God, knowing everything on earth.”",

      "22": "Joab fell with his face to the ground in homage and praised the king. “Today,” Joab said, “your servant knows I have found favor with you, my lord the king, because the king has granted the request of your servant.”",
      "23": "So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.",
      "24": "However, the king added, “He may return to his house, but he may not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his house, but he did not see the king.",
      "25": "No man in all Israel was as handsome and highly praised as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw.",
      "26": "When he shaved his head—he shaved it every year because his hair got so heavy for him that he had to shave it off—he would weigh the hair from his head and it would be five pounds according to the royal standard.",

      "31": "Then Joab came to Absalom’s house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?\"”",
      "32": "Look,” Absalom explained to Joab, “I sent for you and said, ‘Come here. I want to send you to the king to ask: Why have I come back from Geshur? I’d be better off if I were still there.’ So now, let me see the king. If I am guilty, let him kill me.”",
      "33": "Joab went to the king and told him. So David summoned Absalom, who came to the king and bowed down with his face to the ground before him. Then the king kissed Absalom."

      "3": "Absalom said to him, “Look, your claims are good and right, but the king does not have anyone to listen to you.”",
      "4": "He added, “If only someone would appoint me judge in the land. Then anyone who had a grievance or dispute could come to me, and I would make sure he received justice.”",
      "5": "When a person approached to bow down to him, Absalom reached out his hand, took hold of him, and kissed him.",
      "6": "Absalom did this to all the Israelites who came to the king for a settlement. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.",
      "7": "When four years had passed, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go to Hebron to fulfill a vow I made to the LORD.",

      "11": "Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom. They had been invited and were going innocently, for they knew nothing about the whole matter.",
      "12": "While he was offering the sacrifices, Absalom sent for David’s adviser Ahithophel the Gilonite, from his city of Giloh. So the conspiracy grew strong, and the people supporting Absalom continued to increase.",

      "20": "Besides, you only arrived yesterday; should I make you wander around with us today while I go wherever I can? Go back and take your brothers with you. May the LORD show you kindness and faithfulness.”",
      "21": "But in response, Ittai vowed to the king, “As the LORD lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king is, whether it means life or death, your servant will be there!\"”",
      "22": "March on,” David replied to Ittai. So Ittai the Gittite marched past with all his men and the children who were with him.",
      "23": "Everyone in the countryside was weeping loudly while all the people were marching past. As the king was crossing the Kidron Valley, all the people were marching past on the road that leads to the desert.",
      "24": "Zadok was also there, and all the Levites with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set the ark of God down, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until the people had finished marching past.",

      "26": "However, if He should say, ‘I do not delight in you,’ then here I am—He can do with me whatever pleases Him.”",
      "27": "The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Look, return to the city in peace and your two sons with you: your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan.",
      "28": "Remember, I’ll wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”",

      "31": "Then someone reported to David: “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.\"” LORD,” David pleaded, “please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!”",
      "32": "When David came to the summit where he used to worship God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head.",

      "34": "but if you return to the city and tell Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, my king! Previously, I was your father’s servant, but now I will be your servant,’ then you can counteract Ahithophel’s counsel for me.",
      "35": "Won’t Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you? Report everything you hear from the king’s palace to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",
      "36": "Take note: their two sons, Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan, are there with them. Send me everything you hear through them.”",

      "2": "The king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?” Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those to drink who become exhausted in the desert.\"”",
      "3": "Where is your master’s grandson?” the king asked.” Why, he’s staying in Jerusalem,” Ziba replied to the king, “for he said, ‘Today, the house of Israel will restore my grandfather’s kingdom to me.’”",

      "10": "The king replied, “Sons of Zeruiah, do we agree on anything? He curses me this way because the LORD told him, ‘Curse David!’ Therefore, who can say, ‘Why did you do that?’”",
      "11": "Then David said to Abishai and all his servants, “Look, my own son, my own flesh and blood, intends to take my life—how much more now this Benjaminite! Leave him alone and let him curse me; the LORD has told him to.",
      "12": "Perhaps the LORD will see my affliction and restore goodness to me instead of Shimei’s curses today.”",
      "13": "So David and his men proceeded along the road as Shimei was going along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As Shimei went, he cursed David, and threw stones and dirt at him.",
      "14": "Finally, the king and all the people with him arrived exhausted, so they rested there.",

      "17": "Is this your loyalty to your friend?” Absalom asked Hushai. “Why didn’t you go with your friend?\"”",
      "18": "Not at all,” Hushai answered Absalom. “I am on the side of the one that the LORD, the people, and all the men of Israel have chosen. I will stay with him.",
      "19": "Furthermore, whom will I serve if not his son? As I served in your father’s presence, I will also serve in yours.”",

      "47": "Solomon left all the utensils unweighed because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.",
