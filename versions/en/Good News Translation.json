      "14": "But he would not listen to her; and since he was stronger than she was, he overpowered her and raped her.",
      "15": "Then Amnon was filled with a deep hatred for her; he hated her now even more than he had loved her before. He said to her, \"Get out!\"",
      "16": "\"No,\" she answered. \"To send me away like this is a greater crime than what you just did!\" But Amnon would not listen to her;",
      "17": "he called in his personal servant and said, \"Get this woman out of my sight! Throw her out and lock the door!\"",

      "20": "When her brother Absalom saw her, he asked, \"Has Amnon molested you? Please, sister, don't let it upset you so much. He is your half brother, so don't tell anyone about it.\" So Tamar lived in Absalom's house, sad and lonely.",
      "21": "When King David heard what had happened, he was furious.",

      "25": "\"No, my son,\" the king answered. \"It would be too much trouble for you if we all went.\" Absalom insisted, but the king would not give in, and he asked Absalom to leave.",
      "26": "But Absalom said, \"Well, then, will you at least let my brother Amnon come?\" \"Why should he?\" the king asked.",
      "27": "But Absalom kept on insisting until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king",
      "28": "and instructed his servants: \"Notice when Amnon has had too much to drink, and then when I give the order, kill him. Don't be afraid. I will take the responsibility myself. Be brave and don't hesitate!\"",
      "29": "So the servants followed Absalom's instructions and killed Amnon. All the rest of David's sons mounted their mules and fled.",
      "30": "While they were on their way home, David was told: \"Absalom has killed all your sons--not one of them is left!\"",
      "31": "The king stood up, tore his clothes in sorrow, and threw himself to the ground. The servants who were there with him tore their clothes also.",
      "32": "But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah, said, \"Your Majesty, they haven't killed all your sons. Only Amnon is dead. You could tell by looking at Absalom that he had made up his mind to do this from the time that Amnon raped his sister Tamar.",
      "33": "So don't believe the news that all your sons are dead; only Amnon was killed.\"",
      "34": "In the meantime Absalom had fled. Just then the soldier on sentry duty saw a large crowd coming down the hill on the road from Horonaim. He went to the king and reported what he had seen.",
      "35": "Jonadab said to David, \"Those are your sons coming, just as I said they would.\"",
      "36": "As soon as he finished saying this, David's sons came in; they started crying, and David and his officials also cried bitterly.",

      "5": "His wife Jezebel went to him and asked, \"Why are you so depressed? Why won't you eat?\"",
      "6": "He answered, \"Because of what Naboth said to me. I offered to buy his vineyard or, if he preferred, to give him another one for it, but he told me that I couldn't have it!\"",
      "7": "\"Well, are you the king or aren't you?\" Jezebel replied. \"Get out of bed, cheer up, and eat. I will get you Naboth's vineyard!\"",

      "29": "Elisha turned to Gehazi and said, \"Hurry! Take my walking stick and go. Don't stop to greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, don't take time to answer. Go straight to the house and hold my stick over the boy.\"",

      "40": "And then there will be a fourth empire, as strong as iron, which shatters and breaks everything. And just as iron shatters everything, it will shatter and crush all the earlier empires.",
      "41": "You also saw that the feet and the toes were partly clay and partly iron. This means that it will be a divided empire. It will have something of the strength of iron, because there was iron mixed with the clay.",
      "42": "The toes--partly iron and partly clay--mean that part of the empire will be strong and part of it weak.",
      "43": "You also saw that the iron was mixed with the clay. This means that the rulers of that empire will try to unite their families by intermarriage, but they will not be able to, any more than iron can mix with clay.",
      "44": "At the time of those rulers the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never end. It will never be conquered, but will completely destroy all those empires and then last forever.",
      "45": "You saw how a stone broke loose from a cliff without anyone touching it and how it struck the statue made of iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God is telling Your Majesty what will happen in the future. I have told you exactly what you dreamed, and have given you its true meaning.\"",

      "23": "The king was overjoyed and gave orders for Daniel to be pulled up out of the pit. So they pulled him up and saw that he had not been hurt at all, for he trusted God.",
      "24": "Then the king gave orders to arrest all those who had accused Daniel, and he had them thrown, together with their wives and children, into the pit filled with lions. Before they even reached the bottom of the pit, the lions pounced on them and broke all their bones.",

      "1": "In the first year that Belshazzar was king of Babylonia, I had a dream and saw a vision in the night. I wrote the dream down, and this is the record",
      "2": "of what I saw that night: Winds were blowing from all directions and lashing the surface of the ocean.",
      "3": "Four huge beasts came up out of the ocean, each one different from the others.",
      "4": "The first one looked like a lion, but had wings like an eagle. While I was watching, the wings were torn off. The beast was lifted up and made to stand up straight. And then a human mind was given to it.",
      "5": "The second beast looked like a bear standing on its hind legs. It was holding three ribs between its teeth, and a voice said to it, \"Go on, eat as much meat as you can!\"",
      "6": "While I was watching, another beast appeared. It looked like a leopard, but on its back there were four wings, like the wings of a bird, and it had four heads. It had a look of authority about it.",
      "7": "As I was watching, a fourth beast appeared. It was powerful, horrible, terrifying. With its huge iron teeth it crushed its victims, and then it trampled on them. Unlike the other beasts, it had ten horns.",
      "8": "While I was staring at the horns, I saw a little horn coming up among the others. It tore out three of the horns that were already there. This horn had human eyes and a mouth that was boasting proudly.",
      "9": "While I was looking, thrones were put in place. One who had been living forever sat down on one of the thrones. His clothes were white as snow, and his hair was like pure wool. His throne, mounted on fiery wheels, was blazing with fire,",
      "10": "and a stream of fire was pouring out from it. There were many thousands of people there to serve him, and millions of people stood before him. The court began its session, and the books were opened.",
      "11": "While I was looking, I could still hear the little horn bragging and boasting. As I watched, the fourth beast was killed, and its body was thrown into the flames and destroyed.",
      "12": "The other beasts had their power taken away, but they were permitted to go on living for a limited time.",
      "13": "During this vision in the night, I saw what looked like a human being. He was approaching me, surrounded by clouds, and he went to the one who had been living forever and was presented to him.",
      "14": "He was given authority, honor, and royal power, so that the people of all nations, races, and languages would serve him. His authority would last forever, and his kingdom would never end.",
      "15": "The visions I saw alarmed me, and I was deeply disturbed.",
      "16": "I went up to one of those standing there and asked him to explain it all. So he told me the meaning.",
      "17": "He said, \"These four huge beasts are four empires which will arise on earth.",
      "18": "And the people of the Supreme God will receive royal power and keep it forever and ever.\"",
      "19": "Then I wanted to know more about the fourth beast, which was not like any of the others--the terrifying beast which crushed its victims with its bronze claws and iron teeth and then trampled on them.",
      "20": "And I wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and the horn that had come up afterward and had made three of the horns fall. It had eyes and a mouth and was boasting proudly. It was more terrifying than any of the others.",
      "21": "While I was looking, that horn made war on God's people and conquered them.",
      "22": "Then the one who had been living forever came and pronounced judgment in favor of the people of the Supreme God. The time had arrived for God's people to receive royal power.",
      "23": "This is the explanation I was given: \"The fourth beast is a fourth empire that will be on the earth and will be different from all other empires. It will crush the whole earth and trample it down.",
      "24": "The ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king will appear; he will be very different from the earlier ones and will overthrow three kings.",
      "25": "He will speak against the Supreme God and oppress God's people. He will try to change their religious laws and festivals, and God's people will be under his power for three and a half years.",
      "26": "Then the heavenly court will sit in judgment, take away his power, and destroy him completely.",
      "27": "The power and greatness of all the kingdoms on earth will be given to the people of the Supreme God. Their royal power will never end, and all rulers on earth will serve and obey them.\"",

      "1": "In the third year that Belshazzar was king, I saw a second vision.",
      "2": "In the vision I suddenly found myself in the walled city of Susa in the province of Elam. I was standing by the Ulai River,",
      "3": "and there beside the river I saw a ram that had two long horns, one of which was longer and newer than the other.",
      "4": "I watched the ram butting with his horns to the west, the north, and the south. No animal could stop him or escape his power. He did as he pleased and grew arrogant.",
      "5": "While I was wondering what this meant, a goat came rushing out of the west, moving so fast that his feet didn't touch the ground. He had one prominent horn between his eyes.",
      "6": "He came toward the ram, which I had seen standing beside the river, and rushed at him with all his force.",
      "7": "I watched him attack the ram. He was so angry that he smashed into him and broke the two horns. The ram had no strength to resist. He was thrown to the ground and trampled on, and there was no one who could save him.",
      "8": "The goat grew more and more arrogant, but at the height of his power his horn was broken. In its place four prominent horns came up, each pointing in a different direction.",
      "9": "Out of one of these four horns grew a little horn, whose power extended toward the south and the east and toward the Promised Land.",
      "10": "It grew strong enough to attack the army of heaven, the stars themselves, and it threw some of them to the ground and trampled on them.",
      "11": "It even defied the Prince of the heavenly army, stopped the daily sacrifices offered to him, and ruined the Temple.",
      "12": "People sinned there instead of offering the proper daily sacrifices, and true religion was thrown to the ground. The horn was successful in everything it did.",
      "13": "Then I heard one angel ask another, \"How long will these things that were seen in the vision continue? How long will an awful sin replace the daily sacrifices? How long will the army of heaven and the Temple be trampled on?\"",
      "14": "I heard the other angel answer, \"It will continue for 2,300 evenings and mornings, during which sacrifices will not be offered. Then the Temple will be restored.\"",
      "15": "I was trying to understand what the vision meant, when suddenly someone was standing in front of me.",
      "16": "I heard a voice call out over the Ulai River, \"Gabriel, explain to him the meaning of what he saw.\"",
      "17": "Gabriel came and stood beside me, and I was so terrified that I fell to the ground. He said to me, \"Mortal man, understand the meaning. The vision has to do with the end of the world.\"",
      "18": "While he was talking, I fell to the ground unconscious. But he took hold of me, raised me to my feet,",
      "19": "and said, \"I am showing you what the result of God's anger will be. The vision refers to the time of the end.",
      "20": "\"The ram you saw that had two horns represents the kingdoms of Media and Persia.",
      "21": "The goat represents the kingdom of Greece, and the prominent horn between his eyes is the first king.",
      "22": "The four horns that came up when the first horn was broken represent the four kingdoms into which that nation will be divided and which will not be as strong as the first kingdom.",
      "23": "\"When the end of those kingdoms is near and they have become so wicked that they must be punished, there will be a stubborn, vicious, and deceitful king.",
      "24": "He will grow strong--but not by his own power. He will cause terrible destruction and be successful in everything he does. He will bring destruction on powerful men and on God's own people.",
      "25": "Because he is cunning, he will succeed in his deceitful ways. He will be proud of himself and destroy many people without warning. He will even defy the greatest King of all, but he will be destroyed without the use of any human power.",
      "26": "This vision about the evening and morning sacrifices which has been explained to you will come true. But keep it secret now, because it will be a long time before it does come true.\"",
      "27": "I was depressed and ill for several days. Then I got up and went back to the work that the king had assigned to me, but I was puzzled by the vision and could not understand it."
