      "6": "So Amnon pretended that he was sick and went to bed. King David went to see him, and Amnon said to him, \"Please let Tamar come and make a few cakes here where I can see her, and then serve them to me herself.\"",
      "7": "So David sent word to Tamar in the palace: \"Go to Amnon's house and fix him some food.\"",
      "8": "She went there and found him in bed. She took some dough, prepared it, and made some cakes there where he could see her. Then she baked the cakes",

      "11": "As she offered them to him, he grabbed her and said, \"Come to bed with me!\"",

      "13": "How could I ever hold up my head in public again? And you--you would be completely disgraced in Israel. Please, speak to the king, and I'm sure that he will give me to you.\"",
      "14": "But he would not listen to her; and since he was stronger than she was, he overpowered her and raped her.",
      "15": "Then Amnon was filled with a deep hatred for her; he hated her now even more than he had loved her before. He said to her, \"Get out!\"",
      "16": "\"No,\" she answered. \"To send me away like this is a greater crime than what you just did!\" But Amnon would not listen to her;",
      "17": "he called in his personal servant and said, \"Get this woman out of my sight! Throw her out and lock the door!\"",

      "20": "When her brother Absalom saw her, he asked, \"Has Amnon molested you? Please, sister, don't let it upset you so much. He is your half brother, so don't tell anyone about it.\" So Tamar lived in Absalom's house, sad and lonely.",
      "21": "When King David heard what had happened, he was furious.",
      "22": "And Absalom hated Amnon so much for having raped his sister Tamar that he would no longer even speak to him.",

      "25": "\"No, my son,\" the king answered. \"It would be too much trouble for you if we all went.\" Absalom insisted, but the king would not give in, and he asked Absalom to leave.",
      "26": "But Absalom said, \"Well, then, will you at least let my brother Amnon come?\" \"Why should he?\" the king asked.",
      "27": "But Absalom kept on insisting until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king",
      "28": "and instructed his servants: \"Notice when Amnon has had too much to drink, and then when I give the order, kill him. Don't be afraid. I will take the responsibility myself. Be brave and don't hesitate!\"",
      "29": "So the servants followed Absalom's instructions and killed Amnon. All the rest of David's sons mounted their mules and fled.",
      "30": "While they were on their way home, David was told: \"Absalom has killed all your sons--not one of them is left!\"",
      "31": "The king stood up, tore his clothes in sorrow, and threw himself to the ground. The servants who were there with him tore their clothes also.",
      "32": "But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah, said, \"Your Majesty, they haven't killed all your sons. Only Amnon is dead. You could tell by looking at Absalom that he had made up his mind to do this from the time that Amnon raped his sister Tamar.",
      "33": "So don't believe the news that all your sons are dead; only Amnon was killed.\"",
      "34": "In the meantime Absalom had fled. Just then the soldier on sentry duty saw a large crowd coming down the hill on the road from Horonaim. He went to the king and reported what he had seen.",
      "35": "Jonadab said to David, \"Those are your sons coming, just as I said they would.\"",
      "36": "As soon as he finished saying this, David's sons came in; they started crying, and David and his officials also cried bitterly.",

      "5": "His wife Jezebel went to him and asked, \"Why are you so depressed? Why won't you eat?\"",
      "6": "He answered, \"Because of what Naboth said to me. I offered to buy his vineyard or, if he preferred, to give him another one for it, but he told me that I couldn't have it!\"",
      "7": "\"Well, are you the king or aren't you?\" Jezebel replied. \"Get out of bed, cheer up, and eat. I will get you Naboth's vineyard!\"",

      "26": "He committed the most shameful sins by worshiping idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD had driven out of the land as the people of Israel advanced.)",
      "27": "When Elijah finished speaking, Ahab tore his clothes, took them off, and put on sackcloth. He refused food, slept in the sackcloth, and went about gloomy and depressed.",
      "28": "The LORD said to the prophet Elijah,",
      "29": "\"Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Since he has done this, I will not bring disaster on him during his lifetime; it will be during his son's lifetime that I will bring disaster on Ahab's family.\""

      "29": "Elisha turned to Gehazi and said, \"Hurry! Take my walking stick and go. Don't stop to greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, don't take time to answer. Go straight to the house and hold my stick over the boy.\"",

      "41": "Elisha asked for some meal, threw it into the pot, and said, \"Pour out some more stew for them.\" And then there was nothing wrong with it.",
      "42": "Another time, a man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing Elisha twenty loaves of bread made from the first barley harvested that year, and some freshly-cut heads of grain. Elisha told his servant to feed the group of prophets with this,",
