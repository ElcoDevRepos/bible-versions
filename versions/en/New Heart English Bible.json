      "9": "Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.",
      "10": "David’s heart struck him after that he had numbered the people. David said to the LORD, \"I have sinned greatly in that which I have done. But now, LORD, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.\"",
      "11": "When David rose up in the morning, the word of the LORD came to Gad, David’s seer, saying,",
      "12": "\"Go and speak to David, ‘Thus says the LORD, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.'\"",
      "13": "So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, \"Shall three years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.\"",
      "14": "David said to Gad, \"All of them are difficult for me. Only let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great. Let me not fall into the hand of man.\"",
      "15": "So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time; and the destruction began among the people. And there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.",
      "16": "When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, \"It is enough. Now stay your hand.\" The angel of the LORD was standing near the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell down on their faces.",
      "17": "Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, \"Look, I have sinned, and I, the shepherd, have done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father’s house.\"",
      "18": "And Gad went to David that day and said, \"Go up, build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\"",
      "19": "So David went up and did what Gad had said, as the LORD commanded.",
      "20": "And Araunah looked out and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him, so Araunah went out and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.",
      "21": "And Araunah said, \"Why has my lord the king come to his servant?\" And David said, \"To buy this threshing floor from you to build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague may be held back from the people.\"",
      "22": "But Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Look, the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.",
      "23": "All these Araunah gives to the king.\" And Araunah said to the king, “May the LORD your God accept you.\"",
      "24": "But the king said to Araunah, \"No, but I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God which cost me nothing.\" So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.",
      "25": "Then David built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD responded to the plea for the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel."

      "1": "Now king David was old and advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn't keep warm.",
      "2": "Therefore his servants said to him, \"Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. And let her attend the king, and care for him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.\"",
      "3": "So they sought for a beautiful young woman throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.",
      "4": "The young woman was very beautiful; and she became the king's attendant and served him; but the king did not know her intimately.",
      "5": "Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, \"I will be king.\" So he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.",
      "6": "His father had never scolded him at any time by saying, \"Why have you done so?\" And he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom.",
      "7": "And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. And they followed Adonijah and helped him.",

      "9": "And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is near En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants:",
      "10": "but he did not invite Nathan the prophet, or Benaiah, or the mighty men, or his brother Solomon.",
      "11": "Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, \"Haven't you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn't know it?",
      "12": "Now therefore come, please let me give you advice, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.",
      "13": "Go in to king David, and tell him, 'Did you not, my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, \"Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne\"? Why then does Adonijah reign?'",
      "14": "And look, while you are still there speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.\"",
      "15": "Bathsheba went in to the king into the room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king.",
      "16": "Bathsheba bowed, and showed respect to the king. The king said, \"What would you like?\"",
      "17": "And she said to him, \"My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your handmaid, 'Assuredly Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne.'",
      "18": "Now, look, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, do not know it.",

      "22": "And look, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.",
      "23": "And they told the king, saying, \"Look, Nathan the prophet.\" And when he came in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.",
      "24": "And Nathan said, \"My lord, king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne?'",
      "25": "For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Look, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, 'Long live king Adonijah.'",
