      "10": "I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God. You must never fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you will live.' But you have not obeyed me.\"",
      "11": "The Messenger of the LORD came and sat under the oak tree in Ophrah that belonged to Joash from Abiezer's family. Joash's son Gideon was beating out wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.",
      "12": "The Messenger of the LORD appeared to Gideon and said, \"The LORD is with you, brave man.\"",
      "13": "Gideon responded, \"Excuse me, sir! But if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all the miracles our ancestors have told us about? Didn't they say, 'The LORD brought us out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and has handed us over to Midian.\"",
      "14": "The LORD turned to him and said, \"You will rescue Israel from Midian with the strength you have. I am sending you.\"",
      "15": "Gideon said to him, \"Excuse me, sir! How can I rescue Israel? Look at my whole family. It's the weakest one in Manasseh. And me? I'm the least important member of my family.\"",
      "16": "The LORD replied, \"I will be with you. You will defeat Midian as if it were [only] one man.\"",
      "17": "Gideon said to him, \"If you find me acceptable, give me a sign that it is really you speaking to me.",
      "18": "Don't leave until I come back. I want to bring my gift and set it in front of you.\" \"I will stay until you come back,\" he said.",
      "19": "Then Gideon went into [his house] and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread made with 18 quarts of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. then he went out and presented them to the messenger of the LORD under the oak tree.",
      "20": "The Messenger of the LORD told him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened bread, put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.\" Gideon did so.",
      "21": "Then the Messenger of the LORD touched the meat and the bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared up from the rock and burned the meat and the bread. Then the Messenger of the LORD disappeared.",
      "22": "That's when Gideon realized that this had been the Messenger of the LORD. So he said, \"LORD God! I have seen the Messenger of the LORD face to face.\"",
      "23": "The LORD said to him, \"Calm down! Don't be afraid. You will not die.\"",
      "24": "So Gideon built an altar there to the LORD. He called it The LORD Calms. To this day it is still in Ophrah, which belongs to Abiezer's family.",
      "25": "That same night the LORD said to Gideon, \"Take a bull from your father's herd, a bull that is seven years old. Tear down your father's altar dedicated to the god Baal and cut down the pole dedicated to the goddess Asherah that is next to it.",
      "26": "Then, in the proper way, build an altar to the LORD your God on top of this fortified place. Take this second bull and sacrifice it as a burnt offering on the wood from the Asherah pole that you have cut down.\"",
      "27": "Gideon took ten of his servants and did what the LORD had told him to do. However, he didn't do anything during the day. He was too afraid of his father's family and the men of the city, so he did it at night.",
      "28": "When the men of the city got up early in the morning, they saw that the Baal altar had been torn down. The Asherah pole next to it had also been cut down. They saw that the second bull had been sacrificed as a burnt offering on the altar that had been built.",
      "29": "They asked each other, \"Who did this?\" While they were investigating the matter, someone said, \"Gideon, son of Joash, did this.\"",
      "30": "Then the men of the city told Joash, \"Bring your son out. He must die. He has torn down the Baal altar and cut down the Asherah pole that was beside it.\"",
      "31": "But Joash said to everyone standing around him, \"You're not going to defend Baal, are you? Do you think you should save him? Whoever defends him will be put to death in the morning. If he's a god, let him defend himself when someone tears down his altar.\"",
      "32": "So that day they nicknamed Gideon \"Jerubbaal\" [Let Baal Defend Himself], because they said, \"When someone tears down Baal's altar, let Baal defend himself.\"",
      "33": "All of Midian, Amalek, and Kedem combined their armies, crossed [the Jordan River], and camped in the valley of Jezreel.",
      "34": "Then the LORD's Spirit gave Gideon strength. So Gideon blew the ram's horn to summon Abiezer's family to follow him.",
      "35": "He also sent messengers throughout Manasseh to summon the people to follow him. The tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali were also summoned to follow him, and they went to meet the enemy in battle.",
      "36": "Then Gideon said to God, \"You said that you would rescue Israel through me.",
      "37": "I'll place some wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the wool while all the ground is dry, then I'll know that you will rescue Israel through me, as you said.\"",
      "38": "And that is what happened. The next morning Gideon got up early. He squeezed out a bowl full of water from the wool.",
      "39": "Then Gideon said to God, \"Don't be angry with me. But let me ask one more thing. Let me make one more test with the wool. Let the wool be dry while all the ground is covered with dew.\"",
      "40": "During the night, God did what Gideon asked. The wool was dry, but all the ground was covered with dew."

      "1": "Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the troops with him got up early and camped above En Harod. Midian's camp was north of him at the hill of Moreh in the valley.",
      "2": "The LORD said to Gideon, \"You have too many men with you for me to hand Midian over to you. Israel might brag and say, 'We saved ourselves.'",
      "3": "Announce to the troops, 'Whoever is scared or frightened should leave Mount Gilead and go back home.' \" So 22,000 men went back home, and 10,000 were left.",
      "4": "The LORD said to Gideon, \"There are still too many men. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. If I say to you, 'This one will go with you,' he must go with you. And if I say to you, 'This one won't go with you,' he must not go.\"",
      "5": "So Gideon took the men down to the water. The LORD said to him, \"Separate those who lap water with their tongues like dogs from those who kneel down to drink.\"",
      "6": "Three hundred men lapped water with their hands to their mouths. All the rest of the men knelt down to drink water.",
      "7": "Then the LORD said to Gideon, \"With the 300 men who lapped water I will save you and hand Midian over to you. All the other men should go home.\"",
      "8": "So Gideon sent the other men of Israel home, but the 300 men who stayed kept all the supplies and rams' horns. The camp of Midian was below him in the valley.",
      "9": "That night the LORD said to Gideon, \"Attack! Go into the camp! I will hand it over to you.",
      "10": "But if you're afraid to go, take your servant Purah to the camp with you.",
      "11": "Listen to what people are saying. After that, you will have the courage to go into the camp and attack it.\" So Gideon and his servant Purah went to the edge of the camp.",
      "12": "Midian, Amalek, and all of Kedem were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts. There were so many camels that they could not be counted. They were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore.",
      "13": "When Gideon got there, he heard a man telling his friend a dream. The man said, \"I had a strange dream. There was a loaf of barley bread rolling around in the camp of Midian. When it got to the command post, the loaf of bread hit that tent so hard that the tent collapsed, turned upside down, and fell flat.\"",
      "14": "His friend replied, \"That can only be the sword of Gideon, son of Joash, from Israel. God is going to hand Midian and the whole camp over to him.\"",
      "15": "When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped the LORD. Then he went back to the camp of Israel and said, \"Attack! The LORD will hand Midian's camp over to you.\"",
      "16": "Gideon divided the 300 men into three companies. He gave them each rams' horns and jars with torches inside.",
      "17": "He said to them, \"Watch me, and do what I do. When I come to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.",
      "18": "When I and those with me blow our rams' horns, then the rest of you around the camp do the same and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon!'\"",
      "19": "Gideon and his 100 men came to the edge of the camp. It was the beginning of the midnight watch just at the change of the guards. They blew their rams' horns and smashed the jars they were holding in their hands.",

      "21": "While each man kept his position around the camp, everyone in the Midianite camp began to run away, screaming as they fled.",
      "22": "The 300 men kept on blowing their rams' horns, and the LORD caused the whole camp of Midian to fight among themselves. They fled as far as Beth Shittah, toward Zererah, and as far as the bank of the stream at Abel Meholah near Tabbath.",

      "4": "Gideon and his 300 men headed toward the Jordan River. They were exhausted when they crossed it, but they kept pursuing the enemy.",
