      "33": "Now therefore, do not let my lord the king take it to heart, as if all the king’s sons were dead; for Amnon alone is dead.”",

      "6": "Your servant had two sons, and they fought with one another in the field; there was no one to part them, and one struck the other and killed him.",
      "7": "Now the whole family has risen against your servant. They say, ‘Give up the man who struck his brother, so that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he murdered, even if we destroy the heir as well.’ Thus they would quench my one remaining ember, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.”",

      "16": "For the king will hear, and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would cut both me and my son off from the heritage of God.’",
      "17": "Your servant thought, ‘The word of my lord the king will set me at rest’; for my lord the king is like the angel of God, discerning good and evil. The LORD your God be with you!”",
      "18": "Then the king answered the woman, “Do not withhold from me anything I ask you.” The woman said, “Let my lord the king speak.”",
      "19": "The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” The woman answered and said, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn right or left from anything that my lord the king has said. For it was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.",
      "20": "In order to change the course of affairs your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth.”",

      "25": "Now in all Israel there was no one to be praised so much for his beauty as Absalom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.",

      "27": "There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a beautiful woman.",
