      "19": "When she had finished giving him a drink, she also said, \"I'll also draw water for your camels until they've had enough to drink.\"",
      "20": "She quickly emptied her jug into the trough and ran to the well to draw again until she had drawn enough water for all ten of the servant's camels.",
      "21": "The man stared at her in silence, waiting to see whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.",
      "22": "When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a half shekel and two bracelets for her wrists, weighing 10 shekels and presented them to her.",
      "23": "He asked her, \"Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?\"",
      "24": "\"I am the daughter of Bethuel,\" she answered. \"He's the son of Milcah and Nahor.",

      "30": "And so it was, as soon as he saw the nose ring and bracelets on his sister's wrists, and as soon as he heard what his sister Rebekah was saying about what the man had spoken to her, he went out to the man who was still standing by the camels at the spring!",
      "31": "\"Come on,\" Laban said. \"The LORD has blessed you! So why are you standing out here when I've prepared some space in the house and a place for the camels?\"",
      "32": "So the servant went to the house and unbridled the camels. They provided straw and feed for the camels and water for washing his feet and those of the men with him.",
      "33": "But when they had prepared a meal and set it in front of him, he said, \"I'm not eating until I've spoken.\" \"Speak up!\" Laban exclaimed.",

      "42": "\"So today I arrived at the spring and prayed, 'LORD God of my master Abraham, if you wish to make the journey that I have traveled successful,",

      "45": "\"Before I had finished praying, along came Rebekah with her jug on her shoulder! She went to the spring and drew some water. I asked her to please let me have a drink.",

      "49": "So now, if you wish to show gracious love and truth toward my master, tell me so. But if not, tell me, so that I may go elsewhere.\"",
      "50": "\"Since this has come from the LORD,\" Laban and Bethuel both replied, \"we cannot speak one way or another.",
      "51": "So here's Rebekah—she's right in front of you. Take her and go, so she can become a wife for your master's son, just as the LORD has decreed.\"",
      "52": "When Abraham's servant heard what they had said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.",
      "53": "Then the servant brought out some silver and gold items, along with some clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave gifts to her brother and to her mother.",

      "57": "But they said, \"We'll call the young lady and see what she has to say about this.\"",
      "58": "So they called Rebekah and asked her, \"Do you want to go with this man?\" \"I will go,\" she replied.",

      "60": "As they were leaving, they all blessed Rebekah by saying, \"Our sister, may you become the mother of tens of millions! May your descendants take over the city gates of those who hate them.\"",
      "61": "Then Rebekah and her young servant women got up, mounted their camels, and followed Abraham's servant, who took Rebekah and went on his way.",

      "26": "Whenever he cut his hair —he cut it at the end of every year, because it grew thick on his head, which is why he cut it—his hair weighed in at 200 shekels measured by the royal standard.",
      "27": "Absalom fathered three sons and one daughter, whom he named Tamar. She was a beautiful woman, both in form and appearance.",
      "28": "Meanwhile, Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years, but never saw the king's face.",
      "29": "After this, Absalom sent for Joab, intending to send him to the king, but Joab would not come. Absalom sent for him a second time, but he still would not come.",
      "30": "So Absalom told his servants, \"Observe that Joab's grain field lies next to mine. He has barley planted there. Go set it on fire.\" So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.",
      "31": "At this, Joab got up, went to Absalom's home, and demanded of him, \"Why did your servants set fire to my grain field?\"",
      "32": "In answer to Joab, Absalom replied, \"Look, I sent for you, telling you 'Come here so I can send you to the king to ask him \"What's the point in moving here from Geshur? I would have been better off to have remained there!\"' So let me see the king's face, and if I'm guilty of anything, let him execute me!\"",
      "33": "So when Joab approached the king and told him what Absalom had said, he summoned Absalom, who then came to the king and fell to the ground on his face in front of him. Then the king kissed Absalom."
    },
    "15": {
      "1": "Sometime later, Absalom acquired a chariot equipped with horses and recruited 50 men to accompany him.",
      "2": "Then he would get up early, stand near the passageway to the palace gate, and when anyone arrived to file a legal complaint for a hearing before the king, Absalom would call to him and ask, \"You're from what city?\" If he replied, \"Your servant is from one of Israel's tribes,\"",
      "3": "Absalom would respond, \"Look, your claims are valid and defensible, but nobody will listen to you on behalf of the king.",
      "4": "Who will appoint me to be a judge in the land? When anyone arrived to file a legal complaint or other cause, he could approach me for justice and I would settle it!\"",
      "5": "Furthermore, if a man approached him to bow down in front of him, he would put out his hand, grab him, and embrace him.",
      "6": "By doing all of this to anyone who came to the king for a hearing, Absalom stole the loyalty of the men of Israel.",
      "7": "And so it was that forty years after Israel had demanded a king, Absalom asked the king, \"Please let me go to Hebron so I can pay my vow that I made to the LORD,",
      "8": "because when I was living at Geshur in Aram, your servant made this solemn promise: 'If the LORD ever brings me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.'\"",
      "9": "The king replied to him, \"Go in peace!\" So Absalom got up and left for Hebron.",
      "10": "But Absalom sent agents throughout all of the tribes of Israel, telling them, \"When you hear the sound of the battle trumpet, you're to announce that Absalom is king in Hebron.\"",
      "11": "Meanwhile, 200 men left Jerusalem with Absalom. They had been invited to go along, but were innocent, not knowing anything about what was happening.",
      "12": "Absalom also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, to come from his home town of Giloh while Absalom was presenting the sacrificial offerings. And so the conspiracy widened, because the common people increasingly sided with Absalom.",
      "13": "Then a messenger arrived to inform David, \"The loyalties of the men of Israel have shifted to Absalom.\"",
      "14": "So David told all of his staff who were with him in Jerusalem, \"Let's get up and get out of here! Otherwise, none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry, or he'll overtake us quickly, bring disaster on all of us, and execute the inhabitants of the city!\"",
      "15": "\"Look!\" the king's staff replied. \"Your servants will do whatever the king chooses.\"",
      "16": "So the king left, taking his entire household with him except for ten mistresses, who were to keep the palace in order.",
      "17": "The king left, along with all of his people with him, and they paused at the last house.",
      "18": "All of his staff were going on ahead of him—that is, all of the special forces and mercenaries, all of the Gittites, and 600 men who had come to serve him from Gath, went on ahead of the king.",
      "19": "Then the king suggested to Ittai the Gittite, \"Why should you have to go with us? Return and stay with the new king, since you're a foreigner and exile. Stay where you want to stay.",
      "20": "It seems only yesterday that you arrived, so should I make you wander around with us while I go wherever I can? Go back, and take your brothers with you. May gracious love and truth accompany you!\"",
      "21": "\"As the LORD lives,\" Ittai answered in reply, \"and as your majesty the king lives, wherever your majesty my king may be—whether living or dying—that's where your servant will be!\"",
      "22": "So David replied, \"Come along, then!\" So Ittai the Gittite went along also, accompanied by all of his men and all of his little ones.",
      "23": "With all of the people in the territory crying loudly, everybody passed over the Kidron brook, along with the king. Then everyone headed out toward the road that leads to the wilderness.",
      "24": "Meanwhile, Zadok showed up also, along with all of the descendants of Levi with him, carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark of God and Abiathar approached while all the people finished abandoning the city.",
      "25": "The king told Zadok, \"Take the Ark of God back to the city. If I'm shown favor in the LORD's sight, then he'll bring me back again and show me both it and the place where it rests.",
      "26": "But if he should say something like 'I'm not pleased with you,' well then, here I am—let him do to me whatever seems right to him.\"",
      "27": "The king also asked Zadok the priest, \"Aren't you a seer, too? Go back to the city in comfort, along with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan.",
      "28": "Look! I'll camp at the wilderness fords until you send word to inform me.\"",
      "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar returned the Ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there.",
      "30": "David then left, going up the Mount of Olives, crying as he went, with his head covered and his feet bare. All of the people who were with him covered their own heads and climbed up the Mount of Olives, crying as they went along.",
      "31": "Just then, someone told David, \"Ahithophel is one of Absalom's conspirators!\" So David prayed, \"LORD, please turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness.\"",
      "32": "Just as David was coming to the top of the Mount of Olives where God was being worshipped, there was Hushai the Archite to meet him, with his coat ripped and dust all over his head!",
      "33": "David greeted him, \"If you come along with me, you'll be a burden to me.",
      "34": "So go back to the city and tell Absalom, 'I'll be your servant, your majesty! Just as I served your father in the past, I can be your servant now.' That way you can manipulate Ahithophel's advice to my benefit.",
      "35": "Won't Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you? So whatever you hear from the king's palace, you're to report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",
      "36": "Their two sons—Zadok's son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan—are with them there. You'll be sending me everything that you hear through them.\"",
      "37": "So David's friend Hushai went back to the city just as Absalom was arriving in Jerusalem."
    },
    "16": {
      "1": "Now just as David happened to have passed the summit of the Mount of Olives, suddenly Mephibosheth's servant Ziba met him, accompanied by a couple of saddled donkeys loaded with 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 pieces of summer fruit, and a skin of wine!",
      "2": "The king asked Ziba, \"What are those for?\" Ziba replied, \"The donkeys are for the king's household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for your young men to eat, and the wine is for whoever wants to drink if they get weary in the wilderness.\"",
      "3": "Then the king asked, \"Where is your master's son?\" \"He's staying in Jerusalem!\" Ziba answered the king. \"He's saying 'The nation of Israel will restore my father's kingdom to me today!'\"",
      "4": "So the king told Ziba, \"Pay attention! Everything that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!\" In response Ziba said, \"I'm submitting to you. Let me find favor in your sight, your majesty the king!\"",
      "5": "Later on, as King David approached Bahurim, Gera's son Shimei, who was related to the family of Saul's household, went out to meet David, cursing continually as he approached.",
      "6": "He threw rocks at David and all of David's staff who were accompanying him, while all the rest of the entourage, including all of David's security detail, were close by him.",
      "7": "\"Get out of here! Get out!\" Shimei yelled as he cursed. \"You murderer! You who think you're above the law!",
      "8": "The LORD has repaid you personally for murdering the entire dynasty of Saul, whose place you've taken to reign! And the LORD has given the kingdom into your son Absalom's control. Now look! Your own evil has caught up with you, because you're guilty of murder!\"",
      "9": "At this point, Zeruiah's son Abishai asked the king, \"Why should this dead dog be cursing your majesty the king? May I have permission to go over and cut off his head?\"",
      "10": "But the king responded, \"What do I have in common with you sons of Zeruiah? If he continues to curse—and if the LORD has told him, 'Curse David!'—then who are you to be demanding to know 'Why have you done this?'\"",
      "11": "So David ordered Abishai and all of his staff: \"Look! My own son wants to kill me! How much more now is this descendant of Benjamin? Leave him alone and let him go on cursing, because the LORD has ordered him to do this.",
      "12": "Perhaps the LORD will take note of my troubles and return good to me instead of curses today!\"",
      "13": "So David and his entourage went on their way, and Shimei walked along the hillside with him, cursing, throwing rocks, and tossing dirt at David as they went along.",
      "14": "Eventually, the king and his entourage arrived exhausted at their destination, and David refreshed himself there.",
      "15": "Right about then, Absalom and his entourage from the people of Israel entered Jerusalem, accompanied by Ahithophel.",
      "16": "When David's friend Hushai the Archite approached Absalom, Hushai greeted Absalom, \"Long live the king! Long live the king!\"",
      "17": "But Absalom asked Hushai, \"So this is how you demonstrate your loyalty to your closest friends? Why didn't you leave with your friend?\"",
      "18": "Hushai replied, \"No! On the contrary, whomever the LORD, this group, and all the men of Israel choose is where I'll be, and I'll remain with him!",
      "19": "Besides, who else should I be serving? Why not the son? The same way I served your father, I'll serve you.\"",
      "20": "So Absalom asked Ahithophel, \"What's your advice? What should we do?\"",
      "21": "Ahithophel responded, \"Go inside and have sex with your father's mistresses , whom he left to keep the palace in order. Then everyone in Israel will hear how your father has come to hate you and everyone who has joined you will be emboldened to act.\"",
      "22": "So they erected a tent for Absalom on the palace roof and Absalom went in and had sex with his father's mistresses right in front of all Israel.",
      "23": "Now Ahithophel's advice that he provided at that time was being compared to one who inquired of God, so highly regarded was Ahithophel's counsel by both David and Absalom."
    },
    "17": {
      "1": "\"Give me 12,000 men! I'll leave tonight and pursue David,\" Ahithophel advised Absalom.",
      "2": "\"I'll catch him while he is still tired and weak. I'll frighten him so all his people with him desert him. But I'll only kill the king.",
      "3": "Then I'll bring everybody else back to you. When the man you're looking for is dead, all the rest of the people will return quietly.\"",
      "4": "Even though this plan seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all of the elders of Israel,",
      "5": "Absalom replied, \"Call in Hushai the Archite so I can hear what he has to say, too!\"",
      "6": "When Hushai approached Absalom, Absalom asked him, \"Here's what Ahithophel had to advise. Should we do what he says? Or if not, say so!\"",
      "7": "\"Ahithophel's advice is not best at this time,\" Hushai suggested to Absalom.",
      "8": "\"You know how strong your father and his men are. They're as mad as a bear robbed of her cubs! Furthermore, your father is a skilled warrior. He won't stay with his army at night.",
      "9": "Look! He's probably already hiding in a cave or someplace like that. If the first attack fails, people will hear about it and think, 'Absalom's army is losing!'",
      "10": "Then even men who would otherwise be as brave as lions will be scared, because every Israeli knows your father is a mighty man, and they know his men are valiant!",
      "11": "So here's my advice: Muster everybody from one end of the country to the other! You'll have an army in number like the sand on the seashore! Then you'll go into battle!",
      "12": "We'll go find David wherever he's hiding. We'll fall on him like dew on the ground! We'll kill him and all of his men, and we won't leave even one man alive!",
      "13": "If he escapes into a city, we'll bring ropes to that city and tear it down! We won't leave a single stone left in the valley!\"",
      "14": "Absalom and all of the Israelis replied, \"The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than Ahithophel's!\" But the LORD had planned to circumvent the sound advice of Ahithophel so the LORD could bring Absalom to destruction.",
      "15": "So Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, what Ahithophel had suggested to Absalom and the elders of Israel. He also reported what he himself had proposed. Hushai said,",
      "16": "\"Quick! Get word to David! Tell him not to spend the night at the crossings that lead to the desert. Instead, he must cross the Jordan River immediately. That way, if he crosses the river, the king and his entourage will survive.\"",
      "17": "Meanwhile, since they could not risk being seen entering the city, Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been waiting at En-rogel, where a young servant woman was to go to inform them and they would then go brief King David.",
      "18": "But a young man observed Jonathan and Ahimaaz and informed Absalom, so they left in a hurry, arrived at the home of a man who lived at Bahurim, and hid inside a well that was in his courtyard.",
      "19": "The man's wife grabbed a sheet, covered the mouth of the well with it, and spread some dried grain over it. As a result, nobody could tell it was a hiding place.",
      "20": "When Absalom's servants approached the woman of the house, they asked her, \"Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?\" \"They've already crossed the brook,\" the woman answered. So Absalom's servants went away in search of Jonathan and Ahimaaz, but they couldn't find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.",
      "21": "A little while later, the men crawled up out of the well and went off to talk to King David. They told David, \"Get up! Cross the water quickly, because this is what Ahithophel advised about you…\"",
      "22": "So David got up and all of his entourage crossed the Jordan River. Everyone had crossed the Jordan River by dawn's first light.",
      "23": "Meanwhile, when Ahithophel observed that his counsel was not being acted upon, he saddled his donkey, got up, and left for his hometown. Leaving behind a set of orders for his household, he hanged himself. After his death he was buried in his father's tomb.",
      "24": "Later, David arrived at Mahanaim. Absalom and all of the Israelis who supported him crossed the Jordan River.",
      "25": "Absalom had installed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. (Amasa was the son of a man named Jether the Ishmaelite. His mother was Abigail, a daughter of Nahash and a sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.)",
      "26": "Absalom and the Israelis with him camped in the territory of Gilead.",
      "27": "When David arrived at Mahanaim, Shobi (Nahash's son from the Ammonite town of Rabbah), Makir (Ammiel's son from Lo-debar), and Barzillai (from Rogelim in Gilead) were already there.",
      "28": "They brought along bedding, bowls, clay basins, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grains, beans, peas,",
      "29": "honey, cheeses, sheep, and cheese made from cow's milk for David and his entourage because they had been reasoning, \"The people are hungry, tired, and thirsty there in the wilderness.\""
    },
    "18": {
      "1": "David mustered his forces and appointed officers in charge of regiments and companies.",
      "2": "Dividing his forces into three groups, he set Joab as commander of one third of his army, Zeruiah's son Abishai, Joab's brother, as commander of another third, and Ittai from Gath as commander of another third. The king informed the army, \"I'm going out to battle with you, too.\"",
      "3": "\"No way!\" his army responded. \"If we have to retreat from the battle, Absalom's men won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care about us. But you are worth 10,000 of us. The best thing you can do for us is to remain in the city.\"",
      "4": "So David responded, \"I'll do what you think best.\" Then he stood alongside the city gate as the army went out in battle array by hundreds and thousands.",
      "5": "As they were going out, the king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, \"Treat young Absalom gently for my sake.\" Everyone heard what the king had ordered his commanders about Absalom.",
      "6": "David's army left for the battlefield to fight Absalom and his Israeli followers, and they also fought in the Ephraim forest,",
      "7": "where David's army of servants defeated the Israelis. Many died that day—20,000 men.",
      "8": "The battle spread throughout the entire countryside, and the forest claimed more casualties that day than did the sword fighting.",
      "9": "Absalom happened to run into David's soldiers. While Absalom was trying to get away on his mule, it ran under the thick branches of a giant oak tree, and Absalom's head got caught in the tree! As his mule ran out from under him, Absalom was left hanging above the ground.",
      "10": "When one of the soldiers saw what had happened, he told Joab, \"I saw Absalom stuck in an oak tree!\"",
      "11": "Joab asked the man who was reporting to him, \"What! You saw him? Why didn't you kill him right then and there? I would've given you ten pieces of silver and a warrior's sash!\"",
      "12": "But the soldier replied to Joab, \"I wouldn't have touched the king's son even if you dropped 1,000 pieces of silver right into my hands, because we heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, 'Watch how you treat the young man Absalom!'",
      "13": "If I had taken his life, the king would have uncovered everything about it, and you would never have protected me!\"",
      "14": "\"There's no reason to wait for you!\" Joab retorted. Then he took three spears in his hand and stabbed Absalom in the heart while he was still alive, dangling from the branches of the oak tree.",
      "15": "Ten young men who served as Joab's personal assistants then surrounded Absalom, striking him repeatedly and killing him.",
      "16": "At this, Joab sounded his battle trumpet and his troops stopped pursuing the other Israelis.",
      "17": "Meanwhile, Joab's army grabbed Absalom's body, tossed it into a large pit in the forest, and filled it up with a huge pile of rocks. Then the Israelis ran away back to their homes.",
      "18": "While Absalom had been living, he had erected a pillar as a monument to himself in King's Valley because he had been telling himself, \"I don't have a son to carry on my family name.\" So he named the pillar after himself—it's called Absalom's Monument even today.",
      "19": "Zadok's son Ahimaaz told Joab, \"Let me run over to King David and take him the news. I'll mention that the LORD has delivered him from his enemies.\"",
      "20": "But Joab answered Ahimaaz, \"You're not the man to deliver news today. Do it any other time, but not today, because the king's son is dead.\"",
      "21": "So Joab ordered a man from Ethiopia, \"Go tell the king what you've seen.\" So the Ethiopian saluted Joab and then ran to tell David.",
      "22": "\"Please,\" Zadok's son Ahimaaz continued, \"No matter what happens, let me follow the Ethiopian!\" Joab asked him, \"Why this request to run, my son? There's no reward in it for you.\"",
      "23": "\"No matter what, I'm running,\" Ahimaaz replied. So Joab told Ahimaaz, \"Run!\" And Ahimaaz ran, taking the Jordan Valley road, passing the Ethiopian.",
      "24": "Meanwhile, David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the city. The watchman was up on the roof of the gateway near the walls, looking around, and there was a man running by himself!",
      "25": "So the watchman called out his news to the king. The king responded, \"If he's alone, he's bringing some news to report.\" As the man continued to draw near and approach the palace,",
      "26": "the watchman observed another man running. So he called out to the gatekeeper, \"There's another man running by himself!\" The king replied, \"He's also bringing some news to report!\"",
      "27": "Then the watchman observed, \"It looks to me that the runner out in front is running like Zadok's son Ahimaaz!\" The king replied, \"This is a good man bearing good news!\"",
      "28": "\"Everything's fine!\" Ahimaaz announced to the king. He bowed low with his face to the ground before the king and said, \"Praise be to the LORD your God! He has handed over the men who rebelled against your majesty the king.\"",
      "29": "\"Are things fine with respect to the young man Absalom?\" the king asked. Ahimaaz answered, \"I saw a lot of confusion about the time Joab was getting ready to send the king's courier and me, your servant, but I'm not sure what was going on.\"",
      "30": "The king replied, \"Stand here at attention and wait.\" So he stepped to the side and stood there waiting.",
      "31": "Just then the Ethiopian arrived. He reported, \"Good news, your majesty the king! The LORD has delivered you from the control of everyone who rebelled against you!\"",
      "32": "The king asked the Ethiopian, \"Is the young man safe?\" The Ethiopian answered, \"May the enemies of your majesty the king—including everyone who rebels and tries to harm you—become like that young man….\"",
      "33": "Deeply shaken, the king went up to the chamber overlooking the city gate, weeping bitterly and crying out as he went along, \"My son Absalom! My son! My son Absalom! I wish I had died instead of you, Absalom my son, my son!\""

    "19": {
      "1": "Someone informed Joab, \"The king is weeping bitterly, mourning for Absalom.\"",
      "2": "The victory had become an occasion for the army to mourn, because on that very day the troops heard the announcement, \"The king is grieving for his son!\"",

      "4": "Meanwhile, the king veiled his face and kept on crying loudly, \"My son Absalom! Absalom my son, my son!\"",
      "5": "Joab went up to the palace and rebuked the king: \"Today you've humiliated your entire army who just saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, and the lives of your wives and mistresses!",
      "6": "You love those who hate you and hate those who love you! You've made it abundantly clear today that your officers and the men under them mean nothing to you! I've learned today that you would rather have Absalom alive today and all the rest of us dead!",
      "7": "Now get up and restore the morale of your army. I swear by the LORD that if you don't get out there, you won't have a single man left in your army by nightfall! You'll be in more trouble today than all the disasters you've been through from your boyhood until now!\"",
      "8": "So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the army was informed, \"The king is sitting in the gateway!\" they all gathered together in his presence. Meanwhile, the Israelis had run away back to their own homes.",
      "9": "Throughout the tribes of Israel, everyone was quarreling with one another: \"The king delivered us from the domination of our enemies….\" \"He's the one who rescued us from Philistine control….\" \"Now he's fleeing the country because of Absalom…!\"",
      "10": "\"The very same Absalom we anointed to rule just died in battle…!\" \"Now then, why remain silent about bringing the king back…?\"",
      "11": "So King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: \"Ask the elders of Judah, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace, considering that what's being reported throughout all of Israel has come to the king at his palace?",
      "12": "You're my relatives! You're my own flesh and blood! So why are you the last to bring back the king?'",
      "13": "Then ask Amasa, 'Aren't you my own flesh and blood? So may God deal with me, no matter how severely, if from this day forward you don't take Joab's place as commander of my army.'",
      "14": "By doing things like this, he persuaded all the men of Judah to unite in support of him. They sent the king this message: \"Come on back, you and all of your army!\"",
      "15": "So the king returned to Israel as far as the Jordan River. The men of Judah went out as far as Gilgal to greet the king and escort him across the Jordan River",

      "17": "Ziba, the steward in charge of Saul's household, and 1,000 descendants of Benjamin accompanied him, along with Ziba's fifteen sons and 20 servants. They rushed toward the Jordan River ahead of the king",
      "18": "and forded it to assist the king at the crossing so he could do whatever he wished. Just as the king was about to ford the Jordan River, Gera's son Shimei fell down in front of the king",
      "19": "and addressed him, \"May your majesty not hold me guilty. Don't remember how your servant did wrong the day your majesty the king left Jerusalem. May the king not let it burden his heart,",

      "3": "Now there happened to be four lepers who were at that very moment at the entrance to the city gate. As they were talking with one another, they said, \"Why are we sitting here waiting to die?",
      "4": "If we tell ourselves, 'Let's remain in the city,' we'll die there since there's famine in the city. But if we sit here, we'll die, too. So let's go over to the Arameans! If they spare our lives, we'll live, and if they kill us…we're dying anyway!\"",

      "8": "When the lepers arrived at the outskirts of the encampment, they entered one tent and ate and drank. Then they carried off from there some silver, gold, and clothes, and went out and hid them. After this, they returned, entered another tent, raided it, and went and hid all of that, too!",
      "9": "But then they told each other, \"We're not doing the right thing. This is a day of good news, but if we keep quiet until morning, we're sure to be punished! So let's leave and go tell the king's household!\"",
      "10": "So they left, called out to the city gatekeepers, and reported to them: \"We went out to the Aramean encampment, and there was nobody there! Not even the sound of men—only horses and donkeys tied up, and tents left just as they were!\"",

      "17": "Meanwhile, the king appointed the same royal attendant on whom he depended to take control of the city gate, but the people trampled him to death in the gate, just as the man of God had told the king when the king came down to him.",

      "11": "Then Elisha looked steadily at Hazael until Hazael grew ashamed, and then the man of God began to cry.",
      "12": "\"Why are you crying, sir?\" Hazael asked. \"Because I know the evil that you're about to bring on the Israelis,\" he replied. \"You'll burn down their fortified cities, execute their young men with swords, dash to pieces their little ones, and you'll tear open their pregnant women!\"",

      "35": "Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken in pieces together and became like chaff from a summer threshing floor that the breeze carries away without leaving a trace. Then the rock that struck the statue grew into a huge mountain and filled the entire earth.",
      "36": "\"This was the dream, and we'll now relate its meaning to the king.",

      "39": "\"After you, another kingdom will arise that is inferior to yours, and then a third kingdom of bronze will arise to rule all the earth.",

      "42": "Just as their toes and feet are part iron and part clay, so will the kingdom be both strong and brittle.",
      "43": "Just as you saw iron mixed with clay, so they will mix themselves with human offspring. Furthermore, they won't remain together, just as iron doesn't mix with clay.",
      "44": "\"During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor its sovereignty left in the hands of another people. It will shatter and crush all of these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.",
      "45": "Now, just as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without human hands—and that it crushed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold to pieces—so also the great God has revealed to the king what will take place after this. Your dream will come true, and its meaning will prove trustworthy.\"",

      "3": "Daniel distinguished himself among all the administrators and regional authorities, because he was of an extraordinary spirit. Therefore the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom.",
      "4": "Because of this, the administrators and regional authorities tried to bring allegations of dereliction of duty in government affairs against Daniel, but they were unable to find any charges of corruption. Daniel was trustworthy, and no evidence of negligence or corruption could be found against him.",
      "5": "So these men said, \"We'll never find any basis for complaint against Daniel unless we build it on the requirements of his God.\"",

      "11": "The conspirators then went as a group and found Daniel praying and seeking help before his God.",
      "12": "So they approached the king and asked, \"Didn't you sign an edict that for the next 30 days if anyone prays to any god or man, except to you, your majesty, he would be thrown into the lions' pit?\" The king responded, \"The decree has been established, in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians that can't be repealed.\"",

      "22": "My God sent his angel and sealed the mouths of the lions. They have not harmed me, proving that I'm innocent before him. Also against you, your majesty, I've committed no offense.\"",
      "23": "The king was ecstatic, so he gave orders for Daniel to be released from the pit. Daniel was taken up from the pit, and no injury was found to have been inflicted on him, because he had believed in his God.",
      "24": "Then the king gave orders to bring those men who had tried to have Daniel devoured, and they threw them, their children, and their wives into the lions' pit. They had not reached the floor of the pit before the lions had overtaken them and crushed all their bones.",

      "3": "Four magnificent animals were rising from the sea, each different from the other.",
      "4": "The first resembled a lion, but it had eagles' wings. I continued to watch until its wings were plucked off, it was lifted up off the ground, and it was forced to stand on two feet like a man. A human soul was imparted to it.",
      "5": "\"Then look!—a second animal resembling a bear followed it. It was raised up on one side, with three ribs held between the teeth in its mouth. Therefore people kept telling it, 'Get up and devour lots of meat!'",
      "6": "\"After this, I continued to watch—and look!—there was another one, resembling a leopard with four birds' wings on its back. The animal also had four heads, and authority was imparted to it.",
      "7": "\"After this, I continued to observe the night visions. And look!—there was a fourth awe-inspiring, terrifying, and viciously strong animal! It had large, iron teeth. It devoured and crushed things, and trampled under its feet whatever remained. Different from all of the other previous animals, it had ten horns.",
      "8": "\"While I was thinking about the horns—look—another horn, this time a little one, grew up among them. Three of the first horns were yanked up by their roots right in front of it. Look! It had eyes like those of a human being and a mouth that boasted with audacious claims.\"",
      "9": "\"I kept on watching until the Ancient of Days was seated. His clothes were white, like snow, and the hair on his head was like pure wool. His throne burned with flaming fire, and its wheels burned with fire.",
      "10": "A river of fire flowed out from before him. Thousands upon thousands were serving him, with millions upon millions waiting before him. The court sat in judgment, and record books were unsealed.",
      "11": "\"I continued watching because of the audacious words that the horn was speaking. I kept observing until the animal was killed and its body destroyed and given over to burning fire.",
      "12": "Now as to the other animals, their authority was removed, but they were granted a reprieve from execution for an appointed period of time.\"",
      "13": "\"I continued to observe the night vision—and look!—someone like the Son of Man was coming, accompanied by heavenly clouds. He approached the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.",
      "14": "To him dominion was bestowed, along with glory and a kingdom, so that all peoples, nations, and languages are to serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion—it will never pass away—and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.\"",
      "15": "\"Now as for me, Daniel, I was emotionally troubled, and what I had seen in the visions kept alarming me.",
      "16": "So I approached one of those who was standing nearby and began to ask the meaning of all of this. He spoke to me and caused me to understand the interpretation of these things.",
      "17": "He said, 'These four great animals are four kings who will rise to power from the earth.",
      "18": "But the saints of the Highest will receive the kingdom forever, inheriting it forever and ever.'",
      "19": "\"I wanted to learn the precise significance of the fourth animal that was different from all the others, extremely awe-inspiring, with iron teeth and bronze claws, and that had devoured and crushed things, trampling under its feet whatever remained.",
      "20": "Also, I wanted to learn the significance of the ten horns on its head and the other horn that had arisen, before which three of them had fallen—that is, the horn with eyes and a mouth that uttered magnificent things and which was greater in appearance than its fellows.",
      "21": "\"As I continued to watch, that same horn waged war against the saints, and was prevailing against them",
      "22": "until the Ancient of Days arrived to pass judgment in favor of the saints of the Highest One and the time came for the saints to take possession of the kingdom.",
      "23": "So he said: 'The fourth animal will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, different from all the kingdoms. It will devour the entire earth, trampling it down and crushing it.",
      "24": "Now as to the ten horns, ten kings will rise to power from this kingdom, and another king will rise to power after them. He will be different from the previous kings, and will defeat three kings.",
      "25": "He'll speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One. He'll attempt to alter times and laws, and they'll be given into his control for a time, times, and half a time.",
      "26": "Nevertheless, the court will convene, and his authority will be removed, annulled, and destroyed forever.",

      "3": "\"Then I turned my head to look, and to my surprise, a two-horned ram was standing beside the canal. The two horns grew long, the first one growing longer than the second, with the longer one springing up last.",
      "4": "I watched the ram charging westward, northward, and southward. No animal could stand before him, nor was there anyone who could deliver from his control. He did as he pleased and exalted himself.",
      "5": "\"As I watched and wondered, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground. The goat had a distinctive horn between its eyes.",
      "6": "It approached the ram with the two horns that I had observed while standing beside the canal, and charged at him, out of control with rage.",
      "7": "I saw it approach the ram, overflowing with fury at him, and run into him with the full force of its strength. The goat shattered the ram's two horns, and the ram could not oppose it. So the goat threw him to the ground and trampled him. No one could rescue the ram from its control.",
      "8": "Then the goat grew extremely great, but when it was strong, its great horn was shattered. In its place, four distinctive horns grew out in all directions.\"",
      "9": "\"A somewhat insignificant horn emerged from one of them. It moved rapidly against the south, against the east, and against the Glory.",
      "10": "Then it moved against the Heavenly Army. It persuaded some of the Heavenly Army to fall to the earth, along with some of the stars, and it trampled them.",
      "11": "Then it set itself in arrogant opposition to the Prince of the Heavenly Army, from whom the regular burnt offering was taken away, in order to overthrow his sanctuary.",
      "12": "Because of the transgression, the Heavenly Army will be given over, along with the regular burnt offering, and in that rebellion truth will be cast to the ground, while he continues to prosper and to act.\"",

      "14": "\"He told me, 'For 2,300 days. Then the Holy Place will be restored.'\"",
      "15": "\"After I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I tried to understand it. All of a sudden, there was standing in front of me one who appeared to be valiant.",
      "16": "I heard the voice of a man calling out from the Ulai Canal, 'Gabriel, interpret what that fellow has been seeing.'",
      "17": "\"As he approached where I was standing, I became terrified and fell on my face. But he told me, 'Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end.'",
      "18": "\"While he had been speaking with me, I had fainted on my face, but he touched me and enabled me to stand upright on my feet.",
      "19": "Then he said, 'Pay attention! I'm going to brief you about what will happen at the end of the period of wrath, because its end is appointed.",

      "22": "The shattered horn and the four that took its place are four kingdoms that will come from his nation, but they will not have his strength.",
      "23": "\"Toward the end of their rule, as the desecrations proceed, an insolent king will arise, proficient at deception.",
      "24": "Mighty will be his skills, but not from his own abilities. He'll be remarkably destructive, will succeed, and will do whatever he wants, destroying mighty men and the holy people.",
      "25": "Through his skill he'll cause deceit to prosper under his leadership. He'll promote himself and will destroy many while they are secure. He'll take a stand against the Prince of Princes, yet he'll be crushed without human help.",
      "26": "The vision about the twilights and dawnings that has been related is trustworthy, but keep its vision secret, because it pertains to the distant future.'",
