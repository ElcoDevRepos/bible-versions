      "18": "\"Drink, sir!\" she replied as she quickly lowered her jug on her arm to offer him a drink.",
      "19": "When she had finished giving him a drink, she also said, \"I'll also draw water for your camels until they've had enough to drink.\"",
      "20": "She quickly emptied her jug into the trough and ran to the well to draw again until she had drawn enough water for all ten of the servant's camels.",
      "21": "The man stared at her in silence, waiting to see whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.",
      "22": "When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a half shekel and two bracelets for her wrists, weighing 10 shekels and presented them to her.",
      "23": "He asked her, \"Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?\"",
      "24": "\"I am the daughter of Bethuel,\" she answered. \"He's the son of Milcah and Nahor.",

      "28": "The young woman then ran ahead and informed her mother's household what had happened.",
      "29": "Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, who ran out to the man and met him at the spring.",
      "30": "And so it was, as soon as he saw the nose ring and bracelets on his sister's wrists, and as soon as he heard what his sister Rebekah was saying about what the man had spoken to her, he went out to the man who was still standing by the camels at the spring!",
      "31": "\"Come on,\" Laban said. \"The LORD has blessed you! So why are you standing out here when I've prepared some space in the house and a place for the camels?\"",
      "32": "So the servant went to the house and unbridled the camels. They provided straw and feed for the camels and water for washing his feet and those of the men with him.",
      "33": "But when they had prepared a meal and set it in front of him, he said, \"I'm not eating until I've spoken.\" \"Speak up!\" Laban exclaimed.",

      "41": "Only then will you be released from fulfilling my oath. However, when you come to my family, if they don't give her to you, you'll be released from fulfilling my oath.'",
      "42": "\"So today I arrived at the spring and prayed, 'LORD God of my master Abraham, if you wish to make the journey that I have traveled successful,",

      "44": "if she tells me to drink and also draws water for the camels, may she be the woman that the LORD has chosen for my master's son.'",
      "45": "\"Before I had finished praying, along came Rebekah with her jug on her shoulder! She went to the spring and drew some water. I asked her to please let me have a drink.",
      "46": "She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and told me, 'Have a drink while I also water your camels.' So I drank, and she also gave my camels water to drink.",
      "47": "\"That's when I asked, 'Whose daughter are you?' \"She replied, 'I'm the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore for him.' \"So I gave her a ring for her nose and bracelets for her wrists.",

      "49": "So now, if you wish to show gracious love and truth toward my master, tell me so. But if not, tell me, so that I may go elsewhere.\"",
      "50": "\"Since this has come from the LORD,\" Laban and Bethuel both replied, \"we cannot speak one way or another.",
      "51": "So here's Rebekah—she's right in front of you. Take her and go, so she can become a wife for your master's son, just as the LORD has decreed.\"",
      "52": "When Abraham's servant heard what they had said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.",
      "53": "Then the servant brought out some silver and gold items, along with some clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave gifts to her brother and to her mother.",
      "54": "He and the men with him ate and drank, and then they spent the night. When they got up the next morning, the servant requested, \"Send me off to my master.\"",

      "56": "\"Please don't delay me,\" the servant answered them. \"The LORD has made my journey successful. Send me off so I can return to my master.\"",
      "57": "But they said, \"We'll call the young lady and see what she has to say about this.\"",
      "58": "So they called Rebekah and asked her, \"Do you want to go with this man?\" \"I will go,\" she replied.",
      "59": "So they sent off their sister Rebekah, along with her personal assistant, Abraham's servant, and his men.",
      "60": "As they were leaving, they all blessed Rebekah by saying, \"Our sister, may you become the mother of tens of millions! May your descendants take over the city gates of those who hate them.\"",
      "61": "Then Rebekah and her young servant women got up, mounted their camels, and followed Abraham's servant, who took Rebekah and went on his way.",
