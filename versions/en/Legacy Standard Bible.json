      "22": "So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell .",
      "23": "And the messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them as far as the entrance of the gate.",
      "24": "And the archers shot at your servants from the wall; so some of the king’s servants died, and your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.”",

      "26": "Then the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband had died, so she lamented over her husband.",

      "31": "For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood, the lintel, and five-sided doorposts.",

      "3": "And it was paneled with cedar above the side chambers which were on the 45 pillars, 15 in each row.",
      "4": "Now there were artistic window frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three ranks.",
      "5": "And all the doorways and doorposts had squared artistic frames, and window was opposite window in three ranks.",

      "7": "And he made the hall of the throne where he was to judge, the hall of judgment, and it was paneled with cedar from floor to floor.",
      "8": "Now his house where he was to live, the other court inward from the hall, was of the same workmanship. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had married.",

      "14": "He was a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom and discernment and knowledge to do any work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and did all his work.",
      "15": "And he fashioned the two pillars of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both.",
      "16": "He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits.",
      "17": "There were nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.",

      "24": "Now under its brim gourds went around encircling it ten to a cubit, entirely encircling the sea; the gourds were in two rows, cast with the Sea when it was cast.",
      "25": "It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; and the sea was set on top of them, and all their rear parts turned inward.",
      "26": "And it was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, as a lily blossom; it could hold two thousand baths.",
      "27": "Then he made the ten stands of bronze; the length of each stand was four cubits and its width four cubits and its height three cubits.",
      "28": "Now this was the workmanship of the stands: they had borders, even borders between the frames,",
      "29": "and on the borders which were between the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the frames there was a pedestal above, and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.",
      "30": "Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports; beneath the laver were cast supports with wreaths at each side.",
      "31": "And its opening inside the capital at the top was a cubit, and its opening was round like the workmanship of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its opening there were engravings, and their borders were square, not round.",
      "32": "And the four wheels were underneath the borders, and the axles of the wheels were on the stand. And the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.",
      "33": "Now the workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.",
      "34": "Now there were four supports at the four corners of each stand; its supports were part of the stand itself.",
      "35": "And on the top of the stand there was a circular form half a cubit high, and on the top of the stand its stays and its borders were part of it.",
      "36": "And he engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders, cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the clear space on each, with wreaths all around.",
      "37": "He made the ten stands like this: all of them had one casting, one measure and one form.",
      "38": "He also made ten lavers of bronze, one laver held forty baths; each laver was four cubits, and on each of the ten stands was one laver.",
      "39": "Then he set the stands, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea of cast metal on the right side of the house eastward toward the south.",
      "40": "And Hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram completed doing all the work that he did for King Solomon in the house of Yahweh:",
      "41": "the two pillars and the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars,",

      "47": "And Solomon left all the utensils unweighed , because they were too many; the weight of the bronze could not be found out.",
      "48": "Solomon also made all the furniture which was in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar and the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;",

      "51": "Thus all the work that King Solomon did in the house of Yahweh was finished. And Solomon brought in the things set apart as holy by his father David, the silver and the gold and the utensils, and he put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh."

      "7": "For the sons of the wicked Athaliah had broken into the house of God and even used the holy things of the house of Yahweh for the Baals.",

Thus they did daily and collected much money.",

Why should you be struck down?” Then the prophet stopped and said, “I know that God has counseled to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”",

So he hurried to give her cosmetics and portions of food to her, and to give to her seven choice young women from the king’s house. And he transferred her and her young women to the best place in the harem.",

      "45": "Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will happen in the future; so the dream is certain, and its interpretation is trustworthy.”",

      "10": "Now when Daniel knew that the written document was signed, he entered his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously.",
      "11": "Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel seeking to make a petition and making supplication before his God.",
      "12": "Then they came near and said before the king concerning the king’s injunction, “Did you not sign an injunction that any man who seeks to make a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be cast into the lions’ den?” The king answered and said, “The word is certain, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.”",
      "13": "Then they answered and said before the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps seeking to make his petition three times a day.”",
      "14": "Then, as soon as the king heard this word, he was greatly distressed within himself and set his mind on saving Daniel; and even until sunset he kept exerting himself to deliver him.",
      "15": "Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”",
      "16": "Then the king said the word , and Daniel was brought in and cast into the lions’ den. The king answered and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you constantly serve will Himself save you.”",
      "17": "And a stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles so that nothing would be changed in regard to Daniel.",
      "18": "Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.",
      "19": "Then the king arose at dawn, at the break of day, and hurriedly went to the lions’ den.",
      "20": "When he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king answered and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to save you from the lions?”",
      "21": "Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever!",
      "22": "My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have done no harm.”",
      "23": "Then the king was greatly pleased and said for Daniel to be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no harm whatsoever was found on him because he had believed in his God.",
      "24": "The king then said the word , and they brought those men who had brought charges against Daniel, and they cast them, their children, and their wives into the lions’ den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.",
      "25": "Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations, and men of every tongue who were inhabiting all the land: “May your peace abound!",
      "26": "I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom, men are to fear and be in dread before the God of Daniel; For He is the living God and enduring forever, And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, And His dominion will be unto the end.",
      "27": "He saves and delivers and does signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has also saved Daniel from the power of the lions.”",

      "3": "And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another.",
      "4": "The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; and a heart of a man was given to it.",
      "5": "And behold, another beast, a second one in the likeness of a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and thus they said to it, ‘Arise, devour much meat!’",
      "6": "After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.",
      "7": "After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, fearsome and terrifying and extraordinarily strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.",
      "8": "While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great boasts .",
      "9": "“I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days was seated; His clothing was like white snow And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with fire, Its wheels were a burning fire.",

      "12": "As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for an appointed season of time.",

      "20": "and the meaning of the ten horns that were on its head and the other horn which came up and before which three of them fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth speaking great boasts and which was larger in appearance than its associates.",
      "21": "I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and overcoming them",
      "22": "until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the season arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom.",
      "23": "“Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it.",
      "24": "As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will make low three kings.",

      "7": "And I saw it reach the side of the ram, and it was enraged at it; and it struck the ram and broke its two horns in pieces, and the ram had no strength to stand in opposition to it. So it threw it down to the ground and trampled on it, and there was none to deliver the ram from its power.",
