      "21": "And they devoted to destruction everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.",

Set the people apart as holy and say, ‘Set yourselves apart as holy for tomorrow, for thus Yahweh, the God of Israel, has said, “There are things devoted to destruction in your midst, O Israel.

      "21": "Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall so he died at Thebez? Why did you approach the wall?’—then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’”",
      "22": "So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell .",
      "23": "And the messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them as far as the entrance of the gate.",
      "24": "And the archers shot at your servants from the wall; so some of the king’s servants died, and your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.”",
      "25": "Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab, ‘Do not let this thing be evil in your sight, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle against the city stronger and tear it down’; and so strengthen him.”",
      "26": "Then the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband had died, so she lamented over her husband.",
