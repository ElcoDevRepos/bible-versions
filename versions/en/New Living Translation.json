      "18": "Then the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him.”",
      "19": "So the LORD God formed from the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one.",

      "23": "“At last!” the man exclaimed. “This one is bone from my bone, and flesh from my flesh! She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken from ‘man.’”",

      "7": "At that moment their eyes were opened, and they suddenly felt shame at their nakedness. So they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.",

      "19": "When she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels, too, until they have had enough to drink.”",

      "32": "So the man went home with Laban, and Laban unloaded the camels, gave him straw for their bedding, fed them, and provided water for the man and the camel drivers to wash their feet.",

      "39": "“But I said to my master, ‘What if I can’t find a young woman who is willing to go back with me?’",

      "47": "“Then I asked, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel, and my grandparents are Nahor and Milcah.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.",
      "48": "“Then I bowed low and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master, Abraham, because he had led me straight to my master’s niece to be his son’s wife.",
      "49": "So tell me—will you or won’t you show unfailing love and faithfulness to my master? Please tell me yes or no, and then I’ll know what to do next.”",
      "50": "Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “The LORD has obviously brought you here, so there is nothing we can say.",
      "51": "Here is Rebekah; take her and go. Yes, let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has directed.”",
      "52": "When Abraham’s servant heard their answer, he bowed down to the ground and worshiped the LORD.",
      "53": "Then he brought out silver and gold jewelry and clothing and presented them to Rebekah. He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother.",

      "56": "But he said, “Don’t delay me. The LORD has made my mission successful; now send me back so I can return to my master.”",
      "57": "“Well,” they said, “we’ll call Rebekah and ask her what she thinks.”",
      "58": "So they called Rebekah. “Are you willing to go with this man?” they asked her. And she replied, “Yes, I will go.”",
      "59": "So they said good-bye to Rebekah and sent her away with Abraham’s servant and his men. The woman who had been Rebekah’s childhood nurse went along with her.",
      "60": "They gave her this blessing as she parted: “Our sister, may you become the mother of many millions! May your descendants be strong and conquer the cities of their enemies.”",
      "61": "Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the man. So Abraham’s servant took Rebekah and went on his way.",

      "18": "The next morning Jacob got up very early. He took the stone he had rested his head against, and he set it upright as a memorial pillar. Then he poured olive oil over it.",
      "19": "He named that place Bethel (which means “house of God”), although it was previously called Luz.",
      "20": "Then Jacob made this vow: “If God will indeed be with me and protect me on this journey, and if he will provide me with food and clothing,",
      "21": "and if I return safely to my father’s home, then the LORD will certainly be my God.",
      "22": "And this memorial pillar I have set up will become a place for worshiping God, and I will present to God a tenth of everything he gives me.”"

      "1": "Then Jacob hurried on, finally arriving in the land of the east.",
      "2": "He saw a well in the distance. Three flocks of sheep and goats lay in an open field beside it, waiting to be watered. But a heavy stone covered the mouth of the well.",
      "3": "It was the custom there to wait for all the flocks to arrive before removing the stone and watering the animals. Afterward the stone would be placed back over the mouth of the well.",
      "4": "Jacob went over to the shepherds and asked, “Where are you from, my friends?” “We are from Haran,” they answered.",
      "5": "“Do you know a man there named Laban, the grandson of Nahor?” he asked. “Yes, we do,” they replied.",
      "6": "“Is he doing well?” Jacob asked. “Yes, he’s well,” they answered. “Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the flock now.”",
      "7": "Jacob said, “Look, it’s still broad daylight—too early to round up the animals. Why don’t you water the sheep and goats so they can get back out to pasture?”",
      "8": "“We can’t water the animals until all the flocks have arrived,” they replied. “Then the shepherds move the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water all the sheep and goats.”",
      "9": "Jacob was still talking with them when Rachel arrived with her father’s flock, for she was a shepherd.",
      "10": "And because Rachel was his cousin—the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother—and because the sheep and goats belonged to his uncle Laban, Jacob went over to the well and moved the stone from its mouth and watered his uncle’s flock.",
      "11": "Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and he wept aloud.",
      "12": "He explained to Rachel that he was her cousin on her father’s side—the son of her aunt Rebekah. So Rachel quickly ran and told her father, Laban.",
      "13": "As soon as Laban heard that his nephew Jacob had arrived, he ran out to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him home. When Jacob had told him his story,",
      "14": "Laban exclaimed, “You really are my own flesh and blood!” After Jacob had stayed with Laban for about a month,",
      "15": "Laban said to him, “You shouldn’t work for me without pay just because we are relatives. Tell me how much your wages should be.”",
      "16": "Now Laban had two daughters. The older daughter was named Leah, and the younger one was Rachel.",
      "17": "There was no sparkle in Leah’s eyes, but Rachel had a beautiful figure and a lovely face.",
      "18": "Since Jacob was in love with Rachel, he told her father, “I’ll work for you for seven years if you’ll give me Rachel, your younger daughter, as my wife.”",
      "19": "“Agreed!” Laban replied. “I’d rather give her to you than to anyone else. Stay and work with me.”",
      "20": "So Jacob worked seven years to pay for Rachel. But his love for her was so strong that it seemed to him but a few days.",
      "21": "Finally, the time came for him to marry her. “I have fulfilled my agreement,” Jacob said to Laban. “Now give me my wife so I can sleep with her.”",
      "22": "So Laban invited everyone in the neighborhood and prepared a wedding feast.",
      "23": "But that night, when it was dark, Laban took Leah to Jacob, and he slept with her.",
      "24": "(Laban had given Leah a servant, Zilpah, to be her maid.)",
      "25": "But when Jacob woke up in the morning—it was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob raged at Laban. “I worked seven years for Rachel! Why have you tricked me?”",
      "26": "“It’s not our custom here to marry off a younger daughter ahead of the firstborn,” Laban replied.",
      "27": "“But wait until the bridal week is over; then we’ll give you Rachel, too—provided you promise to work another seven years for me.”",
      "28": "So Jacob agreed to work seven more years. A week after Jacob had married Leah, Laban gave him Rachel, too.",
      "29": "(Laban gave Rachel a servant, Bilhah, to be her maid.)",
      "30": "So Jacob slept with Rachel, too, and he loved her much more than Leah. He then stayed and worked for Laban the additional seven years.",
      "31": "When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to have children, but Rachel could not conceive.",
      "32": "So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “The LORD has noticed my misery, and now my husband will love me.”",
      "33": "She soon became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She named him Simeon, for she said, “The LORD heard that I was unloved and has given me another son.”",
      "34": "Then she became pregnant a third time and gave birth to another son. He was named Levi, for she said, “Surely this time my husband will feel affection for me, since I have given him three sons!”",
      "35": "Once again Leah became pregnant and gave birth to another son. She named him Judah, for she said, “Now I will praise the LORD!” And then she stopped having children."

      "3": "Then Rachel told him, “Take my maid, Bilhah, and sleep with her. She will bear children for me, and through her I can have a family, too.”",
      "4": "So Rachel gave her servant, Bilhah, to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her.",

      "9": "Meanwhile, Leah realized that she wasn’t getting pregnant anymore, so she took her servant, Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.",
      "10": "Soon Zilpah presented him with a son.",
      "11": "Leah named him Gad, for she said, “How fortunate I am!”",

      "13": "And Leah named him Asher, for she said, “What joy is mine! Now the other women will celebrate with me.”",
      "14": "One day during the wheat harvest, Reuben found some mandrakes growing in a field and brought them to his mother, Leah. Rachel begged Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”",
      "15": "But Leah angrily replied, “Wasn’t it enough that you stole my husband? Now will you steal my son’s mandrakes, too?” Rachel answered, “I will let Jacob sleep with you tonight if you give me some of the mandrakes.”",
      "16": "So that evening, as Jacob was coming home from the fields, Leah went out to meet him. “You must come and sleep with me tonight!” she said. “I have paid for you with some mandrakes that my son found.” So that night he slept with Leah.",
      "17": "And God answered Leah’s prayers. She became pregnant again and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob.",
      "18": "She named him Issachar, for she said, “God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband as a wife.”",
      "19": "Then Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob.",
      "20": "She named him Zebulun, for she said, “God has given me a good reward. Now my husband will treat me with respect, for I have given him six sons.”",
      "21": "Later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.",
      "22": "Then God remembered Rachel’s plight and answered her prayers by enabling her to have children.",

      "24": "And she named him Joseph, for she said, “May the LORD add yet another son to my family.”",

      "27": "“Please listen to me,” Laban replied. “I have become wealthy, for the LORD has blessed me because of you.",
      "28": "Tell me how much I owe you. Whatever it is, I’ll pay it.”",
      "29": "Jacob replied, “You know how hard I’ve worked for you, and how your flocks and herds have grown under my care.",
      "30": "You had little indeed before I came, but your wealth has increased enormously. The LORD has blessed you through everything I’ve done. But now, what about me? When can I start providing for my own family?”",
      "31": "“What wages do you want?” Laban asked again. Jacob replied, “Don’t give me anything. Just do this one thing, and I’ll continue to tend and watch over your flocks.",
      "32": "Let me inspect your flocks today and remove all the sheep and goats that are speckled or spotted, along with all the black sheep. Give these to me as my wages.",
      "33": "In the future, when you check on the animals you have given me as my wages, you’ll see that I have been honest. If you find in my flock any goats without speckles or spots, or any sheep that are not black, you will know that I have stolen them from you.”",
      "34": "“All right,” Laban replied. “It will be as you say.”",
      "35": "But that very day Laban went out and removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted or had white patches, and all the black sheep. He placed them in the care of his own sons,",
      "36": "who took them a three-days’ journey from where Jacob was. Meanwhile, Jacob stayed and cared for the rest of Laban’s flock.",
      "37": "Then Jacob took some fresh branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled off strips of bark, making white streaks on them.",
      "38": "Then he placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, for that was where they mated.",
      "39": "And when they mated in front of the white-streaked branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.",
      "40": "Jacob separated those lambs from Laban’s flock. And at mating time he turned the flock to face Laban’s animals that were streaked or black. This is how he built his own flock instead of increasing Laban’s.",
      "41": "Whenever the stronger females were ready to mate, Jacob would place the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of them. Then they would mate in front of the branches.",
      "42": "But he didn’t do this with the weaker ones, so the weaker lambs belonged to Laban, and the stronger ones were Jacob’s.",
      "43": "As a result, Jacob became very wealthy, with large flocks of sheep and goats, female and male servants, and many camels and donkeys."

      "3": "Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your father and grandfather and to your relatives there, and I will be with you.”",
      "4": "So Jacob called Rachel and Leah out to the field where he was watching his flock.",
      "5": "He said to them, “I have noticed that your father’s attitude toward me has changed. But the God of my father has been with me.",

      "7": "but he has cheated me, changing my wages ten times. But God has not allowed him to do me any harm.",
      "8": "For if he said, ‘The speckled animals will be your wages,’ the whole flock began to produce speckled young. And when he changed his mind and said, ‘The striped animals will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced striped young.",
      "9": "In this way, God has taken your father’s animals and given them to me.",
      "10": "“One time during the mating season, I had a dream and saw that the male goats mating with the females were streaked, speckled, and spotted.",
      "11": "Then in my dream, the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I replied, ‘Yes, here I am.’",
      "12": "“The angel said, ‘Look up, and you will see that only the streaked, speckled, and spotted males are mating with the females of your flock. For I have seen how Laban has treated you.",

      "14": "Rachel and Leah responded, “That’s fine with us! We won’t inherit any of our father’s wealth anyway.",
      "15": "He has reduced our rights to those of foreign women. And after he sold us, he wasted the money you paid him for us.",
      "16": "All the wealth God has given you from our father legally belongs to us and our children. So go ahead and do whatever God has told you.”",
      "17": "So Jacob put his wives and children on camels,",

      "19": "At the time they left, Laban was some distance away, shearing his sheep. Rachel stole her father’s household idols and took them with her.",
      "20": "Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, for they set out secretly and never told Laban they were leaving.",
      "21": "So Jacob took all his possessions with him and crossed the Euphrates River, heading for the hill country of Gilead.",
      "22": "Three days later, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.",
      "23": "So he gathered a group of his relatives and set out in hot pursuit. He caught up with Jacob seven days later in the hill country of Gilead.",

      "26": "“What do you mean by deceiving me like this?” Laban demanded. “How dare you drag my daughters away like prisoners of war?",
      "27": "Why did you slip away secretly? Why did you deceive me? And why didn’t you say you wanted to leave? I would have given you a farewell feast, with singing and music, accompanied by tambourines and harps.",
      "28": "Why didn’t you let me kiss my daughters and grandchildren and tell them good-bye? You have acted very foolishly!",
      "29": "I could destroy you, but the God of your father appeared to me last night and warned me, ‘Leave Jacob alone!’",
      "30": "I can understand your feeling that you must go, and your intense longing for your father’s home. But why have you stolen my gods?”",
      "31": "“I rushed away because I was afraid,” Jacob answered. “I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.",
      "32": "But as for your gods, see if you can find them, and let the person who has taken them die! And if you find anything else that belongs to you, identify it before all these relatives of ours, and I will give it back!” But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the household idols.",
      "33": "Laban went first into Jacob’s tent to search there, then into Leah’s, and then the tents of the two servant wives—but he found nothing. Finally, he went into Rachel’s tent.",
      "34": "But Rachel had taken the household idols and hidden them in her camel saddle, and now she was sitting on them. When Laban had thoroughly searched her tent without finding them,",
      "35": "she said to her father, “Please, sir, forgive me if I don’t get up for you. I’m having my monthly period.” So Laban continued his search, but he could not find the household idols.",
      "36": "Then Jacob became very angry, and he challenged Laban. “What’s my crime?” he demanded. “What have I done wrong to make you chase after me as though I were a criminal?",
      "37": "You have rummaged through everything I own. Now show me what you found that belongs to you! Set it out here in front of us, before our relatives, for all to see. Let them judge between us!",
      "38": "“For twenty years I have been with you, caring for your flocks. In all that time your sheep and goats never miscarried. In all those years I never used a single ram of yours for food.",
      "39": "If any were attacked and killed by wild animals, I never showed you the carcass and asked you to reduce the count of your flock. No, I took the loss myself! You made me pay for every stolen animal, whether it was taken in broad daylight or in the dark of night.",
      "40": "“I worked for you through the scorching heat of the day and through cold and sleepless nights.",
      "41": "Yes, for twenty years I slaved in your house! I worked for fourteen years earning your two daughters, and then six more years for your flock. And you changed my wages ten times!",
      "42": "In fact, if the God of my father had not been on my side—the God of Abraham and the fearsome God of Isaac—you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen your abuse and my hard work. That is why he appeared to you last night and rebuked you!”",
      "43": "Then Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks—in fact, everything you see is mine. But what can I do now about my daughters and their children?",
      "44": "So come, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and it will be a witness to our commitment.”",
      "45": "So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument.",

      "47": "To commemorate the event, Laban called the place Jegar-sahadutha (which means “witness pile” in Aramaic), and Jacob called it Galeed (which means “witness pile” in Hebrew).",
      "48": "Then Laban declared, “This pile of stones will stand as a witness to remind us of the covenant we have made today.” This explains why it was called Galeed—“Witness Pile.”",
      "49": "But it was also called Mizpah (which means “watchtower”), for Laban said, “May the LORD keep watch between us to make sure that we keep this covenant when we are out of each other’s sight.",
      "50": "If you mistreat my daughters or if you marry other wives, God will see it even if no one else does. He is a witness to this covenant between us.",
      "51": "“See this pile of stones,” Laban continued, “and see this monument I have set between us.",
      "52": "They stand between us as witnesses of our vows. I will never pass this pile of stones to harm you, and you must never pass these stones or this monument to harm me.",
      "53": "I call on the God of our ancestors—the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of my grandfather Nahor—to serve as a judge between us.” So Jacob took an oath before the fearsome God of his father, Isaac, to respect the boundary line.",
      "54": "Then Jacob offered a sacrifice to God there on the mountain and invited everyone to a covenant feast. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain.",

      "10": "I am not worthy of all the unfailing love and faithfulness you have shown to me, your servant. When I left home and crossed the Jordan River, I owned nothing except a walking stick. Now my household fills two large camps!",
      "11": "O LORD, please rescue me from the hand of my brother, Esau. I am afraid that he is coming to attack me, along with my wives and children.",
      "12": "But you promised me, ‘I will surely treat you kindly, and I will multiply your descendants until they become as numerous as the sands along the seashore—too many to count.’”",

      "17": "He gave these instructions to the men leading the first group: “When my brother, Esau, meets you, he will ask, ‘Whose servants are you? Where are you going? Who owns these animals?’",
      "18": "You must reply, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob, but they are a gift for his master Esau. Look, he is coming right behind us.’”",

      "4": "They remained in prison for quite some time, and the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, who looked after them.",
      "5": "While they were in prison, Pharaoh’s cup-bearer and baker each had a dream one night, and each dream had its own meaning.",

      "10": "The vine had three branches that began to bud and blossom, and soon it produced clusters of ripe grapes.",
      "11": "I was holding Pharaoh’s wine cup in my hand, so I took a cluster of grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup. Then I placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”",

      "27": "The seven thin, scrawny cows that came up later and the seven thin heads of grain, withered by the east wind, represent seven years of famine.",

      "33": "“Therefore, Pharaoh should find an intelligent and wise man and put him in charge of the entire land of Egypt.",
      "34": "Then Pharaoh should appoint supervisors over the land and let them collect one-fifth of all the crops during the seven good years.",
      "35": "Have them gather all the food produced in the good years that are just ahead and bring it to Pharaoh’s storehouses. Store it away, and guard it so there will be food in the cities.",

      "45": "Then Pharaoh gave Joseph a new Egyptian name, Zaphenath-paneah. He also gave him a wife, whose name was Asenath. She was the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On. So Joseph took charge of the entire land of Egypt.",
      "46": "He was thirty years old when he began serving in the court of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And when Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence, he inspected the entire land of Egypt.",
      "47": "As predicted, for seven years the land produced bumper crops.",
      "48": "During those years, Joseph gathered all the crops grown in Egypt and stored the grain from the surrounding fields in the cities.",
      "49": "He piled up huge amounts of grain like sand on the seashore. Finally, he stopped keeping records because there was too much to measure.",
      "50": "During this time, before the first of the famine years, two sons were born to Joseph and his wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On.",
      "51": "Joseph named his older son Manasseh, for he said, “God has made me forget all my troubles and everyone in my father’s family.”",
      "52": "Joseph named his second son Ephraim, for he said, “God has made me fruitful in this land of my grief.”",
      "53": "At last the seven years of bumper crops throughout the land of Egypt came to an end.",
      "54": "Then the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had predicted. The famine also struck all the surrounding countries, but throughout Egypt there was plenty of food.",
      "55": "Eventually, however, the famine spread throughout the land of Egypt as well. And when the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told them, “Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you.”",
      "56": "So with severe famine everywhere, Joseph opened up the storehouses and distributed grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout the land of Egypt.",

      "2": "I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy enough grain to keep us alive. Otherwise we’ll die.”",
      "3": "So Joseph’s ten older brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain.",
      "4": "But Jacob wouldn’t let Joseph’s younger brother, Benjamin, go with them, for fear some harm might come to him.",
      "5": "So Jacob’s sons arrived in Egypt along with others to buy food, for the famine was in Canaan as well.",
      "6": "Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt and in charge of selling grain to all the people, it was to him that his brothers came. When they arrived, they bowed before him with their faces to the ground.",
      "7": "Joseph recognized his brothers instantly, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where are you from?” he demanded. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied. “We have come to buy food.”",
      "8": "Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they didn’t recognize him.",
      "9": "And he remembered the dreams he’d had about them many years before. He said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.”",

      "11": "We are all brothers—members of the same family. We are honest men, sir! We are not spies!”",
      "12": "“Yes, you are!” Joseph insisted. “You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.”",
      "13": "“Sir,” they said, “there are actually twelve of us. We, your servants, are all brothers, sons of a man living in the land of Canaan. Our youngest brother is back there with our father right now, and one of our brothers is no longer with us.”",
      "14": "But Joseph insisted, “As I said, you are spies!",
      "15": "This is how I will test your story. I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you will never leave Egypt unless your youngest brother comes here!",
      "16": "One of you must go and get your brother. I’ll keep the rest of you here in prison. Then we’ll find out whether or not your story is true. By the life of Pharaoh, if it turns out that you don’t have a younger brother, then I’ll know you are spies.”",
      "17": "So Joseph put them all in prison for three days.",
      "18": "On the third day Joseph said to them, “I am a God-fearing man. If you do as I say, you will live.",
      "19": "If you really are honest men, choose one of your brothers to remain in prison. The rest of you may go home with grain for your starving families.",
      "20": "But you must bring your youngest brother back to me. This will prove that you are telling the truth, and you will not die.” To this they agreed.",
      "21": "Speaking among themselves, they said, “Clearly we are being punished because of what we did to Joseph long ago. We saw his anguish when he pleaded for his life, but we wouldn’t listen. That’s why we’re in this trouble.”",
      "22": "“Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy?” Reuben asked. “But you wouldn’t listen. And now we have to answer for his blood!”",
      "23": "Of course, they didn’t know that Joseph understood them, for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter.",
      "24": "Now he turned away from them and began to weep. When he regained his composure, he spoke to them again. Then he chose Simeon from among them and had him tied up right before their eyes.",

      "27": "But when they stopped for the night and one of them opened his sack to get grain for his donkey, he found his money in the top of his sack.",
      "28": "“Look!” he exclaimed to his brothers. “My money has been returned; it’s here in my sack!” Then their hearts sank. Trembling, they said to each other, “What has God done to us?”",
      "29": "When the brothers came to their father, Jacob, in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them.",
      "30": "“The man who is governor of the land spoke very harshly to us,” they told him. “He accused us of being spies scouting the land.",

      "32": "We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One brother is no longer with us, and the youngest is at home with our father in the land of Canaan.’",
      "33": "“Then the man who is governor of the land told us, ‘This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take grain for your starving families and go on home.",

      "3": "While at Micah’s house, they recognized the young Levite’s accent, so they went over and asked him, “Who brought you here, and what are you doing in this place? Why are you here?”",

      "19": "“Be quiet and come with us,” they said. “Be a father and priest to all of us. Isn’t it better to be a priest for an entire tribe and clan of Israel than for the household of just one man?”",

      "24": "“What do you mean, ‘What’s the matter?’” Micah replied. “You’ve taken away all the gods I have made, and my priest, and I have nothing left!”",
      "25": "The men of Dan said, “Watch what you say! There are some short-tempered men around here who might get angry and kill you and your family.”",
      "26": "So the men of Dan continued on their way. When Micah saw that there were too many of them for him to attack, he turned around and went home.",
      "27": "Then, with Micah’s idols and his priest, the men of Dan came to the town of Laish, whose people were peaceful and secure. They attacked with swords and burned the town to the ground.",
      "28": "There was no one to rescue the people, for they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby. This happened in the valley near Beth-rehob. Then the people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the town and lived there.",
      "29": "They renamed the town Dan after their ancestor, Israel’s son, but it had originally been called Laish.",
      "30": "Then they set up the carved image, and they appointed Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses, as their priest. This family continued as priests for the tribe of Dan until the Exile.",

      "15": "When Ruth went back to work again, Boaz ordered his young men, “Let her gather grain right among the sheaves without stopping her.",
      "16": "And pull out some heads of barley from the bundles and drop them on purpose for her. Let her pick them up, and don’t give her a hard time!”",
      "17": "So Ruth gathered barley there all day, and when she beat out the grain that evening, it filled an entire basket.",

      "19": "“Where did you gather all this grain today?” Naomi asked. “Where did you work? May the LORD bless the one who helped you!” So Ruth told her mother-in-law about the man in whose field she had worked. She said, “The man I worked with today is named Boaz.”",
      "20": "“May the LORD bless him!” Naomi told her daughter-in-law. “He is showing his kindness to us as well as to your dead husband. That man is one of our closest relatives, one of our family redeemers.”",
      "21": "Then Ruth said, “What’s more, Boaz even told me to come back and stay with his harvesters until the entire harvest is completed.”",
      "22": "“Good!” Naomi exclaimed. “Do as he said, my daughter. Stay with his young women right through the whole harvest. You might be harassed in other fields, but you’ll be safe with him.”",
      "23": "So Ruth worked alongside the women in Boaz’s fields and gathered grain with them until the end of the barley harvest. Then she continued working with them through the wheat harvest in early summer. And all the while she lived with her mother-in-law."

      "3": "Now do as I tell you—take a bath and put on perfume and dress in your nicest clothes. Then go to the threshing floor, but don’t let Boaz see you until he has finished eating and drinking.",
      "4": "Be sure to notice where he lies down; then go and uncover his feet and lie down there. He will tell you what to do.”",
      "5": "“I will do everything you say,” Ruth replied.",
      "6": "So she went down to the threshing floor that night and followed the instructions of her mother-in-law.",
      "7": "After Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he lay down at the far end of the pile of grain and went to sleep. Then Ruth came quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.",

      "10": "“The LORD bless you, my daughter!” Boaz exclaimed. “You are showing even more family loyalty now than you did before, for you have not gone after a younger man, whether rich or poor.",
      "11": "Now don’t worry about a thing, my daughter. I will do what is necessary, for everyone in town knows you are a virtuous woman.",
      "12": "But while it’s true that I am one of your family redeemers, there is another man who is more closely related to you than I am.",
      "13": "Stay here tonight, and in the morning I will talk to him. If he is willing to redeem you, very well. Let him marry you. But if he is not willing, then as surely as the LORD lives, I will redeem you myself! Now lie down here until morning.”",
      "14": "So Ruth lay at Boaz’s feet until the morning, but she got up before it was light enough for people to recognize each other. For Boaz had said, “No one must know that a woman was here at the threshing floor.”",
      "15": "Then Boaz said to her, “Bring your cloak and spread it out.” He measured six scoops of barley into the cloak and placed it on her back. Then he returned to the town.",

      "4": "I thought I should speak to you about it so that you can redeem it if you wish. If you want the land, then buy it here in the presence of these witnesses. But if you don’t want it, let me know right away, because I am next in line to redeem it after you.” The man replied, “All right, I’ll redeem it.”",
      "5": "Then Boaz told him, “Of course, your purchase of the land from Naomi also requires that you marry Ruth, the Moabite widow. That way she can have children who will carry on her husband’s name and keep the land in the family.”",
      "6": "“Then I can’t redeem it,” the family redeemer replied, “because this might endanger my own estate. You redeem the land; I cannot do it.”",

      "9": "Then Boaz said to the elders and to the crowd standing around, “You are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.",
      "10": "And with the land I have acquired Ruth, the Moabite widow of Mahlon, to be my wife. This way she can have a son to carry on the family name of her dead husband and to inherit the family property here in his hometown. You are all witnesses today.”",
      "11": "Then the elders and all the people standing in the gate replied, “We are witnesses! May the LORD make this woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, from whom all the nation of Israel descended! May you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.",

      "14": "Then the women of the town said to Naomi, “Praise the LORD, who has now provided a redeemer for your family! May this child be famous in Israel.",
      "15": "May he restore your youth and care for you in your old age. For he is the son of your daughter-in-law who loves you and has been better to you than seven sons!”",

      "6": "Don’t be stubborn and rebellious as Pharaoh and the Egyptians were. By the time God was finished with them, they were eager to let Israel go.",
      "7": "“Now build a new cart, and find two cows that have just given birth to calves. Make sure the cows have never been yoked to a cart. Hitch the cows to the cart, but shut their calves away from them in a pen.",
      "8": "Put the Ark of the LORD on the cart, and beside it place a chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors you are sending as a guilt offering. Then let the cows go wherever they want.",
      "9": "If they cross the border of our land and go to Beth-shemesh, we will know it was the LORD who brought this great disaster upon us. If they don’t, we will know it was not his hand that caused the plague. It came simply by chance.”",
      "10": "So these instructions were carried out. Two cows were hitched to the cart, and their newborn calves were shut up in a pen.",
      "11": "Then the Ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors were placed on the cart.",
      "12": "And sure enough, without veering off in other directions, the cows went straight along the road toward Beth-shemesh, lowing as they went. The Philistine rulers followed them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.",
      "13": "The people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they saw the Ark, they were overjoyed!",
      "14": "The cart came into the field of a man named Joshua and stopped beside a large rock. So the people broke up the wood of the cart for a fire and killed the cows and sacrificed them to the LORD as a burnt offering.",
      "15": "Several men of the tribe of Levi lifted the Ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors from the cart and placed them on the large rock. Many sacrifices and burnt offerings were offered to the LORD that day by the people of Beth-shemesh.",
      "16": "The five Philistine rulers watched all this and then returned to Ekron that same day.",
      "17": "The five gold tumors sent by the Philistines as a guilt offering to the LORD were gifts from the rulers of Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.",
      "18": "The five gold rats represented the five Philistine towns and their surrounding villages, which were controlled by the five rulers. The large rock at Beth-shemesh, where they set the Ark of the LORD, still stands in the field of Joshua as a witness to what happened there.",

      "6": "So they gathered at Mizpah and, in a great ceremony, drew water from a well and poured it out before the LORD. They also went without food all day and confessed that they had sinned against the LORD. (It was at Mizpah that Samuel became Israel’s judge.)",
      "7": "When the Philistine rulers heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah, they mobilized their army and advanced. The Israelites were badly frightened when they learned that the Philistines were approaching.",
      "8": "“Don’t stop pleading with the LORD our God to save us from the Philistines!” they begged Samuel.",

      "12": "Samuel then took a large stone and placed it between the towns of Mizpah and Jeshanah. He named it Ebenezer (which means “the stone of help”), for he said, “Up to this point the LORD has helped us!”",
      "13": "So the Philistines were subdued and didn’t invade Israel again for some time. And throughout Samuel’s lifetime, the LORD’s powerful hand was raised against the Philistines.",

      "9": "Do as they ask, but solemnly warn them about the way a king will reign over them.”",
      "10": "So Samuel passed on the LORD’s warning to the people who were asking him for a king.",
      "11": "“This is how a king will reign over you,” Samuel said. “The king will draft your sons and assign them to his chariots and his charioteers, making them run before his chariots.",
      "12": "Some will be generals and captains in his army, some will be forced to plow in his fields and harvest his crops, and some will make his weapons and chariot equipment.",

      "14": "He will take away the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his own officials.",
      "15": "He will take a tenth of your grain and your grape harvest and distribute it among his officers and attendants.",
      "16": "He will take your male and female slaves and demand the finest of your cattle and donkeys for his own use.",
      "17": "He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you will be his slaves.",

He gouged out the right eye of each of the Israelites living there, and he didn’t allow anyone to come and rescue them. In fact, of all the Israelites east of the Jordan, there wasn’t a single one whose right eye Nahash had not gouged out.

      "3": "Among Saul’s men was Ahijah the priest, who was wearing the ephod, the priestly vest. Ahijah was the son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD who had served at Shiloh. No one realized that Jonathan had left the Israelite camp.",
      "4": "To reach the Philistine outpost, Jonathan had to go down between two rocky cliffs that were called Bozez and Seneh.",
      "5": "The cliff on the north was in front of Micmash, and the one on the south was in front of Geba.",
      "6": "“Let’s go across to the outpost of those pagans,” Jonathan said to his armor bearer. “Perhaps the LORD will help us, for nothing can hinder the LORD. He can win a battle whether he has many warriors or only a few!”",
      "7": "“Do what you think is best,” the armor bearer replied. “I’m with you completely, whatever you decide.”",
      "8": "“All right, then,” Jonathan told him. “We will cross over and let them see us.",
      "9": "If they say to us, ‘Stay where you are or we’ll kill you,’ then we will stop and not go up to them.",
      "10": "But if they say, ‘Come on up and fight,’ then we will go up. That will be the LORD’s sign that he will help us defeat them.”",
      "11": "When the Philistines saw them coming, they shouted, “Look! The Hebrews are crawling out of their holes!”",
      "12": "Then the men from the outpost shouted to Jonathan, “Come on up here, and we’ll teach you a lesson!” “Come on, climb right behind me,” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “for the LORD will help us defeat them!”",
      "13": "So they climbed up using both hands and feet, and the Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer killed those who came behind them.",
      "14": "They killed some twenty men in all, and their bodies were scattered over about half an acre.",
      "15": "Suddenly, panic broke out in the Philistine army, both in the camp and in the field, including even the outposts and raiding parties. And just then an earthquake struck, and everyone was terrified.",
      "16": "Saul’s lookouts in Gibeah of Benjamin saw a strange sight—the vast army of Philistines began to melt away in every direction.",
      "17": "“Call the roll and find out who’s missing,” Saul ordered. And when they checked, they found that Jonathan and his armor bearer were gone.",
      "18": "Then Saul shouted to Ahijah, “Bring the ephod here!” For at that time Ahijah was wearing the ephod in front of the Israelites.",
      "19": "But while Saul was talking to the priest, the confusion in the Philistine camp grew louder and louder. So Saul said to the priest, “Never mind; let’s get going!”",

      "26": "They didn’t dare touch the honey because they all feared the oath they had taken.",
      "27": "But Jonathan had not heard his father’s command, and he dipped the end of his stick into a piece of honeycomb and ate the honey. After he had eaten it, he felt refreshed.",
      "28": "But one of the men saw him and said, “Your father made the army take a strict oath that anyone who eats food today will be cursed. That is why everyone is weary and faint.”",
      "29": "“My father has made trouble for us all!” Jonathan exclaimed. “A command like that only hurts us. See how refreshed I am now that I have eaten this little bit of honey.",
      "30": "If the men had been allowed to eat freely from the food they found among our enemies, think how many more Philistines we could have killed!”",

      "34": "Then go out among the troops and tell them, ‘Bring the cattle, sheep, and goats here to me. Kill them here, and drain the blood before you eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.’” So that night all the troops brought their animals and slaughtered them there.",
      "35": "Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first of the altars he built to the LORD.",
      "36": "Then Saul said, “Let’s chase the Philistines all night and plunder them until sunrise. Let’s destroy every last one of them.” His men replied, “We’ll do whatever you think is best.” But the priest said, “Let’s ask God first.”",
      "37": "So Saul asked God, “Should we go after the Philistines? Will you help us defeat them?” But God made no reply that day.",
      "38": "Then Saul said to the leaders, “Something’s wrong! I want all my army commanders to come here. We must find out what sin was committed today.",
      "39": "I vow by the name of the LORD who rescued Israel that the sinner will surely die, even if it is my own son Jonathan!” But no one would tell him what the trouble was.",
      "40": "Then Saul said, “Jonathan and I will stand over here, and all of you stand over there.” And the people responded to Saul, “Whatever you think is best.”",
      "41": "Then Saul prayed, “O LORD, God of Israel, please show us who is guilty and who is innocent.” Then they cast sacred lots, and Jonathan and Saul were chosen as the guilty ones, and the people were declared innocent.",
      "42": "Then Saul said, “Now cast lots again and choose between me and Jonathan.” And Jonathan was shown to be the guilty one.",
      "43": "“Tell me what you have done,” Saul demanded of Jonathan. “I tasted a little honey,” Jonathan admitted. “It was only a little bit on the end of my stick. Does that deserve death?”",
      "44": "“Yes, Jonathan,” Saul said, “you must die! May God strike me and even kill me if you do not die for this.”",
      "45": "But the people broke in and said to Saul, “Jonathan has won this great victory for Israel. Should he die? Far from it! As surely as the LORD lives, not one hair on his head will be touched, for God helped him do a great deed today.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.",
      "46": "Then Saul called back the army from chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines returned home.",
      "47": "Now when Saul had secured his grasp on Israel’s throne, he fought against his enemies in every direction—against Moab, Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. And wherever he turned, he was victorious.",
      "48": "He performed great deeds and conquered the Amalekites, saving Israel from all those who had plundered them.",

      "20": "“But I did obey the LORD,” Saul insisted. “I carried out the mission he gave me. I brought back King Agag, but I destroyed everyone else.",

But first you must prove yourself to be a real warrior by fighting the LORD’s battles.” For Saul thought, “I’ll send him out against the Philistines and let them kill him rather than doing it myself.”",

      "3": "This man’s name was Nabal, and his wife, Abigail, was a sensible and beautiful woman. But Nabal, a descendant of Caleb, was crude and mean in all his dealings.",
      "4": "When David heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep,",
      "5": "he sent ten of his young men to Carmel with this message for Nabal:",
      "6": "“Peace and prosperity to you, your family, and everything you own!",
      "7": "I am told that it is sheep-shearing time. While your shepherds stayed among us near Carmel, we never harmed them, and nothing was ever stolen from them.",
      "8": "Ask your own men, and they will tell you this is true. So would you be kind to us, since we have come at a time of celebration? Please share any provisions you might have on hand with us and with your friend David.”",
      "9": "David’s young men gave this message to Nabal in David’s name, and they waited for a reply.",
      "10": "“Who is this fellow David?” Nabal sneered to the young men. “Who does this son of Jesse think he is? There are lots of servants these days who run away from their masters.",
      "11": "Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I’ve slaughtered for my shearers and give it to a band of outlaws who come from who knows where?”",
      "12": "So David’s young men returned and told him what Nabal had said.",
      "13": "“Get your swords!” was David’s reply as he strapped on his own. Then 400 men started off with David, and 200 remained behind to guard their equipment.",
      "14": "Meanwhile, one of Nabal’s servants went to Abigail and told her, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he screamed insults at them.",
      "15": "These men have been very good to us, and we never suffered any harm from them. Nothing was stolen from us the whole time they were with us.",
      "16": "In fact, day and night they were like a wall of protection to us and the sheep.",
      "17": "You need to know this and figure out what to do, for there is going to be trouble for our master and his whole family. He’s so ill-tempered that no one can even talk to him!”",
      "18": "Abigail wasted no time. She quickly gathered 200 loaves of bread, two wineskins full of wine, five sheep that had been slaughtered, nearly a bushel of roasted grain, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 fig cakes. She packed them on donkeys",
      "19": "and said to her servants, “Go on ahead. I will follow you shortly.” But she didn’t tell her husband Nabal what she was doing.",
      "20": "As she was riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, she saw David and his men coming toward her.",
      "21": "David had just been saying, “A lot of good it did to help this fellow. We protected his flocks in the wilderness, and nothing he owned was lost or stolen. But he has repaid me evil for good.",
      "22": "May God strike me and kill me if even one man of his household is still alive tomorrow morning!”",
      "23": "When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed low before him.",
      "24": "She fell at his feet and said, “I accept all blame in this matter, my lord. Please listen to what I have to say.",
      "25": "I know Nabal is a wicked and ill-tempered man; please don’t pay any attention to him. He is a fool, just as his name suggests. But I never even saw the young men you sent.",
      "26": "“Now, my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, since the LORD has kept you from murdering and taking vengeance into your own hands, let all your enemies and those who try to harm you be as cursed as Nabal is.",
      "27": "And here is a present that I, your servant, have brought to you and your young men.",
      "28": "Please forgive me if I have offended you in any way. The LORD will surely reward you with a lasting dynasty, for you are fighting the LORD’s battles. And you have not done wrong throughout your entire life.",
      "29": "“Even when you are chased by those who seek to kill you, your life is safe in the care of the LORD your God, secure in his treasure pouch! But the lives of your enemies will disappear like stones shot from a sling!",
      "30": "When the LORD has done all he promised and has made you leader of Israel,",
      "31": "don’t let this be a blemish on your record. Then your conscience won’t have to bear the staggering burden of needless bloodshed and vengeance. And when the LORD has done these great things for you, please remember me, your servant!”",
      "32": "David replied to Abigail, “Praise the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you to meet me today!",
      "33": "Thank God for your good sense! Bless you for keeping me from murder and from carrying out vengeance with my own hands.",
      "34": "For I swear by the LORD, the God of Israel, who has kept me from hurting you, that if you had not hurried out to meet me, not one of Nabal’s men would still be alive tomorrow morning.”",
      "35": "Then David accepted her present and told her, “Return home in peace. I have heard what you said. We will not kill your husband.”",
      "36": "When Abigail arrived home, she found that Nabal was throwing a big party and was celebrating like a king. He was very drunk, so she didn’t tell him anything about her meeting with David until dawn the next day.",
      "37": "In the morning when Nabal was sober, his wife told him what had happened. As a result he had a stroke, and he lay paralyzed on his bed like a stone.",
      "38": "About ten days later, the LORD struck him, and he died.",
      "39": "When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise the LORD, who has avenged the insult I received from Nabal and has kept me from doing it myself. Nabal has received the punishment for his sin.” Then David sent messengers to Abigail to ask her to become his wife.",
      "40": "When the messengers arrived at Carmel, they told Abigail, “David has sent us to take you back to marry him.”",
      "41": "She bowed low to the ground and responded, “I, your servant, would be happy to marry David. I would even be willing to become a slave, washing the feet of his servants!”",
      "42": "Quickly getting ready, she took along five of her servant girls as attendants, mounted her donkey, and went with David’s messengers. And so she became his wife.",
      "43": "David also married Ahinoam from Jezreel, making both of them his wives.",

      "9": "“No!” David said. “Don’t kill him. For who can remain innocent after attacking the LORD’s anointed one?",
      "10": "Surely the LORD will strike Saul down someday, or he will die of old age or in battle.",
      "11": "The LORD forbid that I should kill the one he has anointed! But take his spear and that jug of water beside his head, and then let’s get out of here!”",

      "19": "But now let my lord the king listen to his servant. If the LORD has stirred you up against me, then let him accept my offering. But if this is simply a human scheme, then may those involved be cursed by the LORD. For they have driven me from my home, so I can no longer live among the LORD’s people, and they have said, ‘Go, worship pagan gods.’",

      "23": "The LORD gives his own reward for doing good and for being loyal, and I refused to kill you even when the LORD placed you in my power, for you are the LORD’s anointed one.",

      "1": "After this, Absalom bought a chariot and horses, and he hired fifty bodyguards to run ahead of him.",
      "2": "He got up early every morning and went out to the gate of the city. When people brought a case to the king for judgment, Absalom would ask where in Israel they were from, and they would tell him their tribe.",
      "3": "Then Absalom would say, “You’ve really got a strong case here! It’s too bad the king doesn’t have anyone to hear it.",
      "4": "I wish I were the judge. Then everyone could bring their cases to me for judgment, and I would give them justice!”",
      "5": "When people tried to bow before him, Absalom wouldn’t let them. Instead, he took them by the hand and kissed them.",
      "6": "Absalom did this with everyone who came to the king for judgment, and so he stole the hearts of all the people of Israel.",
      "7": "After four years, Absalom said to the king, “Let me go to Hebron to offer a sacrifice to the LORD and fulfill a vow I made to him.",
      "8": "For while your servant was at Geshur in Aram, I promised to sacrifice to the LORD in Hebron if he would bring me back to Jerusalem.”",
      "9": "“All right,” the king told him. “Go and fulfill your vow.” So Absalom went to Hebron.",
      "10": "But while he was there, he sent secret messengers to all the tribes of Israel to stir up a rebellion against the king. “As soon as you hear the ram’s horn,” his message read, “you are to say, ‘Absalom has been crowned king in Hebron.’”",
      "11": "He took 200 men from Jerusalem with him as guests, but they knew nothing of his intentions.",
      "12": "While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel, one of David’s counselors who lived in Giloh. Soon many others also joined Absalom, and the conspiracy gained momentum.",
      "13": "A messenger soon arrived in Jerusalem to tell David, “All Israel has joined Absalom in a conspiracy against you!”",
      "14": "“Then we must flee at once, or it will be too late!” David urged his men. “Hurry! If we get out of the city before Absalom arrives, both we and the city of Jerusalem will be spared from disaster.”",
      "15": "“We are with you,” his advisers replied. “Do what you think is best.”",
      "16": "So the king and all his household set out at once. He left no one behind except ten of his concubines to look after the palace.",
      "17": "The king and all his people set out on foot, pausing at the last house",
      "18": "to let all the king’s men move past to lead the way. There were 600 men from Gath who had come with David, along with the king’s bodyguard.",
      "19": "Then the king turned and said to Ittai, a leader of the men from Gath, “Why are you coming with us? Go on back to King Absalom, for you are a guest in Israel, a foreigner in exile.",
      "20": "You arrived only recently, and should I force you today to wander with us? I don’t even know where we will go. Go on back and take your kinsmen with you, and may the LORD show you his unfailing love and faithfulness.”",
      "21": "But Ittai said to the king, “I vow by the LORD and by your own life that I will go wherever my lord the king goes, no matter what happens—whether it means life or death.”",
      "22": "David replied, “All right, come with us.” So Ittai and all his men and their families went along.",
      "23": "Everyone cried loudly as the king and his followers passed by. They crossed the Kidron Valley and then went out toward the wilderness.",
      "24": "Zadok and all the Levites also came along, carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until everyone had passed out of the city.",
      "25": "Then the king instructed Zadok to take the Ark of God back into the city. “If the LORD sees fit,” David said, “he will bring me back to see the Ark and the Tabernacle again.",
      "26": "But if he is through with me, then let him do what seems best to him.”",
      "27": "The king also told Zadok the priest, “Look, here is my plan. You and Abiathar should return quietly to the city with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan.",
      "28": "I will stop at the shallows of the Jordan River and wait there for a report from you.”",
      "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of God back to the city and stayed there.",
      "30": "David walked up the road to the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went. His head was covered and his feet were bare as a sign of mourning. And the people who were with him covered their heads and wept as they climbed the hill.",
      "31": "When someone told David that his adviser Ahithophel was now backing Absalom, David prayed, “O LORD, let Ahithophel give Absalom foolish advice!”",
      "32": "When David reached the summit of the Mount of Olives where people worshiped God, Hushai the Arkite was waiting there for him. Hushai had torn his clothing and put dirt on his head as a sign of mourning.",
      "33": "But David told him, “If you go with me, you will only be a burden.",
      "34": "Return to Jerusalem and tell Absalom, ‘I will now be your adviser, O king, just as I was your father’s adviser in the past.’ Then you can frustrate and counter Ahithophel’s advice.",
      "35": "Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, will be there. Tell them about the plans being made in the king’s palace,",
      "36": "and they will send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to tell me what is going on.”",

      "1": "When David had gone a little beyond the summit of the Mount of Olives, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, was waiting there for him. He had two donkeys loaded with 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 bunches of summer fruit, and a wineskin full of wine.",
      "2": "“What are these for?” the king asked Ziba. Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s people to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat. The wine is for those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”",
      "3": "“And where is Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson?” the king asked him. “He stayed in Jerusalem,” Ziba replied. “He said, ‘Today I will get back the kingdom of my grandfather Saul.’”",
      "4": "“In that case,” the king told Ziba, “I give you everything Mephibosheth owns.” “I bow before you,” Ziba replied. “May I always be pleasing to you, my lord the king.”",
      "5": "As King David came to Bahurim, a man came out of the village cursing them. It was Shimei son of Gera, from the same clan as Saul’s family.",
      "6": "He threw stones at the king and the king’s officers and all the mighty warriors who surrounded him.",
      "7": "“Get out of here, you murderer, you scoundrel!” he shouted at David.",
      "8": "“The LORD is paying you back for all the bloodshed in Saul’s clan. You stole his throne, and now the LORD has given it to your son Absalom. At last you will taste some of your own medicine, for you are a murderer!”",
      "9": "“Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?” Abishai son of Zeruiah demanded. “Let me go over and cut off his head!”",
      "10": "“No!” the king said. “Who asked your opinion, you sons of Zeruiah! If the LORD has told him to curse me, who are you to stop him?”",
      "11": "Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “My own son is trying to kill me. Doesn’t this relative of Saul have even more reason to do so? Leave him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to do it.",
      "12": "And perhaps the LORD will see that I am being wronged and will bless me because of these curses today.”",
      "13": "So David and his men continued down the road, and Shimei kept pace with them on a nearby hillside, cursing and throwing stones and dirt at David.",
      "14": "The king and all who were with him grew weary along the way, so they rested when they reached the Jordan River.",
      "15": "Meanwhile, Absalom and all the army of Israel arrived at Jerusalem, accompanied by Ahithophel.",
      "16": "When David’s friend Hushai the Arkite arrived, he went immediately to see Absalom. “Long live the king!” he exclaimed. “Long live the king!”",
      "17": "“Is this the way you treat your friend David?” Absalom asked him. “Why aren’t you with him?”",
      "18": "“I’m here because I belong to the man who is chosen by the LORD and by all the men of Israel,” Hushai replied.",
      "19": "“And anyway, why shouldn’t I serve you? Just as I was your father’s adviser, now I will be your adviser!”",
      "20": "Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and asked him, “What should I do next?”",
      "21": "Ahithophel told him, “Go and sleep with your father’s concubines, for he has left them here to look after the palace. Then all Israel will know that you have insulted your father beyond hope of reconciliation, and they will throw their support to you.”",
      "22": "So they set up a tent on the palace roof where everyone could see it, and Absalom went in and had sex with his father’s concubines.",
      "23": "Absalom followed Ahithophel’s advice, just as David had done. For every word Ahithophel spoke seemed as wise as though it had come directly from the mouth of God."

      "2": "I will catch up with him while he is weary and discouraged. He and his troops will panic, and everyone will run away. Then I will kill only the king,",
      "3": "and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride returns to her husband. After all, it is only one man’s life that you seek. Then you will be at peace with all the people.”",
      "4": "This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.",
      "5": "But then Absalom said, “Bring in Hushai the Arkite. Let’s see what he thinks about this.”",
      "6": "When Hushai arrived, Absalom told him what Ahithophel had said. Then he asked, “What is your opinion? Should we follow Ahithophel’s advice? If not, what do you suggest?”",
      "7": "“Well,” Hushai replied to Absalom, “this time Ahithophel has made a mistake.",
      "8": "You know your father and his men; they are mighty warriors. Right now they are as enraged as a mother bear who has been robbed of her cubs. And remember that your father is an experienced man of war. He won’t be spending the night among the troops.",
      "9": "He has probably already hidden in some pit or cave. And when he comes out and attacks and a few of your men fall, there will be panic among your troops, and the word will spread that Absalom’s men are being slaughtered.",
      "10": "Then even the bravest soldiers, though they have the heart of a lion, will be paralyzed with fear. For all Israel knows what a mighty warrior your father is and how courageous his men are.",
      "11": "“I recommend that you mobilize the entire army of Israel, bringing them from as far away as Dan in the north and Beersheba in the south. That way you will have an army as numerous as the sand on the seashore. And I advise that you personally lead the troops.",
      "12": "When we find David, we’ll fall on him like dew that falls on the ground. Then neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.",
      "13": "And if David were to escape into some town, you will have all Israel there at your command. Then we can take ropes and drag the walls of the town into the nearest valley until every stone is torn down.”",
      "14": "Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “Hushai’s advice is better than Ahithophel’s.” For the LORD had determined to defeat the counsel of Ahithophel, which really was the better plan, so that he could bring disaster on Absalom!",
      "15": "Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, what Ahithophel had said to Absalom and the elders of Israel and what he himself had advised instead.",
      "16": "“Quick!” he told them. “Find David and urge him not to stay at the shallows of the Jordan River tonight. He must go across at once into the wilderness beyond. Otherwise he will die and his entire army with him.”",
      "17": "Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been staying at En-rogel so as not to be seen entering and leaving the city. Arrangements had been made for a servant girl to bring them the message they were to take to King David.",
      "18": "But a boy spotted them at En-rogel, and he told Absalom about it. So they quickly escaped to Bahurim, where a man hid them down inside a well in his courtyard.",
      "19": "The man’s wife put a cloth over the top of the well and scattered grain on it to dry in the sun; so no one suspected they were there.",
      "20": "When Absalom’s men arrived, they asked her, “Have you seen Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman replied, “They were here, but they crossed over the brook.” Absalom’s men looked for them without success and returned to Jerusalem.",
      "21": "Then the two men crawled out of the well and hurried on to King David. “Quick!” they told him, “cross the Jordan tonight!” And they told him how Ahithophel had advised that he be captured and killed.",
      "22": "So David and all the people with him went across the Jordan River during the night, and they were all on the other bank before dawn.",
      "23": "When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey, went to his hometown, set his affairs in order, and hanged himself. He died there and was buried in the family tomb.",
      "24": "David soon arrived at Mahanaim. By now, Absalom had mobilized the entire army of Israel and was leading his troops across the Jordan River.",
      "25": "Absalom had appointed Amasa as commander of his army, replacing Joab, who had been commander under David. (Amasa was Joab’s cousin. His father was Jether, an Ishmaelite. His mother, Abigail daughter of Nahash, was the sister of Joab’s mother, Zeruiah.)",
      "26": "Absalom and the Israelite army set up camp in the land of Gilead.",
      "27": "When David arrived at Mahanaim, he was warmly greeted by Shobi son of Nahash, who came from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and by Makir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and by Barzillai of Gilead from Rogelim.",
      "28": "They brought sleeping mats, cooking pots, serving bowls, wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans, lentils,",
      "29": "honey, butter, sheep, goats, and cheese for David and those who were with him. For they said, “You must all be very hungry and tired and thirsty after your long march through the wilderness.”"

      "1": "David now mustered the men who were with him and appointed generals and captains to lead them.",
      "2": "He sent the troops out in three groups, placing one group under Joab, one under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and one under Ittai, the man from Gath. The king told his troops, “I am going out with you.”",
      "3": "But his men objected strongly. “You must not go,” they urged. “If we have to turn and run—and even if half of us die—it will make no difference to Absalom’s troops; they will be looking only for you. You are worth 10,000 of us, and it is better that you stay here in the town and send help if we need it.”",
      "4": "“If you think that’s the best plan, I’ll do it,” the king answered. So he stood alongside the gate of the town as all the troops marched out in groups of hundreds and of thousands.",
      "5": "And the king gave this command to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: “For my sake, deal gently with young Absalom.” And all the troops heard the king give this order to his commanders.",
      "6": "So the battle began in the forest of Ephraim,",
      "7": "and the Israelite troops were beaten back by David’s men. There was a great slaughter that day, and 20,000 men laid down their lives.",
      "8": "The battle raged all across the countryside, and more men died because of the forest than were killed by the sword.",
      "9": "During the battle, Absalom happened to come upon some of David’s men. He tried to escape on his mule, but as he rode beneath the thick branches of a great tree, his hair got caught in the tree. His mule kept going and left him dangling in the air.",
      "10": "One of David’s men saw what had happened and told Joab, “I saw Absalom dangling from a great tree.”",
      "11": "“What?” Joab demanded. “You saw him there and didn’t kill him? I would have rewarded you with ten pieces of silver and a hero’s belt!”",
      "12": "“I would not kill the king’s son for even a thousand pieces of silver,” the man replied to Joab. “We all heard the king say to you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘For my sake, please spare young Absalom.’",
      "13": "And if I had betrayed the king by killing his son—and the king would certainly find out who did it—you yourself would be the first to abandon me.”",
      "14": "“Enough of this nonsense,” Joab said. Then he took three daggers and plunged them into Absalom’s heart as he dangled, still alive, in the great tree.",
      "15": "Ten of Joab’s young armor bearers then surrounded Absalom and killed him.",
      "16": "Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and his men returned from chasing the army of Israel.",
      "17": "They threw Absalom’s body into a deep pit in the forest and piled a great heap of stones over it. And all Israel fled to their homes.",
      "18": "During his lifetime, Absalom had built a monument to himself in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to carry on my name.” He named the monument after himself, and it is known as Absalom’s Monument to this day.",
      "19": "Then Zadok’s son Ahimaaz said, “Let me run to the king with the good news that the LORD has rescued him from his enemies.”",
      "20": "“No,” Joab told him, “it wouldn’t be good news to the king that his son is dead. You can be my messenger another time, but not today.”",
      "21": "Then Joab said to a man from Ethiopia, “Go tell the king what you have seen.” The man bowed and ran off.",
      "22": "But Ahimaaz continued to plead with Joab, “Whatever happens, please let me go, too.” “Why should you go, my son?” Joab replied. “There will be no reward for your news.”",
      "23": "“Yes, but let me go anyway,” he begged. Joab finally said, “All right, go ahead.” So Ahimaaz took the less demanding route by way of the plain and ran to Mahanaim ahead of the Ethiopian.",
      "24": "While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town, the watchman climbed to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked, he saw a lone man running toward them.",
      "25": "He shouted the news down to David, and the king replied, “If he is alone, he has news.” As the messenger came closer,",
      "26": "the watchman saw another man running toward them. He shouted down, “Here comes another one!” The king replied, “He also will have news.”",
      "27": "“The first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok,” the watchman said. “He is a good man and comes with good news,” the king replied.",
      "28": "Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, “Everything is all right!” He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Praise to the LORD your God, who has handed over the rebels who dared to stand against my lord the king.”",
      "29": "“What about young Absalom?” the king demanded. “Is he all right?” Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab told me to come, there was a lot of commotion. But I didn’t know what was happening.”",
      "30": "“Wait here,” the king told him. So Ahimaaz stepped aside.",
      "31": "Then the man from Ethiopia arrived and said, “I have good news for my lord the king. Today the LORD has rescued you from all those who rebelled against you.”",
      "32": "“What about young Absalom?” the king demanded. “Is he all right?” And the Ethiopian replied, “May all of your enemies, my lord the king, both now and in the future, share the fate of that young man!”",
      "33": "The king was overcome with emotion. He went up to the room over the gateway and burst into tears. And as he went, he cried, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you! O Absalom, my son, my son.”"
    },
    "19": {
      "1": "Word soon reached Joab that the king was weeping and mourning for Absalom.",
      "2": "As all the people heard of the king’s deep grief for his son, the joy of that day’s victory was turned into deep sadness.",
      "3": "They crept back into the town that day as though they were ashamed and had deserted in battle.",
      "4": "The king covered his face with his hands and kept on crying, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”",
      "5": "Then Joab went to the king’s room and said to him, “We saved your life today and the lives of your sons, your daughters, and your wives and concubines. Yet you act like this, making us feel ashamed of ourselves.",
      "6": "You seem to love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that your commanders and troops mean nothing to you. It seems that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died, you would be pleased.",
      "7": "Now go out there and congratulate your troops, for I swear by the LORD that if you don’t go out, not a single one of them will remain here tonight. Then you will be worse off than ever before.”",
      "8": "So the king went out and took his seat at the town gate, and as the news spread throughout the town that he was there, everyone went to him. Meanwhile, the Israelites who had supported Absalom fled to their homes.",
      "9": "And throughout all the tribes of Israel there was much discussion and argument going on. The people were saying, “The king rescued us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines, but Absalom chased him out of the country.",
      "10": "Now Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, is dead. Why not ask David to come back and be our king again?”",
      "11": "Then King David sent Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, to say to the elders of Judah, “Why are you the last ones to welcome back the king into his palace? For I have heard that all Israel is ready.",
      "12": "You are my relatives, my own tribe, my own flesh and blood! So why are you the last ones to welcome back the king?”",
      "13": "And David told them to tell Amasa, “Since you are my own flesh and blood, like Joab, may God strike me and even kill me if I do not appoint you as commander of my army in his place.”",
      "14": "Then Amasa convinced all the men of Judah, and they responded unanimously. They sent word to the king, “Return to us, and bring back all who are with you.”",
      "15": "So the king started back to Jerusalem. And when he arrived at the Jordan River, the people of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across the river.",
      "16": "Shimei son of Gera, the man from Bahurim in Benjamin, hurried across with the men of Judah to welcome King David.",
      "17": "A thousand other men from the tribe of Benjamin were with him, including Ziba, the chief servant of the house of Saul, and Ziba’s fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed down to the Jordan to meet the king.",
      "18": "They crossed the shallows of the Jordan to bring the king’s household across the river, helping him in every way they could. As the king was about to cross the river, Shimei fell down before him.",
      "19": "“My lord the king, please forgive me,” he pleaded. “Forget the terrible thing your servant did when you left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind.",
      "20": "I know how much I sinned. That is why I have come here today, the very first person in all Israel to greet my lord the king.”",
      "21": "Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shimei should die, for he cursed the LORD’s anointed king!”",
      "22": "“Who asked your opinion, you sons of Zeruiah!” David exclaimed. “Why have you become my adversary today? This is not a day for execution, for today I am once again the king of Israel!”",
      "23": "Then, turning to Shimei, David vowed, “Your life will be spared.”",
      "24": "Now Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, came down from Jerusalem to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet, trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes since the day the king left Jerusalem.",
      "25": "“Why didn’t you come with me, Mephibosheth?” the king asked him.",
      "26": "Mephibosheth replied, “My lord the king, my servant Ziba deceived me. I told him, ‘Saddle my donkey so I can go with the king.’ For as you know I am crippled.",
      "27": "Ziba has slandered me by saying that I refused to come. But I know that my lord the king is like an angel of God, so do what you think is best.",
      "28": "All my relatives and I could expect only death from you, my lord, but instead you have honored me by allowing me to eat at your own table! What more can I ask?”",
      "29": "“You’ve said enough,” David replied. “I’ve decided that you and Ziba will divide your land equally between you.”",
      "30": "“Give him all of it,” Mephibosheth said. “I am content just to have you safely back again, my lord the king!”",
      "31": "Barzillai of Gilead had come down from Rogelim to escort the king across the Jordan.",
      "32": "He was very old—eighty years of age—and very wealthy. He was the one who had provided food for the king during his stay in Mahanaim.",
      "33": "“Come across with me and live in Jerusalem,” the king said to Barzillai. “I will take care of you there.”",
      "34": "“No,” he replied, “I am far too old to go with the king to Jerusalem.",
      "35": "I am eighty years old today, and I can no longer enjoy anything. Food and wine are no longer tasty, and I cannot hear the singers as they sing. I would only be a burden to my lord the king.",
      "36": "Just to go across the Jordan River with the king is all the honor I need!",
      "37": "Then let me return again to die in my own town, where my father and mother are buried. But here is your servant, my son Kimham. Let him go with my lord the king and receive whatever you want to give him.”",
      "38": "“Good,” the king agreed. “Kimham will go with me, and I will help him in any way you would like. And I will do for you anything you want.”",
      "39": "So all the people crossed the Jordan with the king. After David had blessed Barzillai and kissed him, Barzillai returned to his own home.",
      "40": "The king then crossed over to Gilgal, taking Kimham with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king on his way.",

      "23": "He made two cherubim of wild olive wood, each 15 feet tall, and placed them in the inner sanctuary.",
      "24": "The wingspan of each of the cherubim was 15 feet, each wing being 7 1 / 2 feet long.",
      "25": "The two cherubim were identical in shape and size;",
      "26": "each was 15 feet tall.",
      "27": "He placed them side by side in the inner sanctuary of the Temple. Their outspread wings reached from wall to wall, while their inner wings touched at the center of the room.",
      "28": "He overlaid the two cherubim with gold.",
      "29": "He decorated all the walls of the inner sanctuary and the main room with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.",

      "31": "For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made double doors of wild olive wood with five-sided doorposts.",
      "32": "These double doors were decorated with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. The doors, including the decorations of cherubim and palm trees, were overlaid with gold.",
      "33": "Then he made four-sided doorposts of wild olive wood for the entrance to the Temple.",
      "34": "There were two folding doors of cypress wood, and each door was hinged to fold back upon itself.",
      "35": "These doors were decorated with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers—all overlaid evenly with gold.",

      "37": "The foundation of the LORD’s Temple was laid in midspring, in the month of Ziv, during the fourth year of Solomon’s reign.",
      "38": "The entire building was completed in every detail by midautumn, in the month of Bul, during the eleventh year of his reign. So it took seven years to build the Temple."

      "3": "The hall had a cedar roof. Above the beams on the pillars were forty-five side rooms, arranged in three tiers of fifteen each.",
      "4": "On each end of the long hall were three rows of windows facing each other.",
      "5": "All the doorways and doorposts had rectangular frames and were arranged in sets of three, facing each other.",
      "6": "Solomon also built the Hall of Pillars, which was 75 feet long and 45 feet wide. There was a porch in front, along with a canopy supported by pillars.",
      "7": "Solomon also built the throne room, known as the Hall of Justice, where he sat to hear legal matters. It was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling.",
      "8": "Solomon’s living quarters surrounded a courtyard behind this hall, and they were constructed the same way. He also built similar living quarters for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.",
      "9": "From foundation to eaves, all these buildings were built from huge blocks of high-quality stone, cut with saws and trimmed to exact measure on all sides.",
      "10": "Some of the huge foundation stones were 15 feet long, and some were 12 feet long.",
      "11": "The blocks of high-quality stone used in the walls were also cut to measure, and cedar beams were also used.",
      "12": "The walls of the great courtyard were built so that there was one layer of cedar beams between every three layers of finished stone, just like the walls of the inner courtyard of the LORD’s Temple with its entry room.",
      "13": "King Solomon then asked for a man named Huram to come from Tyre.",
      "14": "He was half Israelite, since his mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father had been a craftsman in bronze from Tyre. Huram was extremely skillful and talented in any work in bronze, and he came to do all the metal work for King Solomon.",
      "15": "Huram cast two bronze pillars, each 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference.",
      "16": "For the tops of the pillars he cast bronze capitals, each 7 1 / 2 feet tall.",
      "17": "Each capital was decorated with seven sets of latticework and interwoven chains.",
      "18": "He also encircled the latticework with two rows of pomegranates to decorate the capitals over the pillars.",

      "20": "The capitals on the two pillars had 200 pomegranates in two rows around them, beside the rounded surface next to the latticework.",
      "21": "Huram set the pillars at the entrance of the Temple, one toward the south and one toward the north. He named the one on the south Jakin, and the one on the north Boaz.",
      "22": "The capitals on the pillars were shaped like water lilies. And so the work on the pillars was finished.",
      "23": "Then Huram cast a great round basin, 15 feet across from rim to rim, called the Sea. It was 7 1 / 2 feet deep and about 45 feet in circumference.",
      "24": "It was encircled just below its rim by two rows of decorative gourds. There were about six gourds per foot all the way around, and they were cast as part of the basin.",
      "25": "The Sea was placed on a base of twelve bronze oxen, all facing outward. Three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east, and the Sea rested on them.",
      "26": "The walls of the Sea were about three inches thick, and its rim flared out like a cup and resembled a water lily blossom. It could hold about 11,000 gallons of water.",
      "27": "Huram also made ten bronze water carts, each 6 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 4 1 / 2 feet tall.",
      "28": "They were constructed with side panels braced with crossbars.",
      "29": "Both the panels and the crossbars were decorated with carved lions, oxen, and cherubim. Above and below the lions and oxen were wreath decorations.",

      "31": "The top of each cart had a rounded frame for the basin. It projected 1 1 / 2 feet above the cart’s top like a round pedestal, and its opening was 2 1 / 4 feet across; it was decorated on the outside with carvings of wreaths. The panels of the carts were square, not round.",
      "32": "Under the panels were four wheels that were connected to axles that had been cast as one unit with the cart. The wheels were 2 1 / 4 feet in diameter",
      "33": "and were similar to chariot wheels. The axles, spokes, rims, and hubs were all cast from molten bronze.",
      "34": "There were handles at each of the four corners of the carts, and these, too, were cast as one unit with the cart.",
      "35": "Around the top of each cart was a rim nine inches wide. The corner supports and side panels were cast as one unit with the cart.",
      "36": "Carvings of cherubim, lions, and palm trees decorated the panels and corner supports wherever there was room, and there were wreaths all around.",
      "37": "All ten water carts were the same size and were made alike, for each was cast from the same mold.",
      "38": "Huram also made ten smaller bronze basins, one for each cart. Each basin was six feet across and could hold 220 gallons of water.",
      "39": "He set five water carts on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. The great bronze basin called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple.",
      "40": "He also made the necessary washbasins, shovels, and bowls. So at last Huram completed everything King Solomon had assigned him to make for the Temple of the LORD:",

      "42": "the 400 pomegranates that hung from the chains on the capitals (two rows of pomegranates for each of the chain networks that decorated the capitals on top of the pillars);",
      "43": "the ten water carts holding the ten basins;",
      "44": "the Sea and the twelve oxen under it;",
      "45": "the ash buckets, the shovels, and the bowls. Huram made all these things of burnished bronze for the Temple of the LORD, just as King Solomon had directed.",
      "46": "The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan.",
      "47": "Solomon did not weigh all these things because there were so many; the weight of the bronze could not be measured.",
      "48": "Solomon also made all the furnishings of the Temple of the LORD: the gold altar; the gold table for the Bread of the Presence;",
      "49": "the lampstands of solid gold, five on the south and five on the north, in front of the Most Holy Place; the flower decorations, lamps, and tongs—all of gold;",

      "51": "So King Solomon finished all his work on the Temple of the LORD. Then he brought all the gifts his father, David, had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and the various articles—and he stored them in the treasuries of the LORD’s Temple."

      "3": "That same day the man of God gave a sign to prove his message. He said, “The LORD has promised to give this sign: This altar will split apart, and its ashes will be poured out on the ground.”",

      "31": "Afterward the prophet said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.",

      "6": "“I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or trade it, but he refused!” Ahab told her.",
      "7": "“Are you the king of Israel or not?” Jezebel demanded. “Get up and eat something, and don’t worry about it. I’ll get you Naboth’s vineyard!”",

      "6": "The courtyard was beautifully decorated with white cotton curtains and blue hangings, which were fastened with white linen cords and purple ribbons to silver rings embedded in marble pillars. Gold and silver couches stood on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones.",
      "7": "Drinks were served in gold goblets of many designs, and there was an abundance of royal wine, reflecting the king’s generosity.",

      "11": "to bring Queen Vashti to him with the royal crown on her head. He wanted the nobles and all the other men to gaze on her beauty, for she was a very beautiful woman.",
      "12": "But when they conveyed the king’s order to Queen Vashti, she refused to come. This made the king furious, and he burned with anger.",

      "12": "Before each young woman was taken to the king’s bed, she was given the prescribed twelve months of beauty treatments—six months with oil of myrrh, followed by six months with special perfumes and ointments.",
      "13": "When it was time for her to go to the king’s palace, she was given her choice of whatever clothing or jewelry she wanted to take from the harem.",

There she would be under the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of the concubines. She would never go to the king again unless he had especially enjoyed her and requested her by name.",
      "15": "Esther was the daughter of Abihail, who was Mordecai’s uncle. (Mordecai had adopted his younger cousin Esther.) When it was Esther’s turn to go to the king, she accepted the advice of Hegai, the eunuch in charge of the harem. She asked for nothing except what he suggested, and she was admired by everyone who saw her.",
      "16": "Esther was taken to King Xerxes at the royal palace in early winter of the seventh year of his reign.",
      "17": "And the king loved Esther more than any of the other young women. He was so delighted with her that he set the royal crown on her head and declared her queen instead of Vashti.",
      "18": "To celebrate the occasion, he gave a great banquet in Esther’s honor for all his nobles and officials, declaring a public holiday for the provinces and giving generous gifts to everyone.",
      "19": "Even after all the young women had been transferred to the second harem and Mordecai had become a palace official,",

      "22": "But Mordecai heard about the plot and gave the information to Queen Esther. She then told the king about it and gave Mordecai credit for the report.",

      "2": "All the king’s officials would bow down before Haman to show him respect whenever he passed by, for so the king had commanded. But Mordecai refused to bow down or show him respect.",
      "3": "Then the palace officials at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you disobeying the king’s command?”",
      "4": "They spoke to him day after day, but still he refused to comply with the order. So they spoke to Haman about this to see if he would tolerate Mordecai’s conduct, since Mordecai had told them he was a Jew.",
      "5": "When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down or show him respect, he was filled with rage.",
      "6": "He had learned of Mordecai’s nationality, so he decided it was not enough to lay hands on Mordecai alone. Instead, he looked for a way to destroy all the Jews throughout the entire empire of Xerxes.",
      "7": "So in the month of April, during the twelfth year of King Xerxes’ reign, lots were cast in Haman’s presence (the lots were called purim ) to determine the best day and month to take action. And the day selected was March 7, nearly a year later.",
      "8": "Then Haman approached King Xerxes and said, “There is a certain race of people scattered through all the provinces of your empire who keep themselves separate from everyone else. Their laws are different from those of any other people, and they refuse to obey the laws of the king. So it is not in the king’s interest to let them live.",
      "9": "If it please the king, issue a decree that they be destroyed, and I will give 10,000 large sacks of silver to the government administrators to be deposited in the royal treasury.”",

      "11": "The king said, “The money and the people are both yours to do with as you see fit.”",
      "12": "So on April 17 the king’s secretaries were summoned, and a decree was written exactly as Haman dictated. It was sent to the king’s highest officers, the governors of the respective provinces, and the nobles of each province in their own scripts and languages. The decree was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the king’s signet ring.",
      "13": "Dispatches were sent by swift messengers into all the provinces of the empire, giving the order that all Jews—young and old, including women and children—must be killed, slaughtered, and annihilated on a single day. This was scheduled to happen on March 7 of the next year. The property of the Jews would be given to those who killed them.",
      "14": "A copy of this decree was to be issued as law in every province and proclaimed to all peoples, so that they would be ready to do their duty on the appointed day.",
      "15": "At the king’s command, the decree went out by swift messengers, and it was also proclaimed in the fortress of Susa. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa fell into confusion."

    "4": {
      "1": "When Mordecai learned about all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on burlap and ashes, and went out into the city, crying with a loud and bitter wail.",
      "2": "He went as far as the gate of the palace, for no one was allowed to enter the palace gate while wearing clothes of mourning.",
      "3": "And as news of the king’s decree reached all the provinces, there was great mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, and wailed, and many people lay in burlap and ashes.",
      "4": "When Queen Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she was deeply distressed. She sent clothing to him to replace the burlap, but he refused it.",
      "5": "Then Esther sent for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs who had been appointed as her attendant. She ordered him to go to Mordecai and find out what was troubling him and why he was in mourning.",
      "6": "So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the square in front of the palace gate.",
      "7": "Mordecai told him the whole story, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.",
      "8": "Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the decree issued in Susa that called for the death of all Jews. He asked Hathach to show it to Esther and explain the situation to her. He also asked Hathach to direct her to go to the king to beg for mercy and plead for her people.",
      "9": "So Hathach returned to Esther with Mordecai’s message.",
      "10": "Then Esther told Hathach to go back and relay this message to Mordecai:",
      "11": "“All the king’s officials and even the people in the provinces know that anyone who appears before the king in his inner court without being invited is doomed to die unless the king holds out his gold scepter. And the king has not called for me to come to him for thirty days.”",
      "12": "So Hathach gave Esther’s message to Mordecai.",
      "13": "Mordecai sent this reply to Esther: “Don’t think for a moment that because you’re in the palace you will escape when all other Jews are killed.",
      "14": "If you keep quiet at a time like this, deliverance and relief for the Jews will arise from some other place, but you and your relatives will die. Who knows if perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as this?”",
      "15": "Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:",
      "16": "“Go and gather together all the Jews of Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will do the same. And then, though it is against the law, I will go in to see the king. If I must die, I must die.”",

      "6": "For how can I endure to see my people and my family slaughtered and destroyed?”",

      "9": "So on June 25 the king’s secretaries were summoned, and a decree was written exactly as Mordecai dictated. It was sent to the Jews and to the highest officers, the governors, and the nobles of all the 127 provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia. The decree was written in the scripts and languages of all the peoples of the empire, including that of the Jews.",
      "10": "The decree was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the king’s signet ring. Mordecai sent the dispatches by swift messengers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king’s service.",
      "11": "The king’s decree gave the Jews in every city authority to unite to defend their lives. They were allowed to kill, slaughter, and annihilate anyone of any nationality or province who might attack them or their children and wives, and to take the property of their enemies.",
      "12": "The day chosen for this event throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes was March 7 of the next year.",
      "13": "A copy of this decree was to be issued as law in every province and proclaimed to all peoples, so that the Jews would be ready to take revenge on their enemies on the appointed day.",
      "14": "So urged on by the king’s command, the messengers rode out swiftly on fast horses bred for the king’s service. The same decree was also proclaimed in the fortress of Susa.",

If they have done that here, what has happened in the rest of the provinces? But now, what more do you want? It will be granted to you; tell me and I will do it.”",

      "25": "But when Esther came before the king, he issued a decree causing Haman’s evil plot to backfire, and Haman and his sons were impaled on a sharpened pole.",
      "26": "That is why this celebration is called Purim, because it is the ancient word for casting lots. So because of Mordecai’s letter and because of what they had experienced,",
      "27": "the Jews throughout the realm agreed to inaugurate this tradition and to pass it on to their descendants and to all who became Jews. They declared they would never fail to celebrate these two prescribed days at the appointed time each year.",
      "28": "These days would be remembered and kept from generation to generation and celebrated by every family throughout the provinces and cities of the empire. This Festival of Purim would never cease to be celebrated among the Jews, nor would the memory of what happened ever die out among their descendants.",
      "29": "Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote another letter putting the queen’s full authority behind Mordecai’s letter to establish the Festival of Purim.",
      "30": "Letters wishing peace and security were sent to the Jews throughout the 127 provinces of the empire of Xerxes.",
      "31": "These letters established the Festival of Purim—an annual celebration of these days at the appointed time, decreed by both Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther. (The people decided to observe this festival, just as they had decided for themselves and their descendants to establish the times of fasting and mourning.)",

Seven periods of time will pass while you live this way, until you learn that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of the world and gives them to anyone he chooses.’",
      "33": "“That same hour the judgment was fulfilled, and Nebuchadnezzar was driven from human society. He ate grass like a cow, and he was drenched with the dew of heaven. He lived this way until his hair was as long as eagles’ feathers and his nails were like birds’ claws.",

He said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever can read this writing and tell me what it means will be dressed in purple robes of royal honor and will have a gold chain placed around his neck. He will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom!”",

      "11": "There is a man in your kingdom who has within him the spirit of the holy gods. During Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, this man was found to have insight, understanding, and wisdom like that of the gods. Your predecessor, the king—your predecessor King Nebuchadnezzar—made him chief over all the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and fortune-tellers of Babylon.",

If you can read these words and tell me their meaning, you will be clothed in purple robes of royal honor, and you will have a gold chain placed around your neck.

You and your nobles and your wives and concubines have been drinking wine from them while praising gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone—gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything at all. But you have not honored the God who gives you the breath of life and controls your destiny!",

      "25": "“This is the message that was written: Mene, Mene, Tekel , and Parsin .",
      "26": "This is what these words mean: Mene means ‘numbered’—God has numbered the days of your reign and has brought it to an end.",

      "3": "Daniel soon proved himself more capable than all the other administrators and high officers. Because of Daniel’s great ability, the king made plans to place him over the entire empire.",
      "4": "Then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way Daniel was handling government affairs, but they couldn’t find anything to criticize or condemn. He was faithful, always responsible, and completely trustworthy.",
      "5": "So they concluded, “Our only chance of finding grounds for accusing Daniel will be in connection with the rules of his religion.”",

      "7": "We are all in agreement—we administrators, officials, high officers, advisers, and governors—that the king should make a law that will be strictly enforced. Give orders that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human—except to you, Your Majesty—will be thrown into the den of lions.",
      "8": "And now, Your Majesty, issue and sign this law so it cannot be changed, an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked.”",

      "11": "Then the officials went together to Daniel’s house and found him praying and asking for God’s help.",
      "12": "So they went straight to the king and reminded him about his law. “Did you not sign a law that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human—except to you, Your Majesty—will be thrown into the den of lions?” “Yes,” the king replied, “that decision stands; it is an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked.”",

      "17": "A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed the stone with his own royal seal and the seals of his nobles, so that no one could rescue Daniel.",
      "18": "Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night fasting. He refused his usual entertainment and couldn’t sleep at all that night.",
      "19": "Very early the next morning, the king got up and hurried out to the lions’ den.",
      "20": "When he got there, he called out in anguish, “Daniel, servant of the living God! Was your God, whom you serve so faithfully, able to rescue you from the lions?”",
      "21": "Daniel answered, “Long live the king!",
      "22": "My God sent his angel to shut the lions’ mouths so that they would not hurt me, for I have been found innocent in his sight. And I have not wronged you, Your Majesty.”",
      "23": "The king was overjoyed and ordered that Daniel be lifted from the den. Not a scratch was found on him, for he had trusted in his God.",
      "24": "Then the king gave orders to arrest the men who had maliciously accused Daniel. He had them thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives and children. The lions leaped on them and tore them apart before they even hit the floor of the den.",

      "5": "Then I saw a second beast, and it looked like a bear. It was rearing up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And I heard a voice saying to it, “Get up! Devour the flesh of many people!”",
      "6": "Then the third of these strange beasts appeared, and it looked like a leopard. It had four bird’s wings on its back, and it had four heads. Great authority was given to this beast.",
      "7": "Then in my vision that night, I saw a fourth beast—terrifying, dreadful, and very strong. It devoured and crushed its victims with huge iron teeth and trampled their remains beneath its feet. It was different from any of the other beasts, and it had ten horns.",
      "8": "As I was looking at the horns, suddenly another small horn appeared among them. Three of the first horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it. This little horn had eyes like human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly.",
      "9": "I watched as thrones were put in place and the Ancient One sat down to judge. His clothing was as white as snow, his hair like purest wool. He sat on a fiery throne with wheels of blazing fire,",
      "10": "and a river of fire was pouring out, flowing from his presence. Millions of angels ministered to him; many millions stood to attend him. Then the court began its session, and the books were opened.",
      "11": "I continued to watch because I could hear the little horn’s boastful speech. I kept watching until the fourth beast was killed and its body was destroyed by fire.",
      "12": "The other three beasts had their authority taken from them, but they were allowed to live a while longer.",
      "13": "As my vision continued that night, I saw someone like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient One and was led into his presence.",
      "14": "He was given authority, honor, and sovereignty over all the nations of the world, so that people of every race and nation and language would obey him. His rule is eternal—it will never end. His kingdom will never be destroyed.",

      "18": "But in the end, the holy people of the Most High will be given the kingdom, and they will rule forever and ever.”",

      "20": "I also asked about the ten horns on the fourth beast’s head and the little horn that came up afterward and destroyed three of the other horns. This horn had seemed greater than the others, and it had human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly.",
      "21": "As I watched, this horn was waging war against God’s holy people and was defeating them,",
      "22": "until the Ancient One—the Most High—came and judged in favor of his holy people. Then the time arrived for the holy people to take over the kingdom.",
      "23": "Then he said to me, “This fourth beast is the fourth world power that will rule the earth. It will be different from all the others. It will devour the whole world, trampling and crushing everything in its path.",
      "24": "Its ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king will arise, different from the other ten, who will subdue three of them.",
      "25": "He will defy the Most High and oppress the holy people of the Most High. He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws, and they will be placed under his control for a time, times, and half a time.",

      "10": "Its power reached to the heavens, where it attacked the heavenly army, throwing some of the heavenly beings and some of the stars to the ground and trampling them.",
      "11": "It even challenged the Commander of heaven’s army by canceling the daily sacrifices offered to him and by destroying his Temple.",
      "12": "The army of heaven was restrained from responding to this rebellion. So the daily sacrifice was halted, and truth was overthrown. The horn succeeded in everything it did.",
      "13": "Then I heard two holy ones talking to each other. One of them asked, “How long will the events of this vision last? How long will the rebellion that causes desecration stop the daily sacrifices? How long will the Temple and heaven’s army be trampled on?”",

      "18": "While he was speaking, I fainted and lay there with my face to the ground. But Gabriel roused me with a touch and helped me to my feet.",

      "23": "“At the end of their rule, when their sin is at its height, a fierce king, a master of intrigue, will rise to power.",
      "24": "He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause a shocking amount of destruction and succeed in everything he does. He will destroy powerful leaders and devastate the holy people.",

      "20": "When it was evening, Jesus sat down at the table with the Twelve.",
      "21": "While they were eating, he said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”",
      "22": "Greatly distressed, each one asked in turn, “Am I the one, Lord?”",
      "23": "He replied, “One of you who has just eaten from this bowl with me will betray me.",
      "24": "For the Son of Man must die, as the Scriptures declared long ago. But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him. It would be far better for that man if he had never been born!”",
      "25": "Judas, the one who would betray him, also asked, “Rabbi, am I the one?” And Jesus told him, “You have said it.”",
      "26": "As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take this and eat it, for this is my body.”",
      "27": "And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, “Each of you drink from it,",
      "28": "for this is my blood, which confirms the covenant between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many.",
      "29": "Mark my words—I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”",
      "30": "Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.",
      "31": "On the way, Jesus told them, “Tonight all of you will desert me. For the Scriptures say, ‘God will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’",
      "32": "But after I have been raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there.”",
      "33": "Peter declared, “Even if everyone else deserts you, I will never desert you.”",
      "34": "Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, Peter—this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me.”",
      "35": "“No!” Peter insisted. “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the other disciples vowed the same.",
      "36": "Then Jesus went with them to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and he said, “Sit here while I go over there to pray.”",
      "37": "He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, James and John, and he became anguished and distressed.",
      "38": "He told them, “My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”",
      "39": "He went on a little farther and bowed with his face to the ground, praying, “My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine.”",
      "40": "Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, “Couldn’t you watch with me even one hour?",
      "41": "Keep watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak!”",
      "42": "Then Jesus left them a second time and prayed, “My Father! If this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will be done.”",
      "43": "When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open.",
      "44": "So he went to pray a third time, saying the same things again.",
      "45": "Then he came to the disciples and said, “Go ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But look—the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
      "46": "Up, let’s be going. Look, my betrayer is here!”",
      "47": "And even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the leading priests and elders of the people.",
      "48": "The traitor, Judas, had given them a prearranged signal: “You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss.”",
      "49": "So Judas came straight to Jesus. “Greetings, Rabbi!” he exclaimed and gave him the kiss.",
      "50": "Jesus said, “My friend, go ahead and do what you have come for.” Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him.",
      "51": "But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest’s slave, slashing off his ear.",
      "52": "“Put away your sword,” Jesus told him. “Those who use the sword will die by the sword.",
      "53": "Don’t you realize that I could ask my Father for thousands of angels to protect us, and he would send them instantly?",
      "54": "But if I did, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that describe what must happen now?”",
      "55": "Then Jesus said to the crowd, “Am I some dangerous revolutionary, that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me? Why didn’t you arrest me in the Temple? I was there teaching every day.",
      "56": "But this is all happening to fulfill the words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures.” At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled.",
      "57": "Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of religious law and the elders had gathered.",
      "58": "Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and came to the high priest’s courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards and waited to see how it would all end.",
      "59": "Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council were trying to find witnesses who would lie about Jesus, so they could put him to death.",
      "60": "But even though they found many who agreed to give false witness, they could not use anyone’s testimony. Finally, two men came forward",
      "61": "who declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”",
      "62": "Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Well, aren’t you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?”",
      "63": "But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I demand in the name of the living God—tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”",
      "64": "Jesus replied, “You have said it. And in the future you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God’s right hand and coming on the clouds of heaven.”",
      "65": "Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, “Blasphemy! Why do we need other witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy.",
      "66": "What is your verdict?” “Guilty!” they shouted. “He deserves to die!”",
      "67": "Then they began to spit in Jesus’ face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him,",
      "68": "jeering, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you that time?”",
      "69": "Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came over and said to him, “You were one of those with Jesus the Galilean.”",
      "70": "But Peter denied it in front of everyone. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.",
      "71": "Later, out by the gate, another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”",
      "72": "Again Peter denied it, this time with an oath. “I don’t even know the man,” he said.",
      "73": "A little later some of the other bystanders came over to Peter and said, “You must be one of them; we can tell by your Galilean accent.”",
      "74": "Peter swore, “A curse on me if I’m lying—I don’t know the man!” And immediately the rooster crowed.",
      "75": "Suddenly, Jesus’ words flashed through Peter’s mind: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me.” And he went away, weeping bitterly."

      "30": "And when she arrived home, she found her little girl lying quietly in bed, and the demon was gone.",
      "31": "Jesus left Tyre and went up to Sidon before going back to the Sea of Galilee and the region of the Ten Towns.",
      "32": "A deaf man with a speech impediment was brought to him, and the people begged Jesus to lay his hands on the man to heal him.",
      "33": "Jesus led him away from the crowd so they could be alone. He put his fingers into the man’s ears. Then, spitting on his own fingers, he touched the man’s tongue.",
      "34": "Looking up to heaven, he sighed and said, “Ephphatha,” which means, “Be opened!”",
      "35": "Instantly the man could hear perfectly, and his tongue was freed so he could speak plainly!",
      "36": "Jesus told the crowd not to tell anyone, but the more he told them not to, the more they spread the news.",
      "37": "They were completely amazed and said again and again, “Everything he does is wonderful. He even makes the deaf to hear and gives speech to those who cannot speak.”"

      "1": "About this time another large crowd had gathered, and the people ran out of food again. Jesus called his disciples and told them,",
      "2": "“I feel sorry for these people. They have been here with me for three days, and they have nothing left to eat.",
      "3": "If I send them home hungry, they will faint along the way. For some of them have come a long distance.”",
      "4": "His disciples replied, “How are we supposed to find enough food to feed them out here in the wilderness?”",
      "5": "Jesus asked, “How much bread do you have?” “Seven loaves,” they replied.",
      "6": "So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. He gave them to his disciples, who distributed the bread to the crowd.",
      "7": "A few small fish were found, too, so Jesus also blessed these and told the disciples to distribute them.",
      "8": "They ate as much as they wanted. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food.",
      "9": "There were about 4,000 men in the crowd that day, and Jesus sent them home after they had eaten.",
      "10": "Immediately after this, he got into a boat with his disciples and crossed over to the region of Dalmanutha.",
      "11": "When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had arrived, they came and started to argue with him. Testing him, they demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.",
      "12": "When he heard this, he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, “Why do these people keep demanding a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, I will not give this generation any such sign.”",
      "13": "So he got back into the boat and left them, and he crossed to the other side of the lake.",
      "14": "But the disciples had forgotten to bring any food. They had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat.",
      "15": "As they were crossing the lake, Jesus warned them, “Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod.”",
      "16": "At this they began to argue with each other because they hadn’t brought any bread.",
      "17": "Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, “Why are you arguing about having no bread? Don’t you know or understand even yet? Are your hearts too hard to take it in?",
      "18": "‘You have eyes—can’t you see? You have ears—can’t you hear?’ Don’t you remember anything at all?",
      "19": "When I fed the 5,000 with five loaves of bread, how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up afterward?” “Twelve,” they said.",
      "20": "“And when I fed the 4,000 with seven loaves, how many large baskets of leftovers did you pick up?” “Seven,” they said.",

      "24": "The man looked around. “Yes,” he said, “I see people, but I can’t see them very clearly. They look like trees walking around.”",
      "25": "Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again, and his eyes were opened. His sight was completely restored, and he could see everything clearly.",
      "26": "Jesus sent him away, saying, “Don’t go back into the village on your way home.”",
      "27": "Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along, he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”",
      "28": "“Well,” they replied, “some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other prophets.”",
      "29": "Then he asked them, “But who do you say I am?” Peter replied, “You are the Messiah.”",
      "30": "But Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.",
      "31": "Then Jesus began to tell them that the Son of Man must suffer many terrible things and be rejected by the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but three days later he would rise from the dead.",
      "32": "As he talked about this openly with his disciples, Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him for saying such things.",
      "33": "Jesus turned around and looked at his disciples, then reprimanded Peter. “Get away from me, Satan!” he said. “You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God’s.”",
      "34": "Then, calling the crowd to join his disciples, he said, “If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross, and follow me.",
      "35": "If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, you will save it.",
      "36": "And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?",
      "37": "Is anything worth more than your soul?",
      "38": "If anyone is ashamed of me and my message in these adulterous and sinful days, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”"

      "2": "Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone. As the men watched, Jesus’ appearance was transformed,",
      "3": "and his clothes became dazzling white, far whiter than any earthly bleach could ever make them.",
      "4": "Then Elijah and Moses appeared and began talking with Jesus.",
      "5": "Peter exclaimed, “Rabbi, it’s wonderful for us to be here! Let’s make three shelters as memorials—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”",
      "6": "He said this because he didn’t really know what else to say, for they were all terrified.",
      "7": "Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my dearly loved Son. Listen to him.”",
      "8": "Suddenly, when they looked around, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus with them.",
      "9": "As they went back down the mountain, he told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.",
      "10": "So they kept it to themselves, but they often asked each other what he meant by “rising from the dead.”",
      "11": "Then they asked him, “Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes?”",
      "12": "Jesus responded, “Elijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready. Yet why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man must suffer greatly and be treated with utter contempt?",
      "13": "But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they chose to abuse him, just as the Scriptures predicted.”",
      "14": "When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd surrounding them, and some teachers of religious law were arguing with them.",
      "15": "When the crowd saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with awe, and they ran to greet him.",
      "16": "“What is all this arguing about?” Jesus asked.",
      "17": "One of the men in the crowd spoke up and said, “Teacher, I brought my son so you could heal him. He is possessed by an evil spirit that won’t let him talk.",
      "18": "And whenever this spirit seizes him, it throws him violently to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast out the evil spirit, but they couldn’t do it.”",
      "19": "Jesus said to them, “You faithless people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”",
      "20": "So they brought the boy. But when the evil spirit saw Jesus, it threw the child into a violent convulsion, and he fell to the ground, writhing and foaming at the mouth.",
      "21": "“How long has this been happening?” Jesus asked the boy’s father. He replied, “Since he was a little boy.",
      "22": "The spirit often throws him into the fire or into water, trying to kill him. Have mercy on us and help us, if you can.”",
      "23": "“What do you mean, ‘If I can’?” Jesus asked. “Anything is possible if a person believes.”",
      "24": "The father instantly cried out, “I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief!”",
      "25": "When Jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing, he rebuked the evil spirit. “Listen, you spirit that makes this boy unable to hear and speak,” he said. “I command you to come out of this child and never enter him again!”",
      "26": "Then the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him. The boy appeared to be dead. A murmur ran through the crowd as people said, “He’s dead.”",
      "27": "But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.",
      "28": "Afterward, when Jesus was alone in the house with his disciples, they asked him, “Why couldn’t we cast out that evil spirit?”",
      "29": "Jesus replied, “This kind can be cast out only by prayer.”",
      "30": "Leaving that region, they traveled through Galilee. Jesus didn’t want anyone to know he was there,",
      "31": "for he wanted to spend more time with his disciples and teach them. He said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies. He will be killed, but three days later he will rise from the dead.”",
      "32": "They didn’t understand what he was saying, however, and they were afraid to ask him what he meant.",
      "33": "After they arrived at Capernaum and settled in a house, Jesus asked his disciples, “What were you discussing out on the road?”",
      "34": "But they didn’t answer, because they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.",
      "35": "He sat down, called the twelve disciples over to him, and said, “Whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else.”",
      "36": "Then he put a little child among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them,",

      "43": "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It’s better to enter eternal life with only one hand than to go into the unquenchable fires of hell with two hands.",
      "45": "If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It’s better to enter eternal life with only one foot than to be thrown into hell with two feet.",
      "47": "And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out. It’s better to enter the Kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,",
