      "18": "Then the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him.”",
      "19": "So the LORD God formed from the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one.",

      "23": "“At last!” the man exclaimed. “This one is bone from my bone, and flesh from my flesh! She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken from ‘man.’”",

      "7": "At that moment their eyes were opened, and they suddenly felt shame at their nakedness. So they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.",

      "19": "When she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels, too, until they have had enough to drink.”",

      "32": "So the man went home with Laban, and Laban unloaded the camels, gave him straw for their bedding, fed them, and provided water for the man and the camel drivers to wash their feet.",

      "39": "“But I said to my master, ‘What if I can’t find a young woman who is willing to go back with me?’",

      "47": "“Then I asked, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel, and my grandparents are Nahor and Milcah.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.",
      "48": "“Then I bowed low and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master, Abraham, because he had led me straight to my master’s niece to be his son’s wife.",
      "49": "So tell me—will you or won’t you show unfailing love and faithfulness to my master? Please tell me yes or no, and then I’ll know what to do next.”",
      "50": "Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “The LORD has obviously brought you here, so there is nothing we can say.",
      "51": "Here is Rebekah; take her and go. Yes, let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has directed.”",
      "52": "When Abraham’s servant heard their answer, he bowed down to the ground and worshiped the LORD.",
      "53": "Then he brought out silver and gold jewelry and clothing and presented them to Rebekah. He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother.",

      "56": "But he said, “Don’t delay me. The LORD has made my mission successful; now send me back so I can return to my master.”",
      "57": "“Well,” they said, “we’ll call Rebekah and ask her what she thinks.”",
      "58": "So they called Rebekah. “Are you willing to go with this man?” they asked her. And she replied, “Yes, I will go.”",
      "59": "So they said good-bye to Rebekah and sent her away with Abraham’s servant and his men. The woman who had been Rebekah’s childhood nurse went along with her.",
      "60": "They gave her this blessing as she parted: “Our sister, may you become the mother of many millions! May your descendants be strong and conquer the cities of their enemies.”",
      "61": "Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the man. So Abraham’s servant took Rebekah and went on his way.",

      "18": "The next morning Jacob got up very early. He took the stone he had rested his head against, and he set it upright as a memorial pillar. Then he poured olive oil over it.",
      "19": "He named that place Bethel (which means “house of God”), although it was previously called Luz.",
      "20": "Then Jacob made this vow: “If God will indeed be with me and protect me on this journey, and if he will provide me with food and clothing,",
      "21": "and if I return safely to my father’s home, then the LORD will certainly be my God.",
      "22": "And this memorial pillar I have set up will become a place for worshiping God, and I will present to God a tenth of everything he gives me.”"

      "1": "Then Jacob hurried on, finally arriving in the land of the east.",
      "2": "He saw a well in the distance. Three flocks of sheep and goats lay in an open field beside it, waiting to be watered. But a heavy stone covered the mouth of the well.",
      "3": "It was the custom there to wait for all the flocks to arrive before removing the stone and watering the animals. Afterward the stone would be placed back over the mouth of the well.",
      "4": "Jacob went over to the shepherds and asked, “Where are you from, my friends?” “We are from Haran,” they answered.",
      "5": "“Do you know a man there named Laban, the grandson of Nahor?” he asked. “Yes, we do,” they replied.",
      "6": "“Is he doing well?” Jacob asked. “Yes, he’s well,” they answered. “Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the flock now.”",
      "7": "Jacob said, “Look, it’s still broad daylight—too early to round up the animals. Why don’t you water the sheep and goats so they can get back out to pasture?”",
      "8": "“We can’t water the animals until all the flocks have arrived,” they replied. “Then the shepherds move the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water all the sheep and goats.”",
      "9": "Jacob was still talking with them when Rachel arrived with her father’s flock, for she was a shepherd.",
      "10": "And because Rachel was his cousin—the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother—and because the sheep and goats belonged to his uncle Laban, Jacob went over to the well and moved the stone from its mouth and watered his uncle’s flock.",
      "11": "Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and he wept aloud.",
      "12": "He explained to Rachel that he was her cousin on her father’s side—the son of her aunt Rebekah. So Rachel quickly ran and told her father, Laban.",
      "13": "As soon as Laban heard that his nephew Jacob had arrived, he ran out to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him home. When Jacob had told him his story,",
      "14": "Laban exclaimed, “You really are my own flesh and blood!” After Jacob had stayed with Laban for about a month,",
      "15": "Laban said to him, “You shouldn’t work for me without pay just because we are relatives. Tell me how much your wages should be.”",
      "16": "Now Laban had two daughters. The older daughter was named Leah, and the younger one was Rachel.",
      "17": "There was no sparkle in Leah’s eyes, but Rachel had a beautiful figure and a lovely face.",
      "18": "Since Jacob was in love with Rachel, he told her father, “I’ll work for you for seven years if you’ll give me Rachel, your younger daughter, as my wife.”",
      "19": "“Agreed!” Laban replied. “I’d rather give her to you than to anyone else. Stay and work with me.”",
      "20": "So Jacob worked seven years to pay for Rachel. But his love for her was so strong that it seemed to him but a few days.",
      "21": "Finally, the time came for him to marry her. “I have fulfilled my agreement,” Jacob said to Laban. “Now give me my wife so I can sleep with her.”",
      "22": "So Laban invited everyone in the neighborhood and prepared a wedding feast.",
      "23": "But that night, when it was dark, Laban took Leah to Jacob, and he slept with her.",
      "24": "(Laban had given Leah a servant, Zilpah, to be her maid.)",
      "25": "But when Jacob woke up in the morning—it was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob raged at Laban. “I worked seven years for Rachel! Why have you tricked me?”",
      "26": "“It’s not our custom here to marry off a younger daughter ahead of the firstborn,” Laban replied.",
      "27": "“But wait until the bridal week is over; then we’ll give you Rachel, too—provided you promise to work another seven years for me.”",
      "28": "So Jacob agreed to work seven more years. A week after Jacob had married Leah, Laban gave him Rachel, too.",
      "29": "(Laban gave Rachel a servant, Bilhah, to be her maid.)",
      "30": "So Jacob slept with Rachel, too, and he loved her much more than Leah. He then stayed and worked for Laban the additional seven years.",
      "31": "When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to have children, but Rachel could not conceive.",
      "32": "So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “The LORD has noticed my misery, and now my husband will love me.”",
      "33": "She soon became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She named him Simeon, for she said, “The LORD heard that I was unloved and has given me another son.”",
      "34": "Then she became pregnant a third time and gave birth to another son. He was named Levi, for she said, “Surely this time my husband will feel affection for me, since I have given him three sons!”",
      "35": "Once again Leah became pregnant and gave birth to another son. She named him Judah, for she said, “Now I will praise the LORD!” And then she stopped having children."

      "3": "Then Rachel told him, “Take my maid, Bilhah, and sleep with her. She will bear children for me, and through her I can have a family, too.”",
      "4": "So Rachel gave her servant, Bilhah, to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her.",

      "9": "Meanwhile, Leah realized that she wasn’t getting pregnant anymore, so she took her servant, Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.",
      "10": "Soon Zilpah presented him with a son.",
      "11": "Leah named him Gad, for she said, “How fortunate I am!”",

      "13": "And Leah named him Asher, for she said, “What joy is mine! Now the other women will celebrate with me.”",
      "14": "One day during the wheat harvest, Reuben found some mandrakes growing in a field and brought them to his mother, Leah. Rachel begged Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”",
      "15": "But Leah angrily replied, “Wasn’t it enough that you stole my husband? Now will you steal my son’s mandrakes, too?” Rachel answered, “I will let Jacob sleep with you tonight if you give me some of the mandrakes.”",
      "16": "So that evening, as Jacob was coming home from the fields, Leah went out to meet him. “You must come and sleep with me tonight!” she said. “I have paid for you with some mandrakes that my son found.” So that night he slept with Leah.",
      "17": "And God answered Leah’s prayers. She became pregnant again and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob.",
      "18": "She named him Issachar, for she said, “God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband as a wife.”",
      "19": "Then Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob.",
      "20": "She named him Zebulun, for she said, “God has given me a good reward. Now my husband will treat me with respect, for I have given him six sons.”",
      "21": "Later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.",
      "22": "Then God remembered Rachel’s plight and answered her prayers by enabling her to have children.",

      "24": "And she named him Joseph, for she said, “May the LORD add yet another son to my family.”",

      "27": "“Please listen to me,” Laban replied. “I have become wealthy, for the LORD has blessed me because of you.",
      "28": "Tell me how much I owe you. Whatever it is, I’ll pay it.”",
      "29": "Jacob replied, “You know how hard I’ve worked for you, and how your flocks and herds have grown under my care.",
      "30": "You had little indeed before I came, but your wealth has increased enormously. The LORD has blessed you through everything I’ve done. But now, what about me? When can I start providing for my own family?”",
      "31": "“What wages do you want?” Laban asked again. Jacob replied, “Don’t give me anything. Just do this one thing, and I’ll continue to tend and watch over your flocks.",
      "32": "Let me inspect your flocks today and remove all the sheep and goats that are speckled or spotted, along with all the black sheep. Give these to me as my wages.",
      "33": "In the future, when you check on the animals you have given me as my wages, you’ll see that I have been honest. If you find in my flock any goats without speckles or spots, or any sheep that are not black, you will know that I have stolen them from you.”",
      "34": "“All right,” Laban replied. “It will be as you say.”",
      "35": "But that very day Laban went out and removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted or had white patches, and all the black sheep. He placed them in the care of his own sons,",
      "36": "who took them a three-days’ journey from where Jacob was. Meanwhile, Jacob stayed and cared for the rest of Laban’s flock.",
      "37": "Then Jacob took some fresh branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled off strips of bark, making white streaks on them.",
      "38": "Then he placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, for that was where they mated.",
      "39": "And when they mated in front of the white-streaked branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.",
      "40": "Jacob separated those lambs from Laban’s flock. And at mating time he turned the flock to face Laban’s animals that were streaked or black. This is how he built his own flock instead of increasing Laban’s.",
      "41": "Whenever the stronger females were ready to mate, Jacob would place the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of them. Then they would mate in front of the branches.",
      "42": "But he didn’t do this with the weaker ones, so the weaker lambs belonged to Laban, and the stronger ones were Jacob’s.",
      "43": "As a result, Jacob became very wealthy, with large flocks of sheep and goats, female and male servants, and many camels and donkeys."

      "3": "Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your father and grandfather and to your relatives there, and I will be with you.”",
      "4": "So Jacob called Rachel and Leah out to the field where he was watching his flock.",
      "5": "He said to them, “I have noticed that your father’s attitude toward me has changed. But the God of my father has been with me.",

      "7": "but he has cheated me, changing my wages ten times. But God has not allowed him to do me any harm.",
      "8": "For if he said, ‘The speckled animals will be your wages,’ the whole flock began to produce speckled young. And when he changed his mind and said, ‘The striped animals will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced striped young.",
      "9": "In this way, God has taken your father’s animals and given them to me.",
      "10": "“One time during the mating season, I had a dream and saw that the male goats mating with the females were streaked, speckled, and spotted.",
      "11": "Then in my dream, the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I replied, ‘Yes, here I am.’",
      "12": "“The angel said, ‘Look up, and you will see that only the streaked, speckled, and spotted males are mating with the females of your flock. For I have seen how Laban has treated you.",

      "14": "Rachel and Leah responded, “That’s fine with us! We won’t inherit any of our father’s wealth anyway.",
      "15": "He has reduced our rights to those of foreign women. And after he sold us, he wasted the money you paid him for us.",
      "16": "All the wealth God has given you from our father legally belongs to us and our children. So go ahead and do whatever God has told you.”",
      "17": "So Jacob put his wives and children on camels,",

      "19": "At the time they left, Laban was some distance away, shearing his sheep. Rachel stole her father’s household idols and took them with her.",
      "20": "Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, for they set out secretly and never told Laban they were leaving.",
      "21": "So Jacob took all his possessions with him and crossed the Euphrates River, heading for the hill country of Gilead.",
      "22": "Three days later, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.",
      "23": "So he gathered a group of his relatives and set out in hot pursuit. He caught up with Jacob seven days later in the hill country of Gilead.",

      "26": "“What do you mean by deceiving me like this?” Laban demanded. “How dare you drag my daughters away like prisoners of war?",
      "27": "Why did you slip away secretly? Why did you deceive me? And why didn’t you say you wanted to leave? I would have given you a farewell feast, with singing and music, accompanied by tambourines and harps.",
      "28": "Why didn’t you let me kiss my daughters and grandchildren and tell them good-bye? You have acted very foolishly!",
      "29": "I could destroy you, but the God of your father appeared to me last night and warned me, ‘Leave Jacob alone!’",
      "30": "I can understand your feeling that you must go, and your intense longing for your father’s home. But why have you stolen my gods?”",
      "31": "“I rushed away because I was afraid,” Jacob answered. “I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.",
      "32": "But as for your gods, see if you can find them, and let the person who has taken them die! And if you find anything else that belongs to you, identify it before all these relatives of ours, and I will give it back!” But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the household idols.",
      "33": "Laban went first into Jacob’s tent to search there, then into Leah’s, and then the tents of the two servant wives—but he found nothing. Finally, he went into Rachel’s tent.",
      "34": "But Rachel had taken the household idols and hidden them in her camel saddle, and now she was sitting on them. When Laban had thoroughly searched her tent without finding them,",
      "35": "she said to her father, “Please, sir, forgive me if I don’t get up for you. I’m having my monthly period.” So Laban continued his search, but he could not find the household idols.",
      "36": "Then Jacob became very angry, and he challenged Laban. “What’s my crime?” he demanded. “What have I done wrong to make you chase after me as though I were a criminal?",
      "37": "You have rummaged through everything I own. Now show me what you found that belongs to you! Set it out here in front of us, before our relatives, for all to see. Let them judge between us!",
      "38": "“For twenty years I have been with you, caring for your flocks. In all that time your sheep and goats never miscarried. In all those years I never used a single ram of yours for food.",
      "39": "If any were attacked and killed by wild animals, I never showed you the carcass and asked you to reduce the count of your flock. No, I took the loss myself! You made me pay for every stolen animal, whether it was taken in broad daylight or in the dark of night.",
      "40": "“I worked for you through the scorching heat of the day and through cold and sleepless nights.",
      "41": "Yes, for twenty years I slaved in your house! I worked for fourteen years earning your two daughters, and then six more years for your flock. And you changed my wages ten times!",
      "42": "In fact, if the God of my father had not been on my side—the God of Abraham and the fearsome God of Isaac—you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen your abuse and my hard work. That is why he appeared to you last night and rebuked you!”",
      "43": "Then Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks—in fact, everything you see is mine. But what can I do now about my daughters and their children?",
      "44": "So come, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and it will be a witness to our commitment.”",
      "45": "So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument.",

      "47": "To commemorate the event, Laban called the place Jegar-sahadutha (which means “witness pile” in Aramaic), and Jacob called it Galeed (which means “witness pile” in Hebrew).",
      "48": "Then Laban declared, “This pile of stones will stand as a witness to remind us of the covenant we have made today.” This explains why it was called Galeed—“Witness Pile.”",
      "49": "But it was also called Mizpah (which means “watchtower”), for Laban said, “May the LORD keep watch between us to make sure that we keep this covenant when we are out of each other’s sight.",
      "50": "If you mistreat my daughters or if you marry other wives, God will see it even if no one else does. He is a witness to this covenant between us.",
      "51": "“See this pile of stones,” Laban continued, “and see this monument I have set between us.",
      "52": "They stand between us as witnesses of our vows. I will never pass this pile of stones to harm you, and you must never pass these stones or this monument to harm me.",
      "53": "I call on the God of our ancestors—the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of my grandfather Nahor—to serve as a judge between us.” So Jacob took an oath before the fearsome God of his father, Isaac, to respect the boundary line.",
      "54": "Then Jacob offered a sacrifice to God there on the mountain and invited everyone to a covenant feast. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain.",

      "10": "I am not worthy of all the unfailing love and faithfulness you have shown to me, your servant. When I left home and crossed the Jordan River, I owned nothing except a walking stick. Now my household fills two large camps!",
      "11": "O LORD, please rescue me from the hand of my brother, Esau. I am afraid that he is coming to attack me, along with my wives and children.",
      "12": "But you promised me, ‘I will surely treat you kindly, and I will multiply your descendants until they become as numerous as the sands along the seashore—too many to count.’”",

      "17": "He gave these instructions to the men leading the first group: “When my brother, Esau, meets you, he will ask, ‘Whose servants are you? Where are you going? Who owns these animals?’",
      "18": "You must reply, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob, but they are a gift for his master Esau. Look, he is coming right behind us.’”",

      "4": "They remained in prison for quite some time, and the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, who looked after them.",
      "5": "While they were in prison, Pharaoh’s cup-bearer and baker each had a dream one night, and each dream had its own meaning.",

      "10": "The vine had three branches that began to bud and blossom, and soon it produced clusters of ripe grapes.",
      "11": "I was holding Pharaoh’s wine cup in my hand, so I took a cluster of grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup. Then I placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”",

      "27": "The seven thin, scrawny cows that came up later and the seven thin heads of grain, withered by the east wind, represent seven years of famine.",

      "33": "“Therefore, Pharaoh should find an intelligent and wise man and put him in charge of the entire land of Egypt.",
      "34": "Then Pharaoh should appoint supervisors over the land and let them collect one-fifth of all the crops during the seven good years.",
      "35": "Have them gather all the food produced in the good years that are just ahead and bring it to Pharaoh’s storehouses. Store it away, and guard it so there will be food in the cities.",

      "45": "Then Pharaoh gave Joseph a new Egyptian name, Zaphenath-paneah. He also gave him a wife, whose name was Asenath. She was the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On. So Joseph took charge of the entire land of Egypt.",
      "46": "He was thirty years old when he began serving in the court of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And when Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence, he inspected the entire land of Egypt.",
      "47": "As predicted, for seven years the land produced bumper crops.",
      "48": "During those years, Joseph gathered all the crops grown in Egypt and stored the grain from the surrounding fields in the cities.",
      "49": "He piled up huge amounts of grain like sand on the seashore. Finally, he stopped keeping records because there was too much to measure.",
      "50": "During this time, before the first of the famine years, two sons were born to Joseph and his wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On.",
      "51": "Joseph named his older son Manasseh, for he said, “God has made me forget all my troubles and everyone in my father’s family.”",
      "52": "Joseph named his second son Ephraim, for he said, “God has made me fruitful in this land of my grief.”",
      "53": "At last the seven years of bumper crops throughout the land of Egypt came to an end.",
      "54": "Then the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had predicted. The famine also struck all the surrounding countries, but throughout Egypt there was plenty of food.",
      "55": "Eventually, however, the famine spread throughout the land of Egypt as well. And when the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told them, “Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you.”",
      "56": "So with severe famine everywhere, Joseph opened up the storehouses and distributed grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout the land of Egypt.",

      "2": "I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy enough grain to keep us alive. Otherwise we’ll die.”",
      "3": "So Joseph’s ten older brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain.",
      "4": "But Jacob wouldn’t let Joseph’s younger brother, Benjamin, go with them, for fear some harm might come to him.",
      "5": "So Jacob’s sons arrived in Egypt along with others to buy food, for the famine was in Canaan as well.",
      "6": "Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt and in charge of selling grain to all the people, it was to him that his brothers came. When they arrived, they bowed before him with their faces to the ground.",
      "7": "Joseph recognized his brothers instantly, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where are you from?” he demanded. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied. “We have come to buy food.”",
      "8": "Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they didn’t recognize him.",
      "9": "And he remembered the dreams he’d had about them many years before. He said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.”",

      "11": "We are all brothers—members of the same family. We are honest men, sir! We are not spies!”",
      "12": "“Yes, you are!” Joseph insisted. “You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.”",
      "13": "“Sir,” they said, “there are actually twelve of us. We, your servants, are all brothers, sons of a man living in the land of Canaan. Our youngest brother is back there with our father right now, and one of our brothers is no longer with us.”",
      "14": "But Joseph insisted, “As I said, you are spies!",
      "15": "This is how I will test your story. I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you will never leave Egypt unless your youngest brother comes here!",
      "16": "One of you must go and get your brother. I’ll keep the rest of you here in prison. Then we’ll find out whether or not your story is true. By the life of Pharaoh, if it turns out that you don’t have a younger brother, then I’ll know you are spies.”",
      "17": "So Joseph put them all in prison for three days.",
      "18": "On the third day Joseph said to them, “I am a God-fearing man. If you do as I say, you will live.",
      "19": "If you really are honest men, choose one of your brothers to remain in prison. The rest of you may go home with grain for your starving families.",
      "20": "But you must bring your youngest brother back to me. This will prove that you are telling the truth, and you will not die.” To this they agreed.",
      "21": "Speaking among themselves, they said, “Clearly we are being punished because of what we did to Joseph long ago. We saw his anguish when he pleaded for his life, but we wouldn’t listen. That’s why we’re in this trouble.”",
      "22": "“Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy?” Reuben asked. “But you wouldn’t listen. And now we have to answer for his blood!”",
      "23": "Of course, they didn’t know that Joseph understood them, for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter.",
      "24": "Now he turned away from them and began to weep. When he regained his composure, he spoke to them again. Then he chose Simeon from among them and had him tied up right before their eyes.",

      "27": "But when they stopped for the night and one of them opened his sack to get grain for his donkey, he found his money in the top of his sack.",
      "28": "“Look!” he exclaimed to his brothers. “My money has been returned; it’s here in my sack!” Then their hearts sank. Trembling, they said to each other, “What has God done to us?”",
      "29": "When the brothers came to their father, Jacob, in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them.",
      "30": "“The man who is governor of the land spoke very harshly to us,” they told him. “He accused us of being spies scouting the land.",

      "32": "We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One brother is no longer with us, and the youngest is at home with our father in the land of Canaan.’",
      "33": "“Then the man who is governor of the land told us, ‘This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take grain for your starving families and go on home.",
