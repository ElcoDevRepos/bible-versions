      "18": "Then the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him.”",
      "19": "So the LORD God formed from the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one.",

      "23": "“At last!” the man exclaimed. “This one is bone from my bone, and flesh from my flesh! She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken from ‘man.’”",

      "7": "At that moment their eyes were opened, and they suddenly felt shame at their nakedness. So they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.",

      "19": "When she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels, too, until they have had enough to drink.”",

      "32": "So the man went home with Laban, and Laban unloaded the camels, gave him straw for their bedding, fed them, and provided water for the man and the camel drivers to wash their feet.",

      "39": "“But I said to my master, ‘What if I can’t find a young woman who is willing to go back with me?’",

      "47": "“Then I asked, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel, and my grandparents are Nahor and Milcah.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.",
      "48": "“Then I bowed low and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master, Abraham, because he had led me straight to my master’s niece to be his son’s wife.",
      "49": "So tell me—will you or won’t you show unfailing love and faithfulness to my master? Please tell me yes or no, and then I’ll know what to do next.”",
      "50": "Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “The LORD has obviously brought you here, so there is nothing we can say.",
      "51": "Here is Rebekah; take her and go. Yes, let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has directed.”",
      "52": "When Abraham’s servant heard their answer, he bowed down to the ground and worshiped the LORD.",
      "53": "Then he brought out silver and gold jewelry and clothing and presented them to Rebekah. He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother.",

      "56": "But he said, “Don’t delay me. The LORD has made my mission successful; now send me back so I can return to my master.”",
      "57": "“Well,” they said, “we’ll call Rebekah and ask her what she thinks.”",
      "58": "So they called Rebekah. “Are you willing to go with this man?” they asked her. And she replied, “Yes, I will go.”",
      "59": "So they said good-bye to Rebekah and sent her away with Abraham’s servant and his men. The woman who had been Rebekah’s childhood nurse went along with her.",
      "60": "They gave her this blessing as she parted: “Our sister, may you become the mother of many millions! May your descendants be strong and conquer the cities of their enemies.”",
      "61": "Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the man. So Abraham’s servant took Rebekah and went on his way.",

      "18": "The next morning Jacob got up very early. He took the stone he had rested his head against, and he set it upright as a memorial pillar. Then he poured olive oil over it.",
      "19": "He named that place Bethel (which means “house of God”), although it was previously called Luz.",
      "20": "Then Jacob made this vow: “If God will indeed be with me and protect me on this journey, and if he will provide me with food and clothing,",
      "21": "and if I return safely to my father’s home, then the LORD will certainly be my God.",
      "22": "And this memorial pillar I have set up will become a place for worshiping God, and I will present to God a tenth of everything he gives me.”"

      "1": "Then Jacob hurried on, finally arriving in the land of the east.",
      "2": "He saw a well in the distance. Three flocks of sheep and goats lay in an open field beside it, waiting to be watered. But a heavy stone covered the mouth of the well.",
      "3": "It was the custom there to wait for all the flocks to arrive before removing the stone and watering the animals. Afterward the stone would be placed back over the mouth of the well.",
      "4": "Jacob went over to the shepherds and asked, “Where are you from, my friends?” “We are from Haran,” they answered.",
      "5": "“Do you know a man there named Laban, the grandson of Nahor?” he asked. “Yes, we do,” they replied.",
      "6": "“Is he doing well?” Jacob asked. “Yes, he’s well,” they answered. “Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the flock now.”",
      "7": "Jacob said, “Look, it’s still broad daylight—too early to round up the animals. Why don’t you water the sheep and goats so they can get back out to pasture?”",
      "8": "“We can’t water the animals until all the flocks have arrived,” they replied. “Then the shepherds move the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water all the sheep and goats.”",
      "9": "Jacob was still talking with them when Rachel arrived with her father’s flock, for she was a shepherd.",
      "10": "And because Rachel was his cousin—the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother—and because the sheep and goats belonged to his uncle Laban, Jacob went over to the well and moved the stone from its mouth and watered his uncle’s flock.",
      "11": "Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and he wept aloud.",
      "12": "He explained to Rachel that he was her cousin on her father’s side—the son of her aunt Rebekah. So Rachel quickly ran and told her father, Laban.",
      "13": "As soon as Laban heard that his nephew Jacob had arrived, he ran out to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him home. When Jacob had told him his story,",
      "14": "Laban exclaimed, “You really are my own flesh and blood!” After Jacob had stayed with Laban for about a month,",
      "15": "Laban said to him, “You shouldn’t work for me without pay just because we are relatives. Tell me how much your wages should be.”",
      "16": "Now Laban had two daughters. The older daughter was named Leah, and the younger one was Rachel.",
      "17": "There was no sparkle in Leah’s eyes, but Rachel had a beautiful figure and a lovely face.",
      "18": "Since Jacob was in love with Rachel, he told her father, “I’ll work for you for seven years if you’ll give me Rachel, your younger daughter, as my wife.”",
      "19": "“Agreed!” Laban replied. “I’d rather give her to you than to anyone else. Stay and work with me.”",
      "20": "So Jacob worked seven years to pay for Rachel. But his love for her was so strong that it seemed to him but a few days.",
      "21": "Finally, the time came for him to marry her. “I have fulfilled my agreement,” Jacob said to Laban. “Now give me my wife so I can sleep with her.”",
      "22": "So Laban invited everyone in the neighborhood and prepared a wedding feast.",
      "23": "But that night, when it was dark, Laban took Leah to Jacob, and he slept with her.",
      "24": "(Laban had given Leah a servant, Zilpah, to be her maid.)",
      "25": "But when Jacob woke up in the morning—it was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob raged at Laban. “I worked seven years for Rachel! Why have you tricked me?”",
      "26": "“It’s not our custom here to marry off a younger daughter ahead of the firstborn,” Laban replied.",
      "27": "“But wait until the bridal week is over; then we’ll give you Rachel, too—provided you promise to work another seven years for me.”",
      "28": "So Jacob agreed to work seven more years. A week after Jacob had married Leah, Laban gave him Rachel, too.",
      "29": "(Laban gave Rachel a servant, Bilhah, to be her maid.)",
      "30": "So Jacob slept with Rachel, too, and he loved her much more than Leah. He then stayed and worked for Laban the additional seven years.",
      "31": "When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to have children, but Rachel could not conceive.",
      "32": "So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “The LORD has noticed my misery, and now my husband will love me.”",
      "33": "She soon became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She named him Simeon, for she said, “The LORD heard that I was unloved and has given me another son.”",
      "34": "Then she became pregnant a third time and gave birth to another son. He was named Levi, for she said, “Surely this time my husband will feel affection for me, since I have given him three sons!”",
      "35": "Once again Leah became pregnant and gave birth to another son. She named him Judah, for she said, “Now I will praise the LORD!” And then she stopped having children."

      "3": "Then Rachel told him, “Take my maid, Bilhah, and sleep with her. She will bear children for me, and through her I can have a family, too.”",
      "4": "So Rachel gave her servant, Bilhah, to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her.",

      "9": "Meanwhile, Leah realized that she wasn’t getting pregnant anymore, so she took her servant, Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.",
      "10": "Soon Zilpah presented him with a son.",
      "11": "Leah named him Gad, for she said, “How fortunate I am!”",

      "13": "And Leah named him Asher, for she said, “What joy is mine! Now the other women will celebrate with me.”",
      "14": "One day during the wheat harvest, Reuben found some mandrakes growing in a field and brought them to his mother, Leah. Rachel begged Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”",
      "15": "But Leah angrily replied, “Wasn’t it enough that you stole my husband? Now will you steal my son’s mandrakes, too?” Rachel answered, “I will let Jacob sleep with you tonight if you give me some of the mandrakes.”",
      "16": "So that evening, as Jacob was coming home from the fields, Leah went out to meet him. “You must come and sleep with me tonight!” she said. “I have paid for you with some mandrakes that my son found.” So that night he slept with Leah.",
      "17": "And God answered Leah’s prayers. She became pregnant again and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob.",
      "18": "She named him Issachar, for she said, “God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband as a wife.”",
      "19": "Then Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob.",
      "20": "She named him Zebulun, for she said, “God has given me a good reward. Now my husband will treat me with respect, for I have given him six sons.”",
      "21": "Later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.",
      "22": "Then God remembered Rachel’s plight and answered her prayers by enabling her to have children.",

      "24": "And she named him Joseph, for she said, “May the LORD add yet another son to my family.”",

      "27": "“Please listen to me,” Laban replied. “I have become wealthy, for the LORD has blessed me because of you.",
      "28": "Tell me how much I owe you. Whatever it is, I’ll pay it.”",
      "29": "Jacob replied, “You know how hard I’ve worked for you, and how your flocks and herds have grown under my care.",
      "30": "You had little indeed before I came, but your wealth has increased enormously. The LORD has blessed you through everything I’ve done. But now, what about me? When can I start providing for my own family?”",
      "31": "“What wages do you want?” Laban asked again. Jacob replied, “Don’t give me anything. Just do this one thing, and I’ll continue to tend and watch over your flocks.",
      "32": "Let me inspect your flocks today and remove all the sheep and goats that are speckled or spotted, along with all the black sheep. Give these to me as my wages.",
      "33": "In the future, when you check on the animals you have given me as my wages, you’ll see that I have been honest. If you find in my flock any goats without speckles or spots, or any sheep that are not black, you will know that I have stolen them from you.”",
      "34": "“All right,” Laban replied. “It will be as you say.”",
      "35": "But that very day Laban went out and removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted or had white patches, and all the black sheep. He placed them in the care of his own sons,",
      "36": "who took them a three-days’ journey from where Jacob was. Meanwhile, Jacob stayed and cared for the rest of Laban’s flock.",
      "37": "Then Jacob took some fresh branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled off strips of bark, making white streaks on them.",
      "38": "Then he placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, for that was where they mated.",
      "39": "And when they mated in front of the white-streaked branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.",
      "40": "Jacob separated those lambs from Laban’s flock. And at mating time he turned the flock to face Laban’s animals that were streaked or black. This is how he built his own flock instead of increasing Laban’s.",
      "41": "Whenever the stronger females were ready to mate, Jacob would place the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of them. Then they would mate in front of the branches.",
      "42": "But he didn’t do this with the weaker ones, so the weaker lambs belonged to Laban, and the stronger ones were Jacob’s.",
      "43": "As a result, Jacob became very wealthy, with large flocks of sheep and goats, female and male servants, and many camels and donkeys."

      "3": "Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your father and grandfather and to your relatives there, and I will be with you.”",
      "4": "So Jacob called Rachel and Leah out to the field where he was watching his flock.",
      "5": "He said to them, “I have noticed that your father’s attitude toward me has changed. But the God of my father has been with me.",

      "7": "but he has cheated me, changing my wages ten times. But God has not allowed him to do me any harm.",
      "8": "For if he said, ‘The speckled animals will be your wages,’ the whole flock began to produce speckled young. And when he changed his mind and said, ‘The striped animals will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced striped young.",
      "9": "In this way, God has taken your father’s animals and given them to me.",
      "10": "“One time during the mating season, I had a dream and saw that the male goats mating with the females were streaked, speckled, and spotted.",
      "11": "Then in my dream, the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I replied, ‘Yes, here I am.’",
      "12": "“The angel said, ‘Look up, and you will see that only the streaked, speckled, and spotted males are mating with the females of your flock. For I have seen how Laban has treated you.",

      "14": "Rachel and Leah responded, “That’s fine with us! We won’t inherit any of our father’s wealth anyway.",
      "15": "He has reduced our rights to those of foreign women. And after he sold us, he wasted the money you paid him for us.",
      "16": "All the wealth God has given you from our father legally belongs to us and our children. So go ahead and do whatever God has told you.”",
      "17": "So Jacob put his wives and children on camels,",

      "19": "At the time they left, Laban was some distance away, shearing his sheep. Rachel stole her father’s household idols and took them with her.",
      "20": "Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, for they set out secretly and never told Laban they were leaving.",
      "21": "So Jacob took all his possessions with him and crossed the Euphrates River, heading for the hill country of Gilead.",
      "22": "Three days later, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.",
      "23": "So he gathered a group of his relatives and set out in hot pursuit. He caught up with Jacob seven days later in the hill country of Gilead.",

      "26": "“What do you mean by deceiving me like this?” Laban demanded. “How dare you drag my daughters away like prisoners of war?",
      "27": "Why did you slip away secretly? Why did you deceive me? And why didn’t you say you wanted to leave? I would have given you a farewell feast, with singing and music, accompanied by tambourines and harps.",
      "28": "Why didn’t you let me kiss my daughters and grandchildren and tell them good-bye? You have acted very foolishly!",
      "29": "I could destroy you, but the God of your father appeared to me last night and warned me, ‘Leave Jacob alone!’",
      "30": "I can understand your feeling that you must go, and your intense longing for your father’s home. But why have you stolen my gods?”",
      "31": "“I rushed away because I was afraid,” Jacob answered. “I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.",
      "32": "But as for your gods, see if you can find them, and let the person who has taken them die! And if you find anything else that belongs to you, identify it before all these relatives of ours, and I will give it back!” But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the household idols.",
      "33": "Laban went first into Jacob’s tent to search there, then into Leah’s, and then the tents of the two servant wives—but he found nothing. Finally, he went into Rachel’s tent.",
      "34": "But Rachel had taken the household idols and hidden them in her camel saddle, and now she was sitting on them. When Laban had thoroughly searched her tent without finding them,",
      "35": "she said to her father, “Please, sir, forgive me if I don’t get up for you. I’m having my monthly period.” So Laban continued his search, but he could not find the household idols.",
      "36": "Then Jacob became very angry, and he challenged Laban. “What’s my crime?” he demanded. “What have I done wrong to make you chase after me as though I were a criminal?",
      "37": "You have rummaged through everything I own. Now show me what you found that belongs to you! Set it out here in front of us, before our relatives, for all to see. Let them judge between us!",
      "38": "“For twenty years I have been with you, caring for your flocks. In all that time your sheep and goats never miscarried. In all those years I never used a single ram of yours for food.",
      "39": "If any were attacked and killed by wild animals, I never showed you the carcass and asked you to reduce the count of your flock. No, I took the loss myself! You made me pay for every stolen animal, whether it was taken in broad daylight or in the dark of night.",
      "40": "“I worked for you through the scorching heat of the day and through cold and sleepless nights.",
      "41": "Yes, for twenty years I slaved in your house! I worked for fourteen years earning your two daughters, and then six more years for your flock. And you changed my wages ten times!",
      "42": "In fact, if the God of my father had not been on my side—the God of Abraham and the fearsome God of Isaac—you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen your abuse and my hard work. That is why he appeared to you last night and rebuked you!”",
      "43": "Then Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks—in fact, everything you see is mine. But what can I do now about my daughters and their children?",
      "44": "So come, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and it will be a witness to our commitment.”",
      "45": "So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument.",

      "47": "To commemorate the event, Laban called the place Jegar-sahadutha (which means “witness pile” in Aramaic), and Jacob called it Galeed (which means “witness pile” in Hebrew).",
      "48": "Then Laban declared, “This pile of stones will stand as a witness to remind us of the covenant we have made today.” This explains why it was called Galeed—“Witness Pile.”",
      "49": "But it was also called Mizpah (which means “watchtower”), for Laban said, “May the LORD keep watch between us to make sure that we keep this covenant when we are out of each other’s sight.",
      "50": "If you mistreat my daughters or if you marry other wives, God will see it even if no one else does. He is a witness to this covenant between us.",
      "51": "“See this pile of stones,” Laban continued, “and see this monument I have set between us.",
      "52": "They stand between us as witnesses of our vows. I will never pass this pile of stones to harm you, and you must never pass these stones or this monument to harm me.",
      "53": "I call on the God of our ancestors—the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of my grandfather Nahor—to serve as a judge between us.” So Jacob took an oath before the fearsome God of his father, Isaac, to respect the boundary line.",
      "54": "Then Jacob offered a sacrifice to God there on the mountain and invited everyone to a covenant feast. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain.",

      "10": "I am not worthy of all the unfailing love and faithfulness you have shown to me, your servant. When I left home and crossed the Jordan River, I owned nothing except a walking stick. Now my household fills two large camps!",
      "11": "O LORD, please rescue me from the hand of my brother, Esau. I am afraid that he is coming to attack me, along with my wives and children.",
      "12": "But you promised me, ‘I will surely treat you kindly, and I will multiply your descendants until they become as numerous as the sands along the seashore—too many to count.’”",

      "17": "He gave these instructions to the men leading the first group: “When my brother, Esau, meets you, he will ask, ‘Whose servants are you? Where are you going? Who owns these animals?’",
      "18": "You must reply, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob, but they are a gift for his master Esau. Look, he is coming right behind us.’”",

      "4": "They remained in prison for quite some time, and the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, who looked after them.",
      "5": "While they were in prison, Pharaoh’s cup-bearer and baker each had a dream one night, and each dream had its own meaning.",

      "10": "The vine had three branches that began to bud and blossom, and soon it produced clusters of ripe grapes.",
      "11": "I was holding Pharaoh’s wine cup in my hand, so I took a cluster of grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup. Then I placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”",

      "27": "The seven thin, scrawny cows that came up later and the seven thin heads of grain, withered by the east wind, represent seven years of famine.",

      "33": "“Therefore, Pharaoh should find an intelligent and wise man and put him in charge of the entire land of Egypt.",
      "34": "Then Pharaoh should appoint supervisors over the land and let them collect one-fifth of all the crops during the seven good years.",
      "35": "Have them gather all the food produced in the good years that are just ahead and bring it to Pharaoh’s storehouses. Store it away, and guard it so there will be food in the cities.",

      "45": "Then Pharaoh gave Joseph a new Egyptian name, Zaphenath-paneah. He also gave him a wife, whose name was Asenath. She was the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On. So Joseph took charge of the entire land of Egypt.",
      "46": "He was thirty years old when he began serving in the court of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And when Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence, he inspected the entire land of Egypt.",
      "47": "As predicted, for seven years the land produced bumper crops.",
      "48": "During those years, Joseph gathered all the crops grown in Egypt and stored the grain from the surrounding fields in the cities.",
      "49": "He piled up huge amounts of grain like sand on the seashore. Finally, he stopped keeping records because there was too much to measure.",
      "50": "During this time, before the first of the famine years, two sons were born to Joseph and his wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On.",
      "51": "Joseph named his older son Manasseh, for he said, “God has made me forget all my troubles and everyone in my father’s family.”",
      "52": "Joseph named his second son Ephraim, for he said, “God has made me fruitful in this land of my grief.”",
      "53": "At last the seven years of bumper crops throughout the land of Egypt came to an end.",
      "54": "Then the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had predicted. The famine also struck all the surrounding countries, but throughout Egypt there was plenty of food.",
      "55": "Eventually, however, the famine spread throughout the land of Egypt as well. And when the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told them, “Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you.”",
      "56": "So with severe famine everywhere, Joseph opened up the storehouses and distributed grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout the land of Egypt.",

      "2": "I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy enough grain to keep us alive. Otherwise we’ll die.”",
      "3": "So Joseph’s ten older brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain.",
      "4": "But Jacob wouldn’t let Joseph’s younger brother, Benjamin, go with them, for fear some harm might come to him.",
      "5": "So Jacob’s sons arrived in Egypt along with others to buy food, for the famine was in Canaan as well.",
      "6": "Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt and in charge of selling grain to all the people, it was to him that his brothers came. When they arrived, they bowed before him with their faces to the ground.",
      "7": "Joseph recognized his brothers instantly, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where are you from?” he demanded. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied. “We have come to buy food.”",
      "8": "Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they didn’t recognize him.",
      "9": "And he remembered the dreams he’d had about them many years before. He said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.”",

      "11": "We are all brothers—members of the same family. We are honest men, sir! We are not spies!”",
      "12": "“Yes, you are!” Joseph insisted. “You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.”",
      "13": "“Sir,” they said, “there are actually twelve of us. We, your servants, are all brothers, sons of a man living in the land of Canaan. Our youngest brother is back there with our father right now, and one of our brothers is no longer with us.”",
      "14": "But Joseph insisted, “As I said, you are spies!",
      "15": "This is how I will test your story. I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you will never leave Egypt unless your youngest brother comes here!",
      "16": "One of you must go and get your brother. I’ll keep the rest of you here in prison. Then we’ll find out whether or not your story is true. By the life of Pharaoh, if it turns out that you don’t have a younger brother, then I’ll know you are spies.”",
      "17": "So Joseph put them all in prison for three days.",
      "18": "On the third day Joseph said to them, “I am a God-fearing man. If you do as I say, you will live.",
      "19": "If you really are honest men, choose one of your brothers to remain in prison. The rest of you may go home with grain for your starving families.",
      "20": "But you must bring your youngest brother back to me. This will prove that you are telling the truth, and you will not die.” To this they agreed.",
      "21": "Speaking among themselves, they said, “Clearly we are being punished because of what we did to Joseph long ago. We saw his anguish when he pleaded for his life, but we wouldn’t listen. That’s why we’re in this trouble.”",
      "22": "“Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy?” Reuben asked. “But you wouldn’t listen. And now we have to answer for his blood!”",
      "23": "Of course, they didn’t know that Joseph understood them, for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter.",
      "24": "Now he turned away from them and began to weep. When he regained his composure, he spoke to them again. Then he chose Simeon from among them and had him tied up right before their eyes.",

      "27": "But when they stopped for the night and one of them opened his sack to get grain for his donkey, he found his money in the top of his sack.",
      "28": "“Look!” he exclaimed to his brothers. “My money has been returned; it’s here in my sack!” Then their hearts sank. Trembling, they said to each other, “What has God done to us?”",
      "29": "When the brothers came to their father, Jacob, in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them.",
      "30": "“The man who is governor of the land spoke very harshly to us,” they told him. “He accused us of being spies scouting the land.",

      "32": "We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One brother is no longer with us, and the youngest is at home with our father in the land of Canaan.’",
      "33": "“Then the man who is governor of the land told us, ‘This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take grain for your starving families and go on home.",

      "3": "While at Micah’s house, they recognized the young Levite’s accent, so they went over and asked him, “Who brought you here, and what are you doing in this place? Why are you here?”",

      "19": "“Be quiet and come with us,” they said. “Be a father and priest to all of us. Isn’t it better to be a priest for an entire tribe and clan of Israel than for the household of just one man?”",

      "24": "“What do you mean, ‘What’s the matter?’” Micah replied. “You’ve taken away all the gods I have made, and my priest, and I have nothing left!”",
      "25": "The men of Dan said, “Watch what you say! There are some short-tempered men around here who might get angry and kill you and your family.”",
      "26": "So the men of Dan continued on their way. When Micah saw that there were too many of them for him to attack, he turned around and went home.",
      "27": "Then, with Micah’s idols and his priest, the men of Dan came to the town of Laish, whose people were peaceful and secure. They attacked with swords and burned the town to the ground.",
      "28": "There was no one to rescue the people, for they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby. This happened in the valley near Beth-rehob. Then the people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the town and lived there.",
      "29": "They renamed the town Dan after their ancestor, Israel’s son, but it had originally been called Laish.",
      "30": "Then they set up the carved image, and they appointed Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses, as their priest. This family continued as priests for the tribe of Dan until the Exile.",

      "15": "When Ruth went back to work again, Boaz ordered his young men, “Let her gather grain right among the sheaves without stopping her.",
      "16": "And pull out some heads of barley from the bundles and drop them on purpose for her. Let her pick them up, and don’t give her a hard time!”",
      "17": "So Ruth gathered barley there all day, and when she beat out the grain that evening, it filled an entire basket.",

      "19": "“Where did you gather all this grain today?” Naomi asked. “Where did you work? May the LORD bless the one who helped you!” So Ruth told her mother-in-law about the man in whose field she had worked. She said, “The man I worked with today is named Boaz.”",
      "20": "“May the LORD bless him!” Naomi told her daughter-in-law. “He is showing his kindness to us as well as to your dead husband. That man is one of our closest relatives, one of our family redeemers.”",
      "21": "Then Ruth said, “What’s more, Boaz even told me to come back and stay with his harvesters until the entire harvest is completed.”",
      "22": "“Good!” Naomi exclaimed. “Do as he said, my daughter. Stay with his young women right through the whole harvest. You might be harassed in other fields, but you’ll be safe with him.”",
      "23": "So Ruth worked alongside the women in Boaz’s fields and gathered grain with them until the end of the barley harvest. Then she continued working with them through the wheat harvest in early summer. And all the while she lived with her mother-in-law."

      "3": "Now do as I tell you—take a bath and put on perfume and dress in your nicest clothes. Then go to the threshing floor, but don’t let Boaz see you until he has finished eating and drinking.",
      "4": "Be sure to notice where he lies down; then go and uncover his feet and lie down there. He will tell you what to do.”",
      "5": "“I will do everything you say,” Ruth replied.",
      "6": "So she went down to the threshing floor that night and followed the instructions of her mother-in-law.",
      "7": "After Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he lay down at the far end of the pile of grain and went to sleep. Then Ruth came quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.",

      "10": "“The LORD bless you, my daughter!” Boaz exclaimed. “You are showing even more family loyalty now than you did before, for you have not gone after a younger man, whether rich or poor.",
      "11": "Now don’t worry about a thing, my daughter. I will do what is necessary, for everyone in town knows you are a virtuous woman.",
      "12": "But while it’s true that I am one of your family redeemers, there is another man who is more closely related to you than I am.",
      "13": "Stay here tonight, and in the morning I will talk to him. If he is willing to redeem you, very well. Let him marry you. But if he is not willing, then as surely as the LORD lives, I will redeem you myself! Now lie down here until morning.”",
      "14": "So Ruth lay at Boaz’s feet until the morning, but she got up before it was light enough for people to recognize each other. For Boaz had said, “No one must know that a woman was here at the threshing floor.”",
      "15": "Then Boaz said to her, “Bring your cloak and spread it out.” He measured six scoops of barley into the cloak and placed it on her back. Then he returned to the town.",

      "4": "I thought I should speak to you about it so that you can redeem it if you wish. If you want the land, then buy it here in the presence of these witnesses. But if you don’t want it, let me know right away, because I am next in line to redeem it after you.” The man replied, “All right, I’ll redeem it.”",
      "5": "Then Boaz told him, “Of course, your purchase of the land from Naomi also requires that you marry Ruth, the Moabite widow. That way she can have children who will carry on her husband’s name and keep the land in the family.”",
      "6": "“Then I can’t redeem it,” the family redeemer replied, “because this might endanger my own estate. You redeem the land; I cannot do it.”",

      "9": "Then Boaz said to the elders and to the crowd standing around, “You are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.",
      "10": "And with the land I have acquired Ruth, the Moabite widow of Mahlon, to be my wife. This way she can have a son to carry on the family name of her dead husband and to inherit the family property here in his hometown. You are all witnesses today.”",
      "11": "Then the elders and all the people standing in the gate replied, “We are witnesses! May the LORD make this woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, from whom all the nation of Israel descended! May you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.",

      "14": "Then the women of the town said to Naomi, “Praise the LORD, who has now provided a redeemer for your family! May this child be famous in Israel.",
      "15": "May he restore your youth and care for you in your old age. For he is the son of your daughter-in-law who loves you and has been better to you than seven sons!”",

      "6": "Don’t be stubborn and rebellious as Pharaoh and the Egyptians were. By the time God was finished with them, they were eager to let Israel go.",
      "7": "“Now build a new cart, and find two cows that have just given birth to calves. Make sure the cows have never been yoked to a cart. Hitch the cows to the cart, but shut their calves away from them in a pen.",
      "8": "Put the Ark of the LORD on the cart, and beside it place a chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors you are sending as a guilt offering. Then let the cows go wherever they want.",
      "9": "If they cross the border of our land and go to Beth-shemesh, we will know it was the LORD who brought this great disaster upon us. If they don’t, we will know it was not his hand that caused the plague. It came simply by chance.”",
      "10": "So these instructions were carried out. Two cows were hitched to the cart, and their newborn calves were shut up in a pen.",
      "11": "Then the Ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors were placed on the cart.",
      "12": "And sure enough, without veering off in other directions, the cows went straight along the road toward Beth-shemesh, lowing as they went. The Philistine rulers followed them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.",
      "13": "The people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they saw the Ark, they were overjoyed!",
      "14": "The cart came into the field of a man named Joshua and stopped beside a large rock. So the people broke up the wood of the cart for a fire and killed the cows and sacrificed them to the LORD as a burnt offering.",
      "15": "Several men of the tribe of Levi lifted the Ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors from the cart and placed them on the large rock. Many sacrifices and burnt offerings were offered to the LORD that day by the people of Beth-shemesh.",
      "16": "The five Philistine rulers watched all this and then returned to Ekron that same day.",
      "17": "The five gold tumors sent by the Philistines as a guilt offering to the LORD were gifts from the rulers of Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.",
      "18": "The five gold rats represented the five Philistine towns and their surrounding villages, which were controlled by the five rulers. The large rock at Beth-shemesh, where they set the Ark of the LORD, still stands in the field of Joshua as a witness to what happened there.",

      "6": "So they gathered at Mizpah and, in a great ceremony, drew water from a well and poured it out before the LORD. They also went without food all day and confessed that they had sinned against the LORD. (It was at Mizpah that Samuel became Israel’s judge.)",
      "7": "When the Philistine rulers heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah, they mobilized their army and advanced. The Israelites were badly frightened when they learned that the Philistines were approaching.",
      "8": "“Don’t stop pleading with the LORD our God to save us from the Philistines!” they begged Samuel.",

      "12": "Samuel then took a large stone and placed it between the towns of Mizpah and Jeshanah. He named it Ebenezer (which means “the stone of help”), for he said, “Up to this point the LORD has helped us!”",
      "13": "So the Philistines were subdued and didn’t invade Israel again for some time. And throughout Samuel’s lifetime, the LORD’s powerful hand was raised against the Philistines.",

      "9": "Do as they ask, but solemnly warn them about the way a king will reign over them.”",
      "10": "So Samuel passed on the LORD’s warning to the people who were asking him for a king.",
      "11": "“This is how a king will reign over you,” Samuel said. “The king will draft your sons and assign them to his chariots and his charioteers, making them run before his chariots.",
      "12": "Some will be generals and captains in his army, some will be forced to plow in his fields and harvest his crops, and some will make his weapons and chariot equipment.",

      "14": "He will take away the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his own officials.",
      "15": "He will take a tenth of your grain and your grape harvest and distribute it among his officers and attendants.",
      "16": "He will take your male and female slaves and demand the finest of your cattle and donkeys for his own use.",
      "17": "He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you will be his slaves.",

He gouged out the right eye of each of the Israelites living there, and he didn’t allow anyone to come and rescue them. In fact, of all the Israelites east of the Jordan, there wasn’t a single one whose right eye Nahash had not gouged out.

      "3": "Among Saul’s men was Ahijah the priest, who was wearing the ephod, the priestly vest. Ahijah was the son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD who had served at Shiloh. No one realized that Jonathan had left the Israelite camp.",
      "4": "To reach the Philistine outpost, Jonathan had to go down between two rocky cliffs that were called Bozez and Seneh.",
      "5": "The cliff on the north was in front of Micmash, and the one on the south was in front of Geba.",
      "6": "“Let’s go across to the outpost of those pagans,” Jonathan said to his armor bearer. “Perhaps the LORD will help us, for nothing can hinder the LORD. He can win a battle whether he has many warriors or only a few!”",
      "7": "“Do what you think is best,” the armor bearer replied. “I’m with you completely, whatever you decide.”",
      "8": "“All right, then,” Jonathan told him. “We will cross over and let them see us.",
      "9": "If they say to us, ‘Stay where you are or we’ll kill you,’ then we will stop and not go up to them.",
      "10": "But if they say, ‘Come on up and fight,’ then we will go up. That will be the LORD’s sign that he will help us defeat them.”",
      "11": "When the Philistines saw them coming, they shouted, “Look! The Hebrews are crawling out of their holes!”",
      "12": "Then the men from the outpost shouted to Jonathan, “Come on up here, and we’ll teach you a lesson!” “Come on, climb right behind me,” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “for the LORD will help us defeat them!”",
      "13": "So they climbed up using both hands and feet, and the Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer killed those who came behind them.",
      "14": "They killed some twenty men in all, and their bodies were scattered over about half an acre.",
      "15": "Suddenly, panic broke out in the Philistine army, both in the camp and in the field, including even the outposts and raiding parties. And just then an earthquake struck, and everyone was terrified.",
      "16": "Saul’s lookouts in Gibeah of Benjamin saw a strange sight—the vast army of Philistines began to melt away in every direction.",
      "17": "“Call the roll and find out who’s missing,” Saul ordered. And when they checked, they found that Jonathan and his armor bearer were gone.",
      "18": "Then Saul shouted to Ahijah, “Bring the ephod here!” For at that time Ahijah was wearing the ephod in front of the Israelites.",
      "19": "But while Saul was talking to the priest, the confusion in the Philistine camp grew louder and louder. So Saul said to the priest, “Never mind; let’s get going!”",

      "26": "They didn’t dare touch the honey because they all feared the oath they had taken.",
      "27": "But Jonathan had not heard his father’s command, and he dipped the end of his stick into a piece of honeycomb and ate the honey. After he had eaten it, he felt refreshed.",
      "28": "But one of the men saw him and said, “Your father made the army take a strict oath that anyone who eats food today will be cursed. That is why everyone is weary and faint.”",
      "29": "“My father has made trouble for us all!” Jonathan exclaimed. “A command like that only hurts us. See how refreshed I am now that I have eaten this little bit of honey.",
      "30": "If the men had been allowed to eat freely from the food they found among our enemies, think how many more Philistines we could have killed!”",

      "34": "Then go out among the troops and tell them, ‘Bring the cattle, sheep, and goats here to me. Kill them here, and drain the blood before you eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.’” So that night all the troops brought their animals and slaughtered them there.",
      "35": "Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first of the altars he built to the LORD.",
      "36": "Then Saul said, “Let’s chase the Philistines all night and plunder them until sunrise. Let’s destroy every last one of them.” His men replied, “We’ll do whatever you think is best.” But the priest said, “Let’s ask God first.”",
      "37": "So Saul asked God, “Should we go after the Philistines? Will you help us defeat them?” But God made no reply that day.",
      "38": "Then Saul said to the leaders, “Something’s wrong! I want all my army commanders to come here. We must find out what sin was committed today.",
      "39": "I vow by the name of the LORD who rescued Israel that the sinner will surely die, even if it is my own son Jonathan!” But no one would tell him what the trouble was.",
      "40": "Then Saul said, “Jonathan and I will stand over here, and all of you stand over there.” And the people responded to Saul, “Whatever you think is best.”",
      "41": "Then Saul prayed, “O LORD, God of Israel, please show us who is guilty and who is innocent.” Then they cast sacred lots, and Jonathan and Saul were chosen as the guilty ones, and the people were declared innocent.",
      "42": "Then Saul said, “Now cast lots again and choose between me and Jonathan.” And Jonathan was shown to be the guilty one.",
      "43": "“Tell me what you have done,” Saul demanded of Jonathan. “I tasted a little honey,” Jonathan admitted. “It was only a little bit on the end of my stick. Does that deserve death?”",
      "44": "“Yes, Jonathan,” Saul said, “you must die! May God strike me and even kill me if you do not die for this.”",
      "45": "But the people broke in and said to Saul, “Jonathan has won this great victory for Israel. Should he die? Far from it! As surely as the LORD lives, not one hair on his head will be touched, for God helped him do a great deed today.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.",
      "46": "Then Saul called back the army from chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines returned home.",
      "47": "Now when Saul had secured his grasp on Israel’s throne, he fought against his enemies in every direction—against Moab, Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. And wherever he turned, he was victorious.",
      "48": "He performed great deeds and conquered the Amalekites, saving Israel from all those who had plundered them.",

      "20": "“But I did obey the LORD,” Saul insisted. “I carried out the mission he gave me. I brought back King Agag, but I destroyed everyone else.",

But first you must prove yourself to be a real warrior by fighting the LORD’s battles.” For Saul thought, “I’ll send him out against the Philistines and let them kill him rather than doing it myself.”",

      "3": "This man’s name was Nabal, and his wife, Abigail, was a sensible and beautiful woman. But Nabal, a descendant of Caleb, was crude and mean in all his dealings.",
      "4": "When David heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep,",
      "5": "he sent ten of his young men to Carmel with this message for Nabal:",
      "6": "“Peace and prosperity to you, your family, and everything you own!",
      "7": "I am told that it is sheep-shearing time. While your shepherds stayed among us near Carmel, we never harmed them, and nothing was ever stolen from them.",
      "8": "Ask your own men, and they will tell you this is true. So would you be kind to us, since we have come at a time of celebration? Please share any provisions you might have on hand with us and with your friend David.”",
      "9": "David’s young men gave this message to Nabal in David’s name, and they waited for a reply.",
      "10": "“Who is this fellow David?” Nabal sneered to the young men. “Who does this son of Jesse think he is? There are lots of servants these days who run away from their masters.",
      "11": "Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I’ve slaughtered for my shearers and give it to a band of outlaws who come from who knows where?”",
      "12": "So David’s young men returned and told him what Nabal had said.",
      "13": "“Get your swords!” was David’s reply as he strapped on his own. Then 400 men started off with David, and 200 remained behind to guard their equipment.",
      "14": "Meanwhile, one of Nabal’s servants went to Abigail and told her, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he screamed insults at them.",
      "15": "These men have been very good to us, and we never suffered any harm from them. Nothing was stolen from us the whole time they were with us.",
      "16": "In fact, day and night they were like a wall of protection to us and the sheep.",
      "17": "You need to know this and figure out what to do, for there is going to be trouble for our master and his whole family. He’s so ill-tempered that no one can even talk to him!”",
      "18": "Abigail wasted no time. She quickly gathered 200 loaves of bread, two wineskins full of wine, five sheep that had been slaughtered, nearly a bushel of roasted grain, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 fig cakes. She packed them on donkeys",
      "19": "and said to her servants, “Go on ahead. I will follow you shortly.” But she didn’t tell her husband Nabal what she was doing.",
      "20": "As she was riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, she saw David and his men coming toward her.",
      "21": "David had just been saying, “A lot of good it did to help this fellow. We protected his flocks in the wilderness, and nothing he owned was lost or stolen. But he has repaid me evil for good.",
      "22": "May God strike me and kill me if even one man of his household is still alive tomorrow morning!”",
      "23": "When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed low before him.",
      "24": "She fell at his feet and said, “I accept all blame in this matter, my lord. Please listen to what I have to say.",
      "25": "I know Nabal is a wicked and ill-tempered man; please don’t pay any attention to him. He is a fool, just as his name suggests. But I never even saw the young men you sent.",
      "26": "“Now, my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, since the LORD has kept you from murdering and taking vengeance into your own hands, let all your enemies and those who try to harm you be as cursed as Nabal is.",
      "27": "And here is a present that I, your servant, have brought to you and your young men.",
      "28": "Please forgive me if I have offended you in any way. The LORD will surely reward you with a lasting dynasty, for you are fighting the LORD’s battles. And you have not done wrong throughout your entire life.",
      "29": "“Even when you are chased by those who seek to kill you, your life is safe in the care of the LORD your God, secure in his treasure pouch! But the lives of your enemies will disappear like stones shot from a sling!",
      "30": "When the LORD has done all he promised and has made you leader of Israel,",
      "31": "don’t let this be a blemish on your record. Then your conscience won’t have to bear the staggering burden of needless bloodshed and vengeance. And when the LORD has done these great things for you, please remember me, your servant!”",
      "32": "David replied to Abigail, “Praise the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you to meet me today!",
      "33": "Thank God for your good sense! Bless you for keeping me from murder and from carrying out vengeance with my own hands.",
      "34": "For I swear by the LORD, the God of Israel, who has kept me from hurting you, that if you had not hurried out to meet me, not one of Nabal’s men would still be alive tomorrow morning.”",
      "35": "Then David accepted her present and told her, “Return home in peace. I have heard what you said. We will not kill your husband.”",
      "36": "When Abigail arrived home, she found that Nabal was throwing a big party and was celebrating like a king. He was very drunk, so she didn’t tell him anything about her meeting with David until dawn the next day.",
      "37": "In the morning when Nabal was sober, his wife told him what had happened. As a result he had a stroke, and he lay paralyzed on his bed like a stone.",
      "38": "About ten days later, the LORD struck him, and he died.",
      "39": "When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise the LORD, who has avenged the insult I received from Nabal and has kept me from doing it myself. Nabal has received the punishment for his sin.” Then David sent messengers to Abigail to ask her to become his wife.",
      "40": "When the messengers arrived at Carmel, they told Abigail, “David has sent us to take you back to marry him.”",
      "41": "She bowed low to the ground and responded, “I, your servant, would be happy to marry David. I would even be willing to become a slave, washing the feet of his servants!”",
      "42": "Quickly getting ready, she took along five of her servant girls as attendants, mounted her donkey, and went with David’s messengers. And so she became his wife.",
      "43": "David also married Ahinoam from Jezreel, making both of them his wives.",
      "44": "Saul, meanwhile, had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to a man from Gallim named Palti son of Laish."

      "1": "Now some men from Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah to tell him, “David is hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which overlooks Jeshimon.”",
      "2": "So Saul took 3,000 of Israel’s elite troops and went to hunt him down in the wilderness of Ziph.",
      "3": "Saul camped along the road beside the hill of Hakilah, near Jeshimon, where David was hiding. When David learned that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,",
      "4": "he sent out spies to verify the report of Saul’s arrival.",
      "5": "David slipped over to Saul’s camp one night to look around. Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of his army, were sleeping inside a ring formed by the slumbering warriors.",
      "6": "“Who will volunteer to go in there with me?” David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother. “I’ll go with you,” Abishai replied.",
      "7": "So David and Abishai went right into Saul’s camp and found him asleep, with his spear stuck in the ground beside his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying asleep around him.",
      "8": "“God has surely handed your enemy over to you this time!” Abishai whispered to David. “Let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won’t need to strike twice!”",
      "9": "“No!” David said. “Don’t kill him. For who can remain innocent after attacking the LORD’s anointed one?",
      "10": "Surely the LORD will strike Saul down someday, or he will die of old age or in battle.",
      "11": "The LORD forbid that I should kill the one he has anointed! But take his spear and that jug of water beside his head, and then let’s get out of here!”",
      "12": "So David took the spear and jug of water that were near Saul’s head. Then he and Abishai got away without anyone seeing them or even waking up, because the LORD had put Saul’s men into a deep sleep.",
      "13": "David climbed the hill opposite the camp until he was at a safe distance.",
      "14": "Then he shouted down to the soldiers and to Abner son of Ner, “Wake up, Abner!” “Who is it?” Abner demanded.",
      "15": "“Well, Abner, you’re a great man, aren’t you?” David taunted. “Where in all Israel is there anyone as mighty? So why haven’t you guarded your master the king when someone came to kill him?",
      "16": "This isn’t good at all! I swear by the LORD that you and your men deserve to die, because you failed to protect your master, the LORD’s anointed! Look around! Where are the king’s spear and the jug of water that were beside his head?”",
      "17": "Saul recognized David’s voice and called out, “Is that you, my son David?” And David replied, “Yes, my lord the king.",
      "18": "Why are you chasing me? What have I done? What is my crime?",
      "19": "But now let my lord the king listen to his servant. If the LORD has stirred you up against me, then let him accept my offering. But if this is simply a human scheme, then may those involved be cursed by the LORD. For they have driven me from my home, so I can no longer live among the LORD’s people, and they have said, ‘Go, worship pagan gods.’",
      "20": "Must I die on foreign soil, far from the presence of the LORD? Why has the king of Israel come out to search for a single flea? Why does he hunt me down like a partridge on the mountains?”",
      "21": "Then Saul confessed, “I have sinned. Come back home, my son, and I will no longer try to harm you, for you valued my life today. I have been a fool and very, very wrong.”",
      "22": "“Here is your spear, O king,” David replied. “Let one of your young men come over and get it.",
      "23": "The LORD gives his own reward for doing good and for being loyal, and I refused to kill you even when the LORD placed you in my power, for you are the LORD’s anointed one.",
      "24": "Now may the LORD value my life, even as I have valued yours today. May he rescue me from all my troubles.”",
      "25": "And Saul said to David, “Blessings on you, my son David. You will do many heroic deeds, and you will surely succeed.” Then David went away, and Saul returned home."
