      "6": "\"Is he well?\" Jacob asked. They replied, \"He is well. Now look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.\"",
      "7": "Then Jacob said, \"Since it is still the middle of the day, it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. You should water the sheep and then go and let them graze some more.\"",
      "8": "\"We can't,\" they said, \"until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled off the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep.\"",
      "9": "While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, for she was tending them.",
      "10": "When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, and the sheep of his uncle Laban, he went over and rolled the stone off the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of his uncle Laban.",

      "12": "When Jacob explained to Rachel that he was a relative of her father and the son of Rebekah, she ran and told her father.",

      "14": "Then Laban said to him, \"You are indeed my own flesh and blood.\" So Jacob stayed with him for a month.",
      "15": "Then Laban said to Jacob, \"Should you work for me for nothing because you are my relative? Tell me what your wages should be.\"",

      "27": "Complete my older daughter's bridal week. Then we will give you the younger one too, in exchange for seven more years of work.\"",

      "16": "When Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, \"You must sleep with me because I have paid for your services with my son's mandrakes.\" So he had marital relations with her that night.",

      "34": "\"Agreed!\" said Laban, \"It will be as you say.\"",

      "38": "Then he set up the peeled branches in all the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. He set up the branches in front of the flocks when they were in heat and came to drink.",
      "39": "When the sheep mated in front of the branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.",
      "40": "Jacob removed these lambs, but he made the rest of the flock face the streaked and completely dark-colored animals in Laban's flock. So he made separate flocks for himself and did not mix them with Laban's flocks.",
      "41": "When the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would set up the branches in the troughs in front of the flock, so they would mate near the branches.",
      "42": "But if the animals were weaker, he did not set the branches there. So the weaker animals ended up belonging to Laban and the stronger animals to Jacob.",

      "16": "Surely all the wealth that God snatched away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So now do everything God has told you.\"",

      "23": "So he took his relatives with him and pursued Jacob for seven days. He caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.",

      "28": "You didn't even allow me to kiss my daughters and my grandchildren good-bye. You have acted foolishly!",
      "29": "I have the power to do you harm, but the God of your father told me last night, 'Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob.'",
      "30": "Now I understand that you have gone away because you longed desperately for your father's house. Yet why did you steal my gods?\"",
      "31": "\"I left secretly because I was afraid!\" Jacob replied to Laban. \"I thought you might take your daughters away from me by force.",
      "32": "Whoever has taken your gods will be put to death! In the presence of our relatives identify whatever is yours and take it.\" (Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.)",

      "41": "This was my lot for twenty years in your house: I worked like a slave for you--fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, but you changed my wages ten times!",

      "43": "Laban replied to Jacob, \"These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks. All that you see belongs to me. But how can I harm these daughters of mine today or the children to whom they have given birth?",
      "44": "So now, come, let's make a formal agreement, you and I, and it will be proof that we have made peace.\"",
      "45": "So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial pillar.",
