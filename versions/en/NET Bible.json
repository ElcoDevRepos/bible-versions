      "7": "Then Jacob said, \"Since it is still the middle of the day, it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. You should water the sheep and then go and let them graze some more.\"",
      "8": "\"We can't,\" they said, \"until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled off the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep.\"",
      "9": "While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, for she was tending them.",

      "16": "When Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, \"You must sleep with me because I have paid for your services with my son's mandrakes.\" So he had marital relations with her that night.",

      "39": "When the sheep mated in front of the branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.",
      "40": "Jacob removed these lambs, but he made the rest of the flock face the streaked and completely dark-colored animals in Laban's flock. So he made separate flocks for himself and did not mix them with Laban's flocks.",

      "42": "But if the animals were weaker, he did not set the branches there. So the weaker animals ended up belonging to Laban and the stronger animals to Jacob.",

      "29": "I have the power to do you harm, but the God of your father told me last night, 'Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob.'",

      "3": "Absalom would then say to him, \"Look, your claims are legitimate and appropriate. But there is no representative of the king who will listen to you.\"",
      "4": "Absalom would then say, \"If only they would make me a judge in the land! Then everyone who had a judicial complaint could come to me and I would make sure he receives a just settlement.\"",
      "5": "When someone approached to bow before him, Absalom would extend his hand and embrace him and kiss him.",
      "6": "Absalom acted this way toward everyone in Israel who came to the king for justice. In this way Absalom won the loyalty of the citizens of Israel.",
      "7": "After four years Absalom said to the king, \"Let me go and repay my vow that I made to the LORD while I was in Hebron.",
      "8": "For I made this vow when I was living in Geshur in Aram: 'If the LORD really does allow me to return to Jerusalem, I will serve the LORD.'\"",
      "9": "The king replied to him, \"Go in peace.\" So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.",
      "10": "Then Absalom sent spies through all the tribes of Israel who said, \"When you hear the sound of the horn, you may assume that Absalom rules in Hebron.\"",
      "11": "Now two hundred men had gone with Absalom from Jerusalem. Since they were invited, they went naively and were unaware of what Absalom was planning.",
      "12": "While he was offering sacrifices, Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's adviser, to come from his city, Giloh. The conspiracy was gaining momentum, and the people were starting to side with Absalom.",
      "13": "Then a messenger came to David and reported, \"The men of Israel are loyal to Absalom!\"",
      "14": "So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, \"Come on! Let's escape! Otherwise no one will be delivered from Absalom! Go immediately, or else he will quickly overtake us and bring disaster on us and kill the city's residents with the sword.\"",
      "15": "The king's servants replied to the king, \"We will do whatever our lord the king decides.\"",
      "16": "So the king and all the members of his royal court set out on foot, though the king left behind ten concubines to attend to the palace.",
      "17": "The king and all the people set out on foot, pausing at a spot some distance away.",
      "18": "All his servants were leaving with him, along with all the Kerethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites--some six hundred men who had come on foot from Gath. They were leaving with the king.",
      "19": "Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, \"Why should you come with us? Go back and stay with the new king, for you are a foreigner and an exile from your own country.",
      "20": "It seems like you arrived just yesterday. Today should I make you wander around by going with us? I go where I must go. But as for you, go back and take your men with you. May genuine loyal love protect you!\"",
      "21": "But Ittai replied to the king, \"As surely as the LORD lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king is, whether dead or alive, there I will be as well!\"",
      "22": "So David said to Ittai, \"Come along then.\" So Ittai the Gittite went along, accompanied by all his men and all the dependents who were with him.",
      "23": "All the land was weeping loudly as all these people were leaving. As the king was crossing over the Kidron Valley, all the people were leaving on the road that leads to the desert.",
      "24": "Zadok and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. When they positioned the ark of God, Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.",
      "25": "Then the king said to Zadok, \"Take the ark of God back to the city. If I find favor in the LORD's sight he will bring me back and enable me to see both it and his dwelling place again.",
      "26": "However, if he should say, 'I do not take pleasure in you,' then he will deal with me in a way that he considers appropriate.\"",
      "27": "The king said to Zadok the priest, \"Are you a seer? Go back to the city in peace! Your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan may go with you and Abiathar.",
      "28": "Look, I will be waiting at the fords of the desert until word from you reaches me.\"",
      "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there.",
      "30": "As David was going up the Mount of Olives, he was weeping as he went; his head was covered and his feet were bare. All the people who were with him also had their heads covered and were weeping as they went up.",
      "31": "Now David had been told, \"Ahithophel has sided with the conspirators who are with Absalom. So David prayed, \"Make the advice of Ahithophel foolish, O LORD!\"",
      "32": "When David reached the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite met him with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.",
      "33": "David said to him, \"If you leave with me you will be a burden to me.",
      "34": "But you will be able to counter the advice of Ahithophel if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king! Previously I was your father's servant, and now I will be your servant.'",
      "35": "Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you. Everything you hear in the king's palace you must tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",
      "36": "Furthermore, their two sons are there with them, Zadok's son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan. You must send them to me with any information you hear.\"",
      "37": "So David's friend Hushai arrived in the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem."

    "16": {
      "1": "When David had gone a short way beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a couple of donkeys that were saddled, and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred raisin cakes, a hundred baskets of summer fruit, and a container of wine.",
      "2": "The king asked Ziba, \"Why did you bring these things?\" Ziba replied, \"The donkeys are for the king's family to ride on, the loaves of bread and the summer fruit are for the attendants to eat, and the wine is for those who get exhausted in the desert.\"",
      "3": "The king asked, \"Where is your master's grandson?\" Ziba replied to the king, \"He remains in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will give back to me my grandfather's kingdom.'\"",
      "4": "The king said to Ziba, \"Everything that was Mephibosheth's now belongs to you.\" Ziba replied, \"I bow before you. May I find favor in your sight, my lord the king.\"",
      "5": "Then King David reached Bahurim. There a man from Saul's extended family named Shimei son of Gera came out, yelling curses as he approached.",
      "6": "He threw stones at David and all of King David's servants, as well as all the people and the soldiers who were on his right and on his left.",
      "7": "As he yelled curses, Shimei said, \"Leave! Leave! You man of bloodshed, you wicked man!",
      "8": "The LORD has punished you for all the spilled blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you rule. Now the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. Disaster has overtaken you, for you are a man of bloodshed!\"",
      "9": "Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, \"Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!\"",
      "10": "But the king said, \"What do we have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses because the LORD has said to him, 'Curse David!', who can say to him, 'Why have you done this?'\"",
      "11": "Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, \"My own son, my very own flesh and blood, is trying to take my life. So also now this Benjaminite! Leave him alone so that he can curse, for the LORD has spoken to him.",
      "12": "Perhaps the LORD will notice my affliction and this day grant me good in place of his curse.\"",
      "13": "So David and his men went on their way. But Shimei kept going along the side of the hill opposite him, yelling curses as he threw stones and dirt at them.",
      "14": "The king and all the people who were with him arrived exhausted at their destination, where David refreshed himself.",
      "15": "Now when Absalom and all the men of Israel arrived in Jerusalem, Ahithophel was with him.",
      "16": "When David's friend Hushai the Arkite came to Absalom, Hushai said to him, \"Long live the king! Long live the king!\"",
      "17": "Absalom said to Hushai, \"Do you call this loyalty to your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?\"",
      "18": "Hushai replied to Absalom, \"No, I will be loyal to the one whom the LORD, these people, and all the men of Israel have chosen.",
      "19": "Moreover, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.\"",
      "20": "Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, \"Give us your advice. What should we do?\"",
      "21": "Ahithophel replied to Absalom, \"Have sex with your father's concubines whom he left to care for the palace. All Israel will hear that you have made yourself repulsive to your father. Then your followers will be motivated to support you.\"",
      "22": "So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom had sex with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.",
      "23": "In those days Ahithophel's advice was considered as valuable as a prophetic revelation. Both David and Absalom highly regarded the advice of Ahithophel."

      "3": "and will bring the entire army back to you. In exchange for the life of the man you are seeking, you will get back everyone. The entire army will return unharmed.\"",
      "4": "This seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all the leaders of Israel.",

      "6": "So Hushai came to Absalom. Absalom said to him, \"Here is what Ahithophel has advised. Should we follow his advice? If not, what would you recommend?\"",
      "7": "Hushai replied to Absalom, \"Ahithophel's advice is not sound this time.\"",
      "8": "Hushai went on to say, \"You know your father and his men--they are soldiers and are as dangerous as a bear out in the wild that has been robbed of her cubs. Your father is an experienced soldier; he will not stay overnight with the army.",
      "9": "At this very moment he is hiding out in one of the caves or in some other similar place. If it should turn out that he attacks our troops first, whoever hears about it will say, 'Absalom's army has been slaughtered!'",
      "10": "If that happens even the bravest soldier--one who is lion-hearted--will virtually melt away. For all Israel knows that your father is a warrior and that those who are with him are brave.",
      "11": "My advice therefore is this: Let all Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba--in number like the sand by the sea!--be mustered to you, and you lead them personally into battle.",
      "12": "We will come against him wherever he happens to be found. We will descend on him like the dew falls on the ground. Neither he nor any of the men who are with him will be spared alive--not one of them!",
      "13": "If he regroups in a city, all Israel will take up ropes to that city and drag it down to the valley, so that not a single pebble will be left there!\"",
      "14": "Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, \"The advice of Hushai the Arkite sounds better than the advice of Ahithophel.\" Now the LORD had decided to frustrate the sound advice of Ahithophel, so that the LORD could bring disaster on Absalom.",
      "15": "Then Hushai reported to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, \"Here is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the leaders of Israel to do, and here is what I have advised.",

      "17": "Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying in En Rogel. A female servant would go and inform them, and they would then go and inform King David. It was not advisable for them to be seen going into the city.",
      "18": "But a young man saw them on one occasion and informed Absalom. So the two of them quickly departed and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. There was a well in his courtyard, and they got down in it.",
      "19": "His wife then took the covering and spread it over the top of the well and scattered some grain over it. No one was aware of what she had done.",
      "20": "When the servants of Absalom approached the woman at her home, they asked, \"Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?\" The woman replied to them, \"They crossed over the stream.\" Absalom's men searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.",
      "21": "After the men had left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed out of the well. Then they left and informed King David. They advised David, \"Get up and cross the stream quickly, for Ahithophel has devised a plan to catch you.\"",
      "22": "So David and all the people who were with him got up and crossed the Jordan River. By dawn there was not one person left who had not crossed the Jordan.",
      "23": "When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and returned to his house in his hometown. After setting his household in order, he hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the grave of his father.",
      "24": "Meanwhile David had gone to Mahanaim, while Absalom and all the men of Israel had crossed the Jordan River.",
      "25": "Absalom had made Amasa general in command of the army in place of Joab. (Now Amasa was the son of an Israelite man named Jether, who had married Abigail the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.)",

      "3": "But the soldiers replied, \"You should not do this! For if we should have to make a rapid retreat, they won't be too concerned about us. Even if half of us should die, they won't be too concerned about us. But you are like ten thousand of us! So it is better if you remain in the city for support.\"",

      "12": "The man replied to Joab, \"Even if I were receiving a thousand pieces of silver, I would not strike the king's son! In our very presence the king gave this order to you and Abishai and Ittai, 'Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.'",
      "13": "If I had acted at risk of my own life--and nothing is hidden from the king!--you would have abandoned me.\"",
      "14": "Joab replied, \"I will not wait around like this for you!\" He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the middle of Absalom while he was still alive in the middle of the oak tree.",
      "15": "Then ten soldiers who were Joab's armor bearers struck Absalom and finished him off.",
      "16": "Then Joab blew the trumpet and the army turned back from chasing Israel, for Joab had called for the army to halt.",
      "17": "They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and stacked a huge pile of stones over him. In the meantime all the Israelite soldiers fled to their homes.",
      "18": "Prior to this Absalom had set up a monument and dedicated it to himself in the King's Valley, reasoning \"I have no son who will carry on my name.\" He named the monument after himself, and to this day it is known as Absalom's Memorial.",

      "7": "So get up now and go out and give some encouragement to your servants. For I swear by the LORD that if you don't go out there, not a single man will stay here with you tonight! This disaster will be worse for you than any disaster that has overtaken you from your youth right to the present time!\"",

      "1": "The following events happened in the days of Ahasuerus. (I am referring to that Ahasuerus who used to rule over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces extending all the way from India to Ethiopia.)",
      "2": "In those days, as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa the citadel,",
      "3": "in the third year of his reign he provided a banquet for all his officials and his servants. The army of Persia and Media was present, as well as the nobles and the officials of the provinces.",
      "4": "He displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his majestic greatness for a lengthy period of time--a hundred and eighty days, to be exact!",
      "5": "When those days were completed, the king then provided a seven-day banquet for all the people who were present in Susa the citadel, for those of highest standing to the most lowly. It was held in the court located in the garden of the royal palace.",
      "6": "The furnishings included linen and purple curtains hung by cords of the finest linen and purple wool on silver rings, alabaster columns, gold and silver couches displayed on a floor made of valuable stones of alabaster, mother-of-pearl, and mineral stone.",
      "7": "Drinks were served in golden containers, all of which differed from one another. Royal wine was available in abundance at the king's expense.",
      "8": "There were no restrictions on the drinking, for the king had instructed all of his supervisors that they should do as everyone so desired.",
      "9": "Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in King Ahasuerus' royal palace.",
      "10": "On the seventh day, as King Ahasuerus was feeling the effects of the wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who attended him,",
      "11": "to bring Queen Vashti into the king's presence wearing her royal high turban. He wanted to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very attractive.",
      "12": "But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's bidding conveyed through the eunuchs. Then the king became extremely angry, and his rage consumed him.",
      "13": "The king then inquired of the wise men who were discerners of the times--for it was the royal custom to confer with all those who were proficient in laws and legalities.",
      "14": "Those who were closest to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These men were the seven officials of Persia and Media who saw the king on a regular basis and had the most prominent offices in the kingdom.",
      "15": "The king asked, \"By law, what should be done to Queen Vashti in light of the fact that she has not obeyed the instructions of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs?\"",
      "16": "Memucan then replied to the king and the officials, \"The wrong of Queen Vashti is not against the king alone, but against all the officials and all the people who are throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.",
      "17": "For the matter concerning the queen will spread to all the women, leading them to treat their husbands with contempt, saying, 'When King Ahasuerus gave orders to bring Queen Vashti into his presence, she would not come.'",
      "18": "And this very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard the matter concerning the queen will respond in the same way to all the royal officials, and there will be more than enough contempt and anger!",
      "19": "If the king is so inclined, let a royal edict go forth from him, and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media that cannot be repealed, that Vashti may not come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king convey her royalty to another who is more deserving than she.",
      "20": "And let the king's decision which he will enact be disseminated throughout all his kingdom, vast though it is. Then all the women will give honor to their husbands, from the most prominent to the lowly.\"",
      "21": "The matter seemed appropriate to the king and the officials. So the king acted on the advice of Memucan.",
      "22": "He sent letters throughout all the royal provinces, to each province according to its own script and to each people according to its own language, that every man should be ruling his family and should be speaking the language of his own people."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "When these things had been accomplished and the rage of King Ahasuerus had diminished, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decided against her.",
      "2": "The king's servants who attended him said, \"Let a search be conducted in the king's behalf for attractive young women.",
      "3": "And let the king appoint officers throughout all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the attractive young women to Susa the citadel, to the harem under the authority of Hegai, the king's eunuch who oversees the women, and let him provide whatever cosmetics they desire.",
      "4": "Let the young woman whom the king finds most attractive become queen in place of Vashti.\" This seemed like a good idea to the king, so he acted accordingly.",
      "5": "Now there happened to be a Jewish man in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai. He was the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite,",
      "6": "who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried into exile with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile.",
      "7": "Now he was acting as the guardian of Hadassah (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, for neither her father nor her mother was alive. This young woman was very attractive and had a beautiful figure. When her father and mother died, Mordecai had raised her as if she were his own daughter.",
      "8": "It so happened that when the king's edict and his law became known many young women were taken to Susa the citadel to be placed under the authority of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the royal palace to be under the authority of Hegai, who was overseeing the women.",
      "9": "This young woman pleased him, and she found favor with him. He quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her rations; he also provided her with the seven specially chosen young women who were from the palace. He then transferred her and her young women to the best quarters in the harem.",
      "10": "Now Esther had not disclosed her people or her lineage, for Mordecai had instructed her not to do so.",
      "11": "And day after day Mordecai used to walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem in order to learn how Esther was doing and what might happen to her.",
      "12": "At the end of the twelve months that were required for the women, when the turn of each young woman arrived to go to King Ahasuerus--for in this way they had to fulfill their time of cosmetic treatment: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfume and various ointments used by women--",
      "13": "the woman would go to the king in the following way: Whatever she asked for would be provided for her to take with her from the harem to the royal palace.",
      "14": "In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to a separate part of the harem, to the authority of Shaashgaz the king's eunuch who was overseeing the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless the king was pleased with her and she was requested by name.",
      "15": "When it became the turn of Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai (who had raised her as if she were his own daughter) to go to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai the king's eunuch, who was overseer of the women, had recommended. Yet Esther met with the approval of all who saw her.",
      "16": "Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal residence in the tenth month (that is, the month of Tebeth) in the seventh year of his reign.",
      "17": "And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she met with his loving approval more than all the other young women. So he placed the royal high turban on her head and appointed her queen in place of Vashti.",
      "18": "Then the king prepared a large banquet for all his officials and his servants--it was actually Esther's banquet. He also set aside a holiday for the provinces, and he provided for offerings at the king's expense.",
      "19": "Now when the young women were being gathered again, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.",
      "20": "Esther was still not divulging her lineage or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her. Esther continued to do whatever Mordecai said, just as she had done when he was raising her.",
      "21": "In those days while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who protected the entrance, became angry and plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.",
      "22": "When Mordecai learned of the conspiracy, he informed Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in Mordecai's behalf.",
      "23": "The king then had the matter investigated and, finding it to be so, had the two conspirators hanged on a gallows. It was then recorded in the daily chronicles in the king's presence."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Some time later King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, exalting him and setting his position above that of all the officials who were with him.",
      "2": "As a result, all the king's servants who were at the king's gate were bowing and paying homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded. However, Mordecai did not bow, nor did he pay him homage.",
      "3": "Then the servants of the king who were at the king's gate asked Mordecai, \"Why are you violating the king's commandment?\"",
      "4": "And after they had spoken to him day after day without his paying any attention to them, they informed Haman to see whether this attitude on Mordecai's part would be permitted. Furthermore, he had disclosed to them that he was a Jew.",
      "5": "When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing or paying homage to him, he was filled with rage.",
      "6": "But the thought of striking out against Mordecai alone was repugnant to him, for he had been informed of the identity of Mordecai's people. So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews (that is, the people of Mordecai) who were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.",
      "7": "In the first month (that is, the month of Nisan), in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus' reign, pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman in order to determine a day and a month. It turned out to be the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).",
      "8": "Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, \"There is a particular people that is dispersed and spread among the inhabitants throughout all the provinces of your kingdom whose laws differ from those of all other peoples. Furthermore, they do not observe the king's laws. It is not appropriate for the king to provide a haven for them.",
      "9": "If the king is so inclined, let an edict be issued to destroy them. I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to be conveyed to the king's treasuries for the officials who carry out this business.\"",
      "10": "So the king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, who was hostile toward the Jews.",
      "11": "The king replied to Haman, \"Keep your money, and do with those people whatever you wish.\"",
      "12": "So the royal scribes were summoned in the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month. Everything Haman commanded was written to the king's satraps and governors who were in every province and to the officials of every people, province by province according to its script and people by people according to its language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written and sealed with the king's signet ring.",
      "13": "Letters were sent by the runners to all the king's provinces stating that they should destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews, from youth to elderly, both women and children, on a particular day, namely the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), and to loot and plunder their possessions.",
      "14": "A copy of this edict was to be presented as law throughout every province; it was to be made known to all the inhabitants, so that they would be prepared for this day.",
      "15": "The messengers scurried forth with the king's order. The edict was issued in Susa the citadel. While the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in an uproar!"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Now when Mordecai became aware of all that had been done, he tore his garments and put on sackcloth and ashes. He went out into the city, crying out in a loud and bitter voice.",
      "2": "But he went no further than the king's gate, for no one was permitted to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth.",
      "3": "Throughout each and every province where the king's edict and law were announced there was considerable mourning among the Jews, along with fasting, weeping, and sorrow. Sackcloth and ashes were characteristic of many.",
      "4": "When Esther's female attendants and her eunuchs came and informed her about Mordecai's behavior, the queen was overcome with anguish. Although she sent garments for Mordecai to put on so that he could remove his sackcloth, he would not accept them.",
      "5": "So Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs who had been placed at her service, and instructed him to find out the cause and reason for Mordecai's behavior.",
      "6": "So Hathach went to Mordecai at the plaza of the city in front of the king's gate.",
      "7": "Then Mordecai related to him everything that had happened to him, even the specific amount of money that Haman had offered to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews to be destroyed.",
      "8": "He also gave him a written copy of the law that had been disseminated in Susa for their destruction so that he could show it to Esther and talk to her about it. He also gave instructions that she should go to the king to implore him and petition him on behalf of her people.",
      "9": "So Hathach returned and related Mordecai's instructions to Esther.",
      "10": "Then Esther replied to Hathach with instructions for Mordecai:",
      "11": "\"All the servants of the king and the people of the king's provinces know that there is only one law applicable to any man or woman who comes uninvited to the king in the inner court--that person will be put to death, unless the king extends to him the gold scepter, permitting him to be spared. Now I have not been invited to come to the king for some thirty days!\"",
      "12": "When Esther's reply was conveyed to Mordecai,",
      "13": "he said to take back this answer to Esther:",
      "14": "\"Don't imagine that because you are part of the king's household you will be the one Jew who will escape. If you keep quiet at this time, liberation and protection for the Jews will appear from another source, while you and your father's household perish. It may very well be that you have achieved royal status for such a time as this!\"",
      "15": "Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:",
      "16": "\"Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa and fast in my behalf. Don't eat and don't drink for three days, night or day. My female attendants and I will also fast in the same way. Afterward I will go to the king, even though it violates the law. If I perish, I perish!\"",
      "17": "So Mordecai set out to do everything that Esther had instructed him."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "It so happened that on the third day Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace, opposite the king's quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.",
      "2": "When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she met with his approval. The king extended to Esther the gold scepter that was in his hand, and Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter.",
      "3": "The king said to her, \"What is on your mind, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even as much as half the kingdom will be given to you!\"",
      "4": "Esther replied, \"If the king is so inclined, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.\"",
      "5": "The king replied, \"Find Haman quickly so that we can do as Esther requests.\" So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.",
      "6": "While at the banquet of wine, the king said to Esther, \"What is your request? It shall be given to you. What is your petition? Ask for as much as half the kingdom, and it shall be done!\"",
      "7": "Esther responded, \"My request and my petition is this:",
      "8": "If I have found favor in the king's sight and if the king is inclined to grant my request and perform my petition, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet that I will prepare for them. At that time I will do as the king wishes.",
      "9": "Now Haman went forth that day pleased and very much encouraged. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king's gate, and he did not rise nor tremble in his presence, Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai.",
      "10": "But Haman restrained himself and went on to his home. He then sent for his friends to join him, along with his wife Zeresh.",
      "11": "Haman then recounted to them his fabulous wealth, his many sons, and how the king had magnified him and exalted him over the king's other officials and servants.",
      "12": "Haman said, \"Furthermore, Queen Esther invited only me to accompany the king to the banquet that she prepared! And also tomorrow I am invited along with the king.",
      "13": "Yet all of this fails to satisfy me so long as I have to see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.\"",
      "14": "Haman's wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, \"Have a gallows seventy-five feet high built, and in the morning tell the king that Mordecai should be hanged on it. Then go with the king to the banquet contented.\" It seemed like a good idea to Haman, so he had the gallows built."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Throughout that night the king was unable to sleep, so he asked for the book containing the historical records to be brought. As the records were being read in the king's presence,",
      "2": "it was found written that Mordecai had disclosed that Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who guarded the entrance, had plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.",
      "3": "The king asked, \"What great honor was bestowed on Mordecai because of this?\" The king's attendants who served him responded, \"Not a thing was done for him.\"",
      "4": "Then the king said, \"Who is that in the courtyard?\" Now Haman had come to the outer courtyard of the palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had constructed for him.",
      "5": "The king's attendants said to him, \"It is Haman who is standing in the courtyard.\" The king said, \"Let him enter.\"",
      "6": "So Haman came in, and the king said to him, \"What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?\" Haman thought to himself, \"Who is it that the king would want to honor more than me?\"",
      "7": "So Haman said to the king, \"For the man whom the king wishes to honor,",
      "8": "let them bring royal attire which the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden--one bearing the royal insignia!",
      "9": "Then let this clothing and this horse be given to one of the king's noble officials. Let him then clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him lead him about through the plaza of the city on the horse, calling before him, 'So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!'\"",
      "10": "The king then said to Haman, \"Go quickly! Take the clothing and the horse, just as you have described, and do as you just indicated to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Don't neglect a single thing of all that you have said.\"",
      "11": "So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai. He led him about on the horse throughout the plaza of the city, calling before him, \"So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!\"",
      "12": "Then Mordecai again sat at the king's gate, while Haman hurried away to his home, mournful and with a veil over his head.",
      "13": "Haman then related to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. These wise men, along with his wife Zeresh, said to him, \"If indeed this Mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is Jewish, you will not prevail against him. No, you will surely fall before him!\"",
      "14": "While they were still speaking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived. They quickly brought Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared."

    "7": {
      "1": "So the king and Haman came to dine with Queen Esther.",

      "3": "Queen Esther replied, \"If I have met with your approval, O king, and if the king is so inclined, grant me my life as my request, and my people as my petition.",
      "4": "For we have been sold--both I and my people--to destruction and to slaughter and to annihilation! If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves, I would have remained silent, for such distress would not have been sufficient for troubling the king.\"",
      "5": "Then King Ahasuerus responded to Queen Esther, \"Who is this individual? Where is this person to be found who is presumptuous enough to act in this way?\"",
      "6": "Esther replied, \"The oppressor and enemy is this evil Haman!\" Then Haman became terrified in the presence of the king and queen.",
      "7": "In rage the king arose from the banquet of wine and withdrew to the palace garden. Meanwhile, Haman stood to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he realized that the king had now determined a catastrophic end for him.",
      "8": "When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet of wine, Haman was throwing himself down on the couch where Esther was lying. The king exclaimed, \"Will he also attempt to rape the queen while I am still in the building!\" As these words left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.",
      "9": "Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs, said, \"Indeed, there is the gallows that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke out in the king's behalf. It stands near Haman's home and is seventy-five feet high.\" The king said, \"Hang him on it!\"",
      "10": "So they hanged Haman on the very gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. The king's rage then abated."

    "8": {
      "1": "On that same day King Ahasuerus gave the estate of Haman, that adversary of the Jews, to Queen Esther. Now Mordecai had come before the king, for Esther had revealed how he was related to her.",
      "2": "The king then removed his signet ring (the very one he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther designated Mordecai to be in charge of Haman's estate.",
      "3": "Then Esther again spoke with the king, falling at his feet. She wept and begged him for mercy, that he might nullify the evil of Haman the Agagite which he had intended against the Jews.",
      "4": "When the king extended to Esther the gold scepter, she arose and stood before the king.",
      "5": "She said, \"If the king is so inclined and if I have met with his approval and if the matter is agreeable to the king and if I am attractive to him, let an edict be written rescinding those recorded intentions of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote in order to destroy the Jews who are throughout all the king's provinces.",
      "6": "For how can I watch the calamity that will befall my people, and how can I watch the destruction of my relatives?\"",
      "7": "King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, \"Look, I have already given Haman's estate to Esther, and he has been hanged on the gallows because he took hostile action against the Jews.",
      "8": "Now you write in the king's name whatever in your opinion is appropriate concerning the Jews and seal it with the king's signet ring. Any decree that is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's signet ring cannot be rescinded.",
      "9": "The king's scribes were quickly summoned--in the third month (that is, the month of Sivan), on the twenty-third day. They wrote out everything that Mordecai instructed to the Jews and to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces all the way from India to Ethiopia--a hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all--to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, and to the Jews according to their own script and their own language.",
      "10": "Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's signet ring. He then sent letters by couriers on horses, who rode royal horses that were very swift.",

      "17": "Throughout every province and throughout every city where the king's edict and his law arrived, the Jews experienced happiness and joy, banquets and holidays. Many of the resident peoples pretended to be Jews, because the fear of the Jews had overcome them."

What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? What is your request? It shall be given to you. What other petition do you have? It shall be done.\"",

      "32": "As for that statue, its head was of fine gold, its chest and arms were of silver, its belly and thighs were of bronze.",
      "33": "Its legs were of iron; its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay.",
      "34": "You were watching as a stone was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its iron and clay feet, breaking them in pieces.",
      "35": "Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were broken in pieces without distinction and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors that the wind carries away. Not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a large mountain that filled the entire earth.",
      "36": "This was the dream. Now we will set forth before the king its interpretation.",
      "37": "\"You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has granted you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor.",
      "38": "Wherever human beings, wild animals, and birds of the sky live--he has given them into your power. He has given you authority over them all. You are the head of gold.",
      "39": "Now after you another kingdom will arise, one inferior to yours. Then a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule in all the earth.",
      "40": "Then there will be a fourth kingdom, one strong like iron. Just like iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything, and as iron breaks in pieces all of these metals, so it will break in pieces and crush the others.",
      "41": "In that you were seeing feet and toes partly of wet clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom. Some of the strength of iron will be in it, for you saw iron mixed with wet clay.",
      "42": "In that the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, the latter stages of this kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.",
      "43": "And in that you saw iron mixed with wet clay, so people will be mixed with one another without adhering to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay.",
      "44": "In the days of those kings the God of heaven will raise up an everlasting kingdom that will not be destroyed and a kingdom that will not be left to another people. It will break in pieces and bring about the demise of all these kingdoms. But it will stand forever.",
      "45": "You saw that a stone was cut from a mountain, but not by human hands; it smashed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold into pieces. The great God has made known to the king what will occur in the future. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is reliable.\"",
      "46": "Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed down with his face to the ground and paid homage to Daniel. He gave orders to offer sacrifice and incense to him.",
      "47": "The king replied to Daniel, \"Certainly your God is a God of gods and Lord of kings and revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery!\"",
      "48": "Then the king elevated Daniel to high position and bestowed on him many marvelous gifts. He granted him authority over the entire province of Babylon and made him the main prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.",
      "49": "And at Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the administration of the province of Babylon. Daniel himself served in the king's court."

      "12": "But there are Jewish men whom you appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon--Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego--and these men have not shown proper respect to you, O king. They don't serve your gods and they don't pay homage to the golden statue that you have erected.\"",

      "21": "So those men were tied up while still wearing their cloaks, trousers, turbans, and other clothes, and were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.",
      "22": "But since the king's command was so urgent, and the furnace was so excessively hot, the men who escorted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were killed by the leaping flames.",
      "23": "But those three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell into the furnace of blazing fire while still securely bound.",

      "27": "Once the satraps, prefects, governors, and ministers of the king had gathered around, they saw that those men were physically unharmed by the fire. The hair of their heads was not singed, nor were their trousers damaged. Not even the smell of fire was to be found on them!",

      "12": "Its foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful; on it there was food enough for all. Under it the wild animals used to seek shade, and in its branches the birds of the sky used to nest. All creatures used to feed themselves from it.",
