As a blasphemer, he spoke against Jesus Christ and the early Christian faith, which he later embraced. This aligns with <a href="/acts/26-9.htm">Acts 26:9-11</a>, where Paul admits to opposing the name of Jesus and persecuting Christians. His role as a persecutor is well-documented in <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>, where he is described as ravaging the church, entering homes, and dragging off men and women to prison. The term "violent man" underscores his aggressive actions against Christians, which he later deeply regretted. This transformation highlights the power of God's grace to change even the most hardened hearts.<p><b>yet because I had acted in ignorance and unbelief,</b><br>Paul acknowledges that his previous actions were done out of ignorance and a lack of faith. This reflects a common theme in Scripture where God shows mercy to those who sin unknowingly, as seen in <a href="/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22-29</a>, which distinguishes between unintentional sins and willful defiance. Paul's ignorance was not an excuse but a factor in God's merciful response. His unbelief was rooted in a misunderstanding of Jesus' identity and mission, which changed dramatically after his encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-19</a>).<p><b>I was shown mercy.</b><br>The mercy shown to Paul is a testament to God's grace and forgiveness. Despite his past, God chose Paul to be an apostle, demonstrating that no one is beyond redemption. This mercy is a central theme in Paul's writings, emphasizing that salvation is a gift from God, not earned by works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). Paul's experience serves as an example of the transformative power of God's mercy, encouraging believers to trust in God's ability to forgive and renew. This mercy also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6-7</a>, where God promises to open the eyes of the blind and free captives from darkness, a spiritual reality Paul experienced firsthand.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>The author of the letter to Timothy, Paul was once a fervent persecutor of Christians before his dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus.

Yet Jesus promises in <a href="/mark/3-28.htm">Mark 3:28</a>, &#8220;People can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter,&#8221; showing that even blasphemy is not beyond divine pardon.<p>- Paul&#8217;s honesty encourages us to name our own sins plainly, trusting that confession opens the door to forgiveness and transformation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a persecutor</b><p>- Saul of Tarsus terrorized believers: <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a> says he &#8220;began to destroy the church; going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.&#8221;<p>- Persecution of Christ&#8217;s body is persecution of Christ Himself. When Jesus met Saul on the Damascus road He asked, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>).<p>- <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a> prepares every disciple: &#8220;If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well.&#8221; Paul eventually bore those same wounds for Christ, proof that grace can flip a persecutor into a protector of the faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a violent man</b><p>- Paul&#8217;s violence was more than verbal; <a href="/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1</a> paints the picture: &#8220;Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a> echoes the brutality: &#8220;I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.&#8221;<p>- The gospel doesn&#8217;t merely tame outward actions; it rescues the heart that fuels them. Paul&#8217;s conversion shows that no temperament&#8212;however aggressive&#8212;is beyond the Spirit&#8217;s reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet because I had acted in ignorance and unbelief</b><p>- Ignorance did not excuse Paul&#8217;s sin, but it did highlight the blindness that kept him from recognizing Jesus as Messiah. <a href="/acts/3-17.htm">Acts 3:17</a> speaks a similar word to Israel: &#8220;I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.&#8221;<p>- Unbelief compounds ignorance. Second Corinthians 4:4 explains, &#8220;The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers.&#8221;<p>- Even in ignorance, Paul was accountable&#8212;yet God factored in his spiritual blindness when extending mercy, just as Jesus prayed on the cross, &#8220;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was shown mercy</b><p>- Mercy is the spotlight of the verse.

Paul quickly becomes an apostle to the Gentiles, proving that the Lord &#8220;is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>- What God did for Paul He is eager to do for anyone who confesses sin and turns to Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s testimony in <a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a> piles up the darkest charges&#8212;blasphemy, persecution, violence&#8212;only to showcase the brighter brilliance of divine mercy. His ignorance and unbelief underscore humanity&#8217;s need for revelation, while his dramatic rescue underscores God&#8217;s readiness to forgive and repurpose even His fiercest opponents. If grace could overflow to Paul, it can overflow to us, turning past rebellion into future service for the glory of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.</span>--In these words of bitter I self-accusation, St. Paul sums up. the characteristic features of his brilliant career as a young Pharisee leader, as a popular Jewish patriot. The <span class= "ital">object</span> of his intense hatred and of his burning antagonism during these never-to-be-forgotten days was <span class= "ital">that very Lord, </span>from whom later he had received such unspeakable gifts. He knew he had been "a blasphemer" of that dear Master in the truest sense of the terrible word, since, as it has been well said, that: "He who had seen Stephen die for Christ, and after this did not cease to pant like a wild beast for the blood of the Church, must have known that he had not been guilty of simply reviling men but of blaspheming God." And "a persecutor," for, to quote his own words at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/22-4.htm" title="And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.">Acts 22:4</a>): "I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women." (Comp., too, <a href="/acts/25-11.htm" title="For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.">Acts 25:11</a> : "I compelled them to blaspheme.") And "injurious" (or, more accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">a doer of outrage</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as he must well have remembered the events referred to in the history of the Acts (<a href="/acts/9-1.htm" title="And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,">Acts 9:1</a>) in the words: "Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord."<p><span class= "bld">But I obtained mercy.</span>--The Apostle, his heart overflowing with love and gratitude, contrasts his Master's mercy with his own want of it; the "mercy" shown to him consisting in something very different to simple forgiveness of a great wrong. In St. Paul's case the pardon was crowned by many a noble gift bestowed by that pitiful King whom he had so cruelly wronged.<p><span class= "bld">Because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</span>--This is one of the passages which throws a gleam of light on some of the hard questions which perplex us when we meditate on the principles of the final judgment. Very little is told us as to the doom of those who have not heard, or else have failed to understand, the message of Christ. Still, from even such scanty teaching as is contained in the words we are now considering, and in such passages as <a href="/context/matthew/12-31.htm" title="Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.">Matthew 12:31-32</a>; <a href="/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.">Luke 23:34</a>, we gather that there is an ignorance which at least greatly modifies the guilt of unbelief; we learn at least this much--<span class= "ital">such a sinner is not out of the pale of the operation of divine mercy</span> But in spite of these hints--for they are little more--of the almost limitless area of the divine mercy, great care must be taken not to press overmuch these blessed intimations of the <span class= "ital">possibility</span> of a mercy far more extended than the usual interpretation of the inspired utterances would lead us to expect; for, after all, the words and teaching of the merciful Redeemer Himself (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm" title="But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.">Luke 12:48</a>) seem to point to a mitigation of punishment, rather than to a complete forgiveness, of sins committed under circumstances of perhaps partial ignorance. "He that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">Though I was</span> for <span class="accented">who was</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">howbeit</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A blasphemer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); applied, as here, to persons, only in <a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2</a>; applied to words, <a href="/acts/6-11.htm">Acts 6:11, 13</a> (T.R.).
