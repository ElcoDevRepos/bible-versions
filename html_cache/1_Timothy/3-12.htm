In the cultural context of the early church, polygamy was not widely practiced among Jews, but divorce and remarriage were common. This requirement underscores the need for a deacon to demonstrate commitment and fidelity, reflecting the monogamous relationship between Christ and the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>). The phrase also implies moral purity and the ability to manage personal relationships well, which is crucial for someone in a position of spiritual authority.<p><b>a good manager of his children</b><br>The ability to manage one's children is seen as a reflection of a leader's capability to guide and nurture the church community. In biblical times, the family was the primary unit of society, and effective leadership in the home was considered indicative of one's ability to lead in the church. This requirement aligns with the broader biblical principle that leadership begins at home (<a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>). It also reflects the importance of teaching and disciplining children in the ways of the Lord, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>.<p><b>and of his own household</b><br>Managing one's household well involves stewardship of resources, maintaining order, and fostering a godly environment. In the historical context, a household could include extended family and servants, making this a significant responsibility. This phrase highlights the importance of practical wisdom and organizational skills in church leadership. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of stewardship, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where faithful management of what God has entrusted is rewarded.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, providing guidance to Timothy on church leadership.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, receiving instructions on church governance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/deacons.htm">Deacons</a></b><br>Church leaders responsible for serving the congregation and managing church affairs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was stationed, known for its diverse and challenging cultural environment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_church.htm">Early Church</a></b><br>The context in which these instructions were given, focusing on establishing order and integrity in church leadership.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/marital_faithfulness.htm">Marital Faithfulness</a></b><br>The phrase "husband of but one wife" emphasizes the importance of fidelity and commitment in marriage.
