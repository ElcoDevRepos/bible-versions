The term "hypocrisy" suggests a pretense of righteousness, masking their true intentions. In the Greco-Roman world, hypocrisy was often associated with actors wearing masks, symbolizing deceit. The Bible frequently warns against false prophets and teachers (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>, <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>), emphasizing the need for discernment. The "liars" here are those who deliberately distort the truth of the Gospel, similar to the Pharisees whom Jesus criticized for their outward piety but inward corruption (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<p><b>whose consciences are seared with a hot iron</b><br>This vivid imagery suggests a conscience that has become insensitive and unresponsive to moral truth, akin to skin that has been cauterized and lost feeling. In the ancient world, branding with a hot iron was a mark of ownership or punishment, indicating a permanent change. This metaphor implies that these individuals have become so entrenched in their deceit that they are no longer capable of feeling guilt or shame. The seared conscience is a warning of the dangers of persistent sin and rejection of truth, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>, where God gives people over to a depraved mind. This condition contrasts with the call to maintain a pure conscience before God (<a href="/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5, 19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, stationed in Ephesus, tasked with leading the church and combating false teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its diverse culture and the presence of various religious beliefs, including false teachings infiltrating the church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals within the church spreading deceptive doctrines, characterized by hypocrisy and a lack of genuine faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/conscience.htm">Conscience</a></b><br>The inner sense of right and wrong, which can become desensitized or "seared" through persistent sin and hypocrisy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_hypocrisy.htm">The Danger of Hypocrisy</a></b><br>Hypocrisy in teaching and living can lead to a seared conscience, where one becomes insensitive to sin and truth.<br><br>Christians must strive for authenticity in their faith, ensuring their actions align with their beliefs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_conscience.htm">Guarding the Conscience</a></b><br>A healthy conscience is vital for spiritual discernment and growth.

Their hypocrisy consisted in their assumption of a mask of holiness, which holiness they considered was derived from their false asceticism and their abstinence from things which the Apostle proceeded to show were lawful.<p><span class= "bld">Having their conscience seared with a hot iron.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">Branded in their own con-science as with a hot iron.</span> The image is drawn from the practice of branding slaves and certain criminals on their forehead with a mark. "<span class= "ital">Qua nota turpitudinis</span> <span class= "ital">non inusta tua vita est?" </span>(Cic. <span class= "ital">Cat.</span> i. 6.) These men tried to teach the efficacy of a substitution of certain counsels of perfection in place of a faithful loving life. They based their teaching on wild Oriental speculations about the evil nature of all matter. They were often themselves evil-livers, who, conscious of their own stained, scarred lives, strove with a show of outward sanctity and hypocritical self-denial to beguile and to lead astray others, and in the end to make them as vile as themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies</span> for <span class="accented">speaking lies in hypocrisy</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">branded in their own conscience as with</span> for <span class="accented">having their conscience seared with</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Through the hypocrisy of men</span>, etc. The construction is rather obscure, as the most obvious way of construing is that of the A.V., where <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> must agree with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. But then the clause, "having their conscience seared with a hot iron," does not suit "devils." It is therefore, perhaps, best to translate the clause as the R.V. does, and to explain, with Bishop Ellicott, that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, which precedes <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, defines the <span class="accented">instrument</span> by which they were led to give heed to seducing spirits, viz. the hypocritical preterites of the men who spake lies, and whose consciences were seared. If <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> agrees with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, we must conceive that St. Paul passes insensibly from "<span class="accented">the</span> devils" to the false teachers who spake as they taught them. In the Gospels, the speech of the devils, and of those possessed by devils, is often interchanged, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/luke/4-33.htm">Luke 4:33, 34, 41</a>; <a href="/mark/1-23.htm">Mark 1:23, 24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Men that speak lies</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>); only found here in the New Testament, but occasionally in classical Greek. Branded (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); here only in the New Testament, but used in Greek medical and other writers for "<span class="accented">to</span> brand," or "<span class="accented">cauterize</span>;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a branding-iron. The application of the image is somewhat uncertain. If the idea is that of "a brand," a mark burnt in upon the forehead of a slave or criminal, then the meaning is that these men have their own infamy stamped upon their own consciences. It is not patent only to others, but to themselves also. But if the metaphor is from the cauterizing a wound, as the A.V. takes it, then the idea is that these men's consciences are become as insensible to the touch as the skin that has been cauterized is. The metaphor, in this case, is somewhat similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>; <a href="/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>; <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>, etc.). The latter interpretation seems to suit the general context best, and the medical use of the term, which St. Paul might have learnt from Luke. The emphasis of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "their own conscience," implies that they were not merely deceivers of others, but were self-deceived. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">influenced by</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
