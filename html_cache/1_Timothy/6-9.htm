The Bible often warns against the love of money, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, where Jesus states that one cannot serve both God and money. The desire for riches can lead to idolatry, placing wealth above God. In the cultural context of the early church, wealth was often associated with power and status, which could lead believers away from their faith.<p><b>fall into temptation</b><br>Temptation is a common struggle for believers, as seen in <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, where it is described as being lured and enticed by one's own desires. The pursuit of wealth can lead to various temptations, such as dishonesty, greed, and exploitation. In the historical context, the early Christians were often tempted to conform to the materialistic values of the Roman Empire, which could compromise their witness.<p><b>and become ensnared by many foolish and harmful desires</b><br>The imagery of being ensnared suggests a trap or a snare, indicating that these desires can capture and control a person. Foolish and harmful desires are those that lack wisdom and lead to negative consequences. <a href="/proverbs/28-20.htm">Proverbs 28:20</a> warns that a faithful person will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished. The cultural context highlights the dangers of pursuing wealth without regard for spiritual and moral integrity.<p><b>that plunge them into ruin and destruction</b><br>The consequences of succumbing to these desires are severe, leading to both spiritual and potentially physical ruin. The terms "ruin" and "destruction" suggest a complete downfall, echoing the warnings found in <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>, where trusting in riches leads to a fall. This serves as a prophetic warning, emphasizing the ultimate futility of placing hope in material wealth rather than in God. The imagery of plunging suggests a sudden and overwhelming downfall, reinforcing the urgency of heeding this warning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, serving in Ephesus, who is the recipient of this letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its wealth and commerce, which may have influenced the temptations related to riches.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich.htm">The Rich</a></b><br>Individuals who desire wealth, which Paul warns against due to the spiritual dangers associated with such desires.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temptation_and_trap.htm">Temptation and Trap</a></b><br>The spiritual and moral pitfalls that accompany the pursuit of wealth, leading to destructive outcomes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_desiring_wealth.htm">The Danger of Desiring Wealth</a></b><br>The Greek word for "want" implies a deliberate intention or desire.

The cure is a heart redirected toward God&#8217;s kingdom, satisfied in His provision, and generous with His gifts. By treasuring Christ above wealth, believers escape the snare and walk in true, lasting riches.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">But they that will be rich.</span>--Here St. Paul guards against the danger of his words being then or at any future time misinterpreted by any dreamy, unpractical school of asceticism, supposing that voluntary poverty was a state of life peculiarly pleasing to the Most High--the strange mistake upon which the great Mendicant orders were organised in the Middle Ages. Those who exposed themselves to the winning temptations and deadly sins he was about to speak of were not "the rich," but those who longingly plan to be rich.<p><span class= "bld">Fall into temptation.</span>--Those longing to be rich will fall into the temptation to increase their worldly goods, even at the sacrifice of principle. Some unlawful method of gratifying their passion for gain will present itself; conscientious scruples will be thrown to the winds, and they who wish to be rich will fall into the temptation. We pray so often <span class= "ital">His</span> prayer, "Lead us not into temptation." In the same hour we long--perhaps even with the same breath we pray--that our worldly means may be increased, our position bettered, little thinking that the longing for an increase of riches and position will lead us into the most dangerous of all temptations!<p><span class= "bld">And a snare.</span>--A very tangle, as it has been well called, of conflicting motives--each fresh gratification of the ruling passion, perhaps excused under the plausible names of industry, home claims, praiseworthy and healthy enterprise, entangling the unhappy soul more completely.<p><span class= "bld">And into many foolish and hurtful lusts.</span>--The lusts or desires into which those who long to be rich fall, are well named "foolish," because in so many instances they are passionate desires for things utterly undesirable, the possession of which can afford neither pleasure nor advantage--such, for instance, is the love of hoarding wealth, so common to those men who have longed for and obtained riches; and "hurtful" often to the body as well as to the soul do these rich find their "longings," when gratified.<p><span class= "bld">Which drown men in . . .</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">which plunge men into</span> . . .<p><span class= "bld">Destruction and perdition.</span>--"Destruction" refers rather to wreck and ruin of the body, whilst "perdition" belongs rather to that more awful ruin of the eternal soul. The gratification of desires, whether these desires are centred in the lower animal passions of the table, or in the pursuit of yet baser and more selfish passions still, invariably leads to the destruction of the poor frail human body first. This premature breaking up of the earthly tabernacle is the herald and precursor of the final perdition of the immortal soul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">Desire to</span> for <span class="accented">will</span>, A.V.; a <span class="accented">temptation</span> for <span class="accented">temptation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">many</span> for <span class="accented">into many</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">such as</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A temptation</span>.

But if so, the reasoning is not good, because "temptation" implies a state, not merely a single temptation. The prefixing of the article is therefore improper. It should be "temptation," as in the A.V. and in <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>; <a href="/luke/22-40.htm">Luke 22:40</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Snare</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>); as <a href="/1_timothy/3-7.htm">1 Timothy 3:7</a>, note.
