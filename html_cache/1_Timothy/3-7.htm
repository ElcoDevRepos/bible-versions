In the early church, leaders were expected to be above reproach not only within the Christian community but also in the broader society. A good reputation with outsiders reflects the leader's integrity and consistency in living out Christian values. <a href="/proverbs/22.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a> highlights the value of a good name, and <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5-6</a> encourages believers to act wisely toward outsiders. The early church faced scrutiny and persecution, making it crucial for leaders to exemplify Christ-like behavior to avoid bringing disrepute to the faith.<p><b>so that he will not fall into disgrace</b><br>Disgrace here refers to the loss of respect and credibility, which can severely impact the leader's ability to minister effectively. In the cultural context of the Greco-Roman world, honor and shame were significant social constructs. A leader falling into disgrace would not only harm their personal ministry but could also bring shame upon the church. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>, which urges believers to live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God.<p><b>and into the snare of the devil</b><br>The snare of the devil suggests a trap set by Satan to undermine the leader's effectiveness and the church's witness. This imagery is consistent with other New Testament warnings about spiritual warfare, such as <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, which speaks of the devil's schemes. The devil's aim is to discredit leaders and, by extension, the church, as seen in the temptation of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>.

A life that is upright before unbelievers safeguards the leader, protects the church, and magnifies the Lord to a watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without.</span>--The man to be chosen as a responsible office-bearer in the Church, should be one possessing a stainless reputation for integrity and honour with the world outside the Church's pale; he should be one regarded by the world at large as having led a self-restrained, decorous life--a life free from those disorders and licentious practices which worldly men, even while themselves indulging in them, are the first to condemn in others.<p><span class= "bld">Lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</span>--For such a one, bringing with him into the new society his unhappy reputation, earned in the old thoughtless days--if placed in the new society in a prominent position of authority--would draw down upon himself and the brotherhood over whom he presided many a reproach, many a sneer. Those who once knew him among other associations living a very different life, would be only too ready to attack the blameless character of the congregation, through the stained and scarred reputation of their minister. The temptation to fall away and deny his Lord in such a case, would be overwhelming. The man might be in earnest, might be wishful to lead a new and better life, but the risk that one with such connections, with such memories of old days, would of necessity run, must be very great. Weakened and disheartened, such a presbyter would be likely to fall an easy prey into some snare skilfully laid by the Enemy, and, by his fall, cause a terrible and damaging injury to the Church of Christ. For these weighty reasons St. Paul charged Timothy to be very watchful when he chose his presiding elders, to elect only those who, in the dissolute society of Ephesus, had known how, even in old days, to preserve their good name stainless, their character unscarred.<p><span class= "bld">The snare of the devil.</span>--The teaching here of St. Paul respecting the Evil One is deserving of a special comment. What he says in <a href="/context/1_timothy/3-6.htm" title="Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.">1Timothy 3:6-7</a> is simply introduced as part of the main argument, which relates exclusively to the care to be exercised in the selection of fit persons for the sacred offices in the congregations. It is evidently not introduced as a special teaching on this mysterious subject. No disputings on this point as yet had been originated at this early period in Christian history. It lays down, however, certain broad principles which must have been the ground-work of St. Paul's belief in this now disputed question; and receiving as we do St. Paul's words in this and in his other epistles as an authoritative declaration of the mind and will of the Holy Spirit, it seems that these broad principles should have <span class= "ital">all</span> weight whenever the doctrine respecting the Spirit of Evil is discussed. The lines hero sketched are as follows: (1) The personality of the Evil One is distinctly affirmed. (2; This unhappy being has fallen and has been condemned, and is now able to lay snares for and to tempt men. (3) An overweening pride seems to have been the cause which led to this once mighty one's fall. (4) All idea of dualism--the old Persian belief adopted in the Manichsean heresy, and in so many other false creeds, that of two principles eternally opposed to one another--presiding respectively over the realms of light and darkness--is distinctly here repudiated by Paul, who in the course of his argument casually introduces the Evil One--the Enemy of man, as one who at some remote period rebelled, was crushed, and condemned, but to whom, in the supreme Providence of God, some terrible power over man was left.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">Good testimony from</span> for <span class="accented">a good report of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.

In accordance with this rule, letters testimonial are required of all persons to be ordained, to the importance of <span class="accented">character</span> in a clergyman (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Them that are without</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); used in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="/luke/11-39.htm">Luke 11:39</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>, etc., of that; which is <span class="accented">outside</span> or <span class="accented">external</span> literally, as the outside of the cup, the outer ornament of the body, the outside of the sepulcher, the outer court of the temple. It is synonymous with the more common form, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span>. (For the phrase, "they that are without" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span>), as applied to those who are not members of the Church, see <a href="/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="/john/9-34.htm">John 9:34, 35</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-12.htm">1 Corinthians 5:12, 13</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:12</a>.) The opposite is <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-12.htm">1 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25</a>, etc.). So <span class="accented">exoteric</span> and <span class="accented">esoteric</span>, of doctrines intended respectively for the outside world or the inner circle of disciples. <span class="cmt_word">Reproach</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); the reproaches and revilings cast upon him by unbelievers (<a href="/romans/15-3.htm">Romans 15:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> has the same sense (<a href="/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>; <a href="/mark/15-32.htm">Mark 15:32</a>; <a href="/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>), and so in classical Greek. This reproach is further described as the <span class="cmt_word">snare of the devil</span> (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>), because it is through these revilings that the devil seeks to impair the power of his ministry and frighten him from the exercise of it. The genitive <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> depends only upon <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, not upon <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> does not indicate that there are two separate things into which he falls, but adds, as a description of the <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, that it is "a snare of the devil." The idea in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> is analogous. There it is by <span class="accented">afflictions</span> that the devil seeks to devour the disciple who is weak in faith. Those afflictions might well be described as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>," a snare of the devil," set for weak souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Furthermore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he must</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#949;&#8150;</span> <span class="translit">(dei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1163.htm">Strong's 1163: </a> </span><span class="str2">Third person singular active present of deo; also deon deh-on'; neuter active participle of the same; both used impersonally; it is Necessary.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(echein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
