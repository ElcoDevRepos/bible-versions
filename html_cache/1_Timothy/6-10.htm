In biblical context, love for material wealth is often contrasted with love for God (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). The Greek word used here for "love of money" is "philargyria," which implies an excessive or insatiable desire for wealth. This concept is rooted in the Ten Commandments, where coveting is prohibited (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>). The love of money can lead to idolatry, as it may replace God as the primary focus of one's life.<p><b>is the root of all kinds of evil.</b><br>The phrase suggests that the love of money is a foundational cause of various evils, not the sole cause of every evil. The Greek text implies a broad range of evils, indicating that this love can lead to numerous sinful behaviors. Historically, the pursuit of wealth has led to corruption, exploitation, and injustice, as seen in the stories of Achan (Joshua 7) and Judas Iscariot (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). Theologically, this aligns with the idea that sin often stems from misplaced priorities and desires.<p><b>By craving it,</b><br>Craving indicates a strong, often uncontrollable desire. This aligns with the biblical warnings against covetousness and greed (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). The craving for wealth can become an obsession, leading individuals away from spiritual truths and values. This craving is a form of idolatry, where wealth becomes an object of worship, replacing God in one's heart.<p><b>some have wandered away from the faith</b><br>This phrase indicates a departure from Christian beliefs and practices. The imagery of wandering suggests a gradual process, often unnoticed until one is far from the intended path. In the New Testament, faith is central to the believer's life (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>), and wandering from it can lead to spiritual peril. The parable of the sower (<a href="/mark/4-18.htm">Mark 4:18-19</a>) illustrates how the deceitfulness of wealth can choke the word, making it unfruitful.<p><b>and pierced themselves with many sorrows.</b><br>The imagery of piercing suggests self-inflicted harm, emphasizing personal responsibility for the consequences of one's desires. The sorrows mentioned are the inevitable result of prioritizing wealth over spiritual well-being. This aligns with the biblical principle that sin leads to suffering (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The story of the rich young ruler (<a href="/mark/10-17.htm">Mark 10:17-22</a>) exemplifies how attachment to wealth can lead to sorrow and loss of eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and personal conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, serving in Ephesus, who received this letter as part of his pastoral training and encouragement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its wealth and commerce, which may have contributed to the temptations related to money.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_church.htm">Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in the first century, facing various challenges including false teachings and moral issues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals in the early church who were motivated by greed and were leading others astray with their teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_root_of_evil.htm">Understanding the Root of Evil</a></b><br>The verse highlights that it is not money itself, but the love of money, that is a root of all kinds of evil.

Scripture calls us to contentment, generosity, and single-hearted devotion to Christ, whose priceless riches neither fade nor fail (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">For the love of money is the root of all evil.</span>--Some would water down this strong expression by translating the Greek words by "a root of all evil," instead of "the root," making this alteration on the ground of the article not being prefixed to the Greek word rendered "root." This change, however, grammatically is unnecessary, as the article disappears before the predicate, in accordance with the well-known rule respecting subject and predicate.<p>St. Paul had just written (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1Timothy 6:9</a>) of men being plunged into destruction and perdition--the awful consequence of yielding to those lusts into which the fatal love of riches had guided them; he now sums up the teaching contained in these words by pithily remarking. "Yes, for the love of money is the root of all evil," meaning thereby, not that every evil <span class= "ital">necessarily must</span> come from "love of money," but that there is no conceivable evil which can happen to the sons and daughters of men which <span class= "ital">may</span> not spring from covetousness--a love of gold and wealth.<p><span class= "bld">Which while some coveted after.</span>--There is a slight irregularity in the image here, but the sense of the expression is perfectly clear. It is, of course, <span class= "ital">not</span> the "love of money," strictly speaking, which "some have coveted after," but the money itself. The thought in the writer's mind probably was--The man coveting gold longs for opportunities in which his covetousness (love of money) may find a field for exercise. Such inaccuracies in language are not uncommon in St. Paul's writings, as, for instance, <a href="/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?">Romans 8:24</a>, where he writes of "hope that is seen."<p><span class= "bld">They have erred from the faith.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">they have wandered away from the faith.</span> This vivid picture of some who had, for sake of a little gold, given up their first love--their faith--was evidently drawn by St. Paul from life. There were <span class= "ital">some</span> in that well-known congregation at Ephesus, once faithful, now wanderers from the flock, over whom St. Paul mourned.<p><span class= "bld">And pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span>--The language and the thoughts of <a href="/psalms/16-4.htm" title="Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.">Psalm 16:4</a> were in St. Paul's mind when he wrote these words--"Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another (god)." The "many sorrows" here are, no doubt, the "gnawings of conscience," which must ever and anon harass and perplex the man or woman who, for covetousness' sake, has deserted the old paths, and has wandered away from the old loved communion of Christ.<p>The imagery used in this tenth verse seems to be that of a man who wanders from the straight, direct path of life, to gather some poisonous, fair-seeming root growing at a distance from the right road on which he was travelling.

Moreover, the following <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) necessitates the giving a definite sense to <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span>, though it has not the article; and Alford shows dearly that a word like <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span>, especially when placed as here in an emphatic position, does not require it (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>, where in the second and third clause <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, being in the emphatic place, has not the article). Alford also quotes a striking passage from Diog. Laert., in which he mentions a saying of the philosopher Diogenes that "the love of money (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is the metropolis, or home, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>." <span class="cmt_word">Reaching after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). It has been justly remarked that the phrase is slightly inaccurate. What some reach after is not "the love of money," but the money itself. To avoid this, Hofmann (quoted by Luther) makes <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span> the antecedent to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c2;</span>, and the metaphor to be of a person turning out of his path to grasp a plant which turns out to he not desirable, but a root of bitterness. This is ingenious, but hardly to be accepted as the true interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Pierced themselves through</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and rare in classical Greek. But the simple verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, to "pierce through," "transfix," applied 'especially to "spitting" meat, is very common in Homer, who also applies it metaphorically exactly as St. Paul does here, to grief or pain. <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "pierced with pain" ('Il.,' 5:399). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
