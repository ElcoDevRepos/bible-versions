The term "elder" is rooted in Jewish tradition, where elders were respected community leaders. Effective leadership in the church involves guiding the congregation in faith and practice, akin to shepherding. This aligns with the qualifications for elders outlined in <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-7</a> and <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5-9</a>, emphasizing character and ability.<p><b>are worthy of double honor</b><br>"Double honor" suggests both respect and financial support. In the cultural context of the time, honor was a significant social currency, and providing for leaders was a practical expression of this honor. This principle is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-14.htm">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>, where Paul states that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. The dual aspect of honor underscores the value of their spiritual labor.<p><b>especially those who work hard</b><br>The phrase highlights the diligence required in ministry. The Greek term for "work hard" implies laboring to the point of exhaustion, indicating the dedication expected of church leaders. This reflects the broader biblical theme of perseverance in ministry, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>, where Timothy is urged to preach the word with patience and careful instruction.<p><b>at preaching and teaching</b><br>Preaching and teaching are central to the role of elders, focusing on proclaiming the gospel and instructing believers in sound doctrine. This dual role is crucial for the spiritual growth and maturity of the church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>, where the purpose of such gifts is to equip the saints for ministry and build up the body of Christ. The emphasis on teaching aligns with Jesus' Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where making disciples involves teaching them to obey His commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>In the early church, elders were leaders responsible for teaching, guiding, and overseeing the spiritual well-being of the congregation.

The consideration of the position and qualifications of certain ruling elder women (<span class= "ital">the presbyteral widows</span>) reminded St. Paul of certain points to be impressed on Timothy connected with the rank and honour due to the more distinguished presbyters associated with him in the Ephesian congregations.<p>Attention should be directed here to the vast powers intrusted to the "presiding presbyter" of such a Church as Ephesus (to use the <span class= "ital">title</span> of Bishop in the ecclesiastical sense would be as yet an anachronism. It probably was, however, of general use within thirty years from the date of the Epistle, certainly before the close of the century). In addition to the general office of supervisor, one in the position of Timothy evidently had the distribution of the several grades of honours and remuneration among the presbyteral order (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1Timothy 5:17</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1Timothy 5:21</a>). To him, as presiding elder, belonged the functions of supreme judge in all matters ecclesiastical and moral, relating to the varied officials of both sexes connected with the Church. The right of ordination which, when the Apostles and the first generation of believers had passed away, became the <span class= "ital">exclusive</span> work of the bishop, is here (see <a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1Timothy 5:22</a>) specially intrusted by an Apostle to Timothy, the chief presbyter and apostolic representative in the Church of Ephesus, in the words: "Lay hands suddenly on no man."<p>The elders (presbyters) to whom Timothy was to accord some special honour, were those who, in the congregations and Christian schools of so great a city as Ephesus, in addition to their many duties connected with organisation and administration, were distinguishing themselves in a marked manner by their preaching and teaching.<p>Among the devoted and earnest presbyters in these Asian churches, some there were, doubtless, who possessed the special gift of teaching, either in the class-room or the preacher's chair. Those who, possessing, well and faithfully exercised these invaluable gifts were to be in some way preferred by the chief minister. The "double honour" (<span class= "ital">time</span>) is a broad inclusive term, and seems to comprehend rank and position as well as remuneration--<span class= "ital">victu et reverentia, </span>as Melancthon paraphrases the words "double honour."

It seems that they did not necessarily teach and preach, but those who did so, laboring in the Word and teaching, were especially worthy of honor. <span class="cmt_word">Double honor</span> (see note on ver. 3) means simply increased honor, not exactly twice as much as some one else, or with arithmetical exactness. So the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>; and by the LXX. in <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>; and elsewhere also in classical Greek. And so we say, "twice as good," "twice as much," with the same indefinite meaning. <span class="cmt_word">The Word and teaching.</span> The "Word" means generally "the Word of God," as we have "preach the Word," "hear the Word," "the ministry of the Word," "doers of the Word," etc. And although there is no article before <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> here yet, considering the presence of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, and St. Paul's less careful use of the article in his later Epistles, this absence is not sufficient to counterbalance the weight of those considerations which lead to the conclusion that "laboring in the Word" refers to the Word of God. The alternative rendering of "oral discourse" <span class="accented">or</span> "in speaking" seems rather weak. <span class="cmt_word">Teaching</span> would mean catechetical instruction and similar explanatory teaching. <span class="cmt_word">Labor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); a word very frequently used by St. Paul of spiritual labors (<a href="/romans/16-6.htm">Romans 16:6, 12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/5-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Elders</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(presbyteroi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4245.htm">Strong's 4245: </a> </span><span class="str2">Comparative of presbus; older; as noun, a senior; specially, an Israelite Sanhedrist or Christian 'presbyter'.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who lead</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#8182;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proest&#333;tes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4291.htm">Strong's 4291: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pro and histemi; to stand before, i.e. to preside, or to practise.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">effectively</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kal&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2573.htm">Strong's 2573: </a> </span><span class="str2">Well, nobly, honorably, rightly.
