The concept of a "ransom" is rooted in the ancient practice of paying a price to free a slave or captive, reflecting the idea of redemption. In the Old Testament, the idea of ransom is seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a> and <a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7-8</a>, where a price is paid for deliverance. Jesus' self-giving is a fulfillment of the suffering servant prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the servant bears the iniquities of many. The universality of "for all" emphasizes the inclusive nature of Christ's atonement, aligning with <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, which speaks of God's love for the world. This phrase underscores the New Testament theme of Jesus as the mediator between God and humanity, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>.<p><b>the testimony that was given</b><br>The term "testimony" refers to the witness or declaration of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ. This testimony is not only verbal but is also demonstrated through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. In the context of the early church, this testimony was proclaimed by the apostles and early Christians, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers are called to be witnesses to the ends of the earth. The testimony of Christ's sacrifice is central to the gospel message and is affirmed by the Holy Spirit, as described in <a href="/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26-27</a>. This testimony is also prophetic, fulfilling Old Testament promises and pointing to the ultimate reconciliation of humanity with God.<p><b>at just the right time</b><br>This phrase indicates the divine timing of Christ's incarnation and sacrificial death. <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a> speaks of God sending His Son "when the fullness of time had come," suggesting that Jesus' coming was perfectly aligned with God's sovereign plan. Historically, the Roman Empire's political stability, common language (Koine Greek), and established road systems facilitated the rapid spread of the gospel. Culturally, there was a widespread expectation of a savior or deliverer, both within Judaism and in the broader Greco-Roman world. This timing also fulfilled Daniel's prophecy of the seventy weeks (<a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>), which many interpret as pointing to the Messiah's arrival. The phrase underscores God's providence and the meticulous unfolding of His redemptive plan throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who gave Himself as a ransom.
