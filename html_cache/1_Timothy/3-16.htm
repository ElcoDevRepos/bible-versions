The "mystery of godliness" refers to the profound and previously hidden truth of God's plan for salvation through Jesus Christ. In biblical terms, a "mystery" is something that was once concealed but is now revealed by God. The greatness of this mystery underscores its significance in the Christian faith, emphasizing the transformative power of the gospel. This aligns with other New Testament passages that speak of the mystery of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4-6</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>).<p><b>He appeared in the flesh,</b><br>This phrase affirms the incarnation of Jesus Christ, a foundational doctrine of Christianity. It emphasizes that Jesus, who is divine, took on human nature and lived among humanity. This is supported by <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, which states, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us." The incarnation is central to understanding Jesus' role as the mediator between God and man (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>) and fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which speaks of a virgin bearing a son called Immanuel, meaning "God with us."<p><b>was vindicated by the Spirit,</b><br>This refers to the Holy Spirit's role in affirming Jesus' divine nature and mission. The Spirit's vindication is most clearly seen in the resurrection of Jesus, as <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a> states that Jesus was "declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead." The Spirit's work in Jesus' life, from His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>) to His resurrection, confirms His identity and mission.<p><b>was seen by angels,</b><br>Angels played a significant role in the life and ministry of Jesus. They announced His birth (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9-14</a>), ministered to Him after His temptation (<a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>), and were present at His resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2-7</a>). The presence of angels highlights the heavenly affirmation of Jesus' work and the cosmic significance of His mission. This phrase also suggests the spiritual realm's acknowledgment of Jesus' authority and victory.<p><b>was proclaimed among the nations,</b><br>This highlights the spread of the gospel beyond the Jewish community to the Gentiles, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The early church, empowered by the Holy Spirit, took the message of Jesus to various parts of the Roman Empire and beyond, as seen in the missionary journeys of Paul and others in the Book of Acts. This proclamation among the nations signifies the universal scope of salvation through Christ.<p><b>was believed in throughout the world,</b><br>The early church experienced rapid growth as people from diverse backgrounds came to faith in Jesus Christ. This global belief is a testament to the power of the gospel and the work of the Holy Spirit in drawing people to Christ. The phrase reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of God's salvation reaching the ends of the earth. It also underscores the transformative impact of the gospel message across different cultures and societies.<p><b>was taken up in glory.</b><br>This refers to the ascension of Jesus into heaven, as recorded in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>. The ascension marks the completion of Jesus' earthly ministry and His exaltation at the right hand of the Father (<a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>). It signifies His authority and ongoing intercessory work for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The ascension also anticipates His return, as the angels told the disciples that Jesus would come back in the same way they saw Him go into heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the one who "appeared in the flesh" and was "taken up in glory."

The only way anyone can live such a life is by embracing the revelation that follows in the six poetic lines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He appeared in the flesh</b><p>&#8226; God the Son stepped into time and space as Jesus of Nazareth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; His real humanity affirms that He experienced our limitations, temptations, and sufferings without sin (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14-18</a>; 4:15).<p>&#8226; The incarnation anchors our salvation: only a true, sinless human can be our substitute; only God can bear infinite wrath and grant eternal life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was vindicated by the Spirit</b><p>&#8226; At His baptism the Spirit descended on Him, and the Father&#8217;s voice declared, &#8220;This is My beloved Son&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout His ministry the Spirit empowered every miracle and teaching (<a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14, 18</a>).<p>&#8226; Most decisively, the Spirit vindicated Jesus by raising Him from the dead, proving His righteousness and divine identity (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; 8:11; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was seen by angels</b><p>&#8226; Angels announced His birth (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9-14</a>), strengthened Him in Gethsemane (<a href="/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>), and proclaimed His resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their ceaseless worship underscores His worthiness (<a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Angels witness both the glory and the humility of Christ, highlighting the cosmic scope of redemption (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was proclaimed among the nations</b><p>&#8226; From Pentecost onward, the apostles carried the good news of Jesus to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and &#8220;to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; 2:5-11).<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s promise that the Messiah would be &#8220;a light for the nations&#8221; finds fulfillment as the gospel crosses every cultural barrier (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46-48</a>).<p>&#8226; The mission remains active today, rooted in Christ&#8217;s command to &#8220;make disciples of all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was believed in throughout the world</b><p>&#8226; First-century churches sprang up across Asia Minor, Greece, Rome, and beyond (<a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith spreads because the Spirit opens hearts, just as He did for Lydia in Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The global church&#8212;every tribe, tongue, and people&#8212;testifies that the gospel is both true and powerful (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was taken up in glory</b><p>&#8226; After forty days of resurrection appearances, Jesus ascended bodily into heaven (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; He sits at the Father&#8217;s right hand, interceding for believers and reigning until every enemy is subdued (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; 10:12-13; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; His glorious ascension assures us that He will return in the same way, completing the redemption He began (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a> compresses the entire gospel into a single, Spirit-inspired confession.

Yes, confessedly great--so great that the massive grandeur of the pillar is only in proportion to the truth it supports.<p><span class= "bld">God was manifest in the flesh.</span>--Here, in the most ancient authorities, the word "God" does not occur. We must, then, literally translate the Greek of the most famous and trustworthy MSS. as follows: <span class= "ital">He who was manifested in the flesh.</span> In the later MSS., and in the great majority of the fathers who cite the passage, we certainly find <span class= "ital">Theos</span> ("God"), as in the Received text. The substitution can be traced to no special doctrinal prejudice, but is owing, probably, to a well-meant correction of early scribes. At first sight, <span class= "ital">Theos</span> ("God") would be a reading easier to understand, and grammatically more exact; and in the original copies, the great similitude between <span class= "greekheb">?C</span> ("God")--the contracted form in which <span class= "greekheb">?EOC</span> was written--and the relative <span class= "greekheb">?C</span> ("He who"), would be likely to suggest to an officious scribe the very trifling alteration necessary for the easier and apparently more accurate word. Recent investigations have shown, however, beyond controversy that the oldest MSS., with scarcely an exception, contain the more difficult reading, <span class= "greekheb">?C</span> ("He who"). The Greek pronoun thus rendered is simply a relative to an omitted but easily-inferred antecedent--viz., <span class= "ital">Christ.</span> Possibly the difficulty in the construction is due to the fact of the whole verse being a fragment of an ancient Christian hymn, embodying a confession of faith, well known to, and perhaps often sung by, the faithful among the congregations of such cities as Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome--a confession embodying the grand facts of the Incarnation and the Resurrection, the preaching of the cross to, and its reception by, the Gentile world, and the present session of Christ in glory. In the original Greek the rhythmical, as well as the antithetical character, of the clauses is very striking. In the English translation they can hardly be reproduced:--<p>"Who was manifested in the flesh,<p>justified in the Spirit,<p>seen of angels,<p>was preached among the Gentiles,<p>believed on in the world,<p>taken up into glory."<p>Fragments of similar hymns to Christ are found in <a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2Timothy 2:11</a>, and perhaps also in <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">He who</span> for <span class="accented">God</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">manifested</span> for <span class="accented">manifest</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">among the nations</span> for <span class="accented">unto the Gentiles</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Without controversy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but used in the same sense in the LXX. and in classical Greek, "confessedly," by common confession. <span class="cmt_word">Great is the mystery of godliness.</span> This is said to enhance the glory of the Church just spoken of, to whom this <span class="accented">mystery</span> has been entrusted, and so still further to impress upon Timothy the vital necessity of a wise and holy walk in the Church. <span class="accented">The mystery of godliness</span> is all that truth which "in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit." <span class="cmt_word">Godliness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e."</span> the Christian faith;" what in <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a> is called "The words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f76;&#x1fb3;</span>)," and in <a href="/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>, "The truth which is according to godliness."

It is always mysteries (or mystery) of the kingdom of God, of Christ, of God, of the gospel, and the like. In the following passages the objective sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is either necessary or by far the most natural: <a href="/acts/3-7.htm">Acts 3:7</a>; <a href="/acts/13-8.htm">Acts 13:8</a>; <a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="/acts/16-5.htm">Acts 16:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10, 21</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="/titus/1-13.htm">Titus 1:13</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>; <a href="/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>. Having thus exalted the "mystery of godliness," St. Paul goes on to expound it. <span class="cmt_word">He who</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>). This is generally adopted now as the true reading, instead of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3a3;</span>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3a3;</span>). Bishop Ellicott satisfied himself, by most careful personal examination, that the original reading of the Cod. Alex. was <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3a3;</span>, and that it had been altered by a later hand to <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3a3;</span>. The Cod. Sinait certainly has <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>, and to this all the older versions agree. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">quod</span>, agreeing with <span class="accented">sacramentum</span> and representing the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> Accepting this, then, as the true reading, we proceed to explain it. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c2;</span>, who, is a relative, and must, therefore, have an antecedent. But there is no expressed antecedent of the masculine gender for it to agree with. The antecedent, therefore, must be understood, and gathered from the preceding words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. It can only be Christ. The mystery of the whole Old Testament, that which was wrapped in types and hidden under veils, was Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). Moses spake of him, the Psalms speak of him, the prophets speak of him; but all of them spake darkly. But in the gospel "the mystery of Christ" (<a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>)is revealed. Christ is the Mystery of Christianity. It is, therefore, no difficult step to pass from "the mystery" to "Christ," and to supply the word "Christ" as the antecedent to "who." <span class="cmt_word">Was manifested</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); a word frequently applied to Christ (<a href="/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5, 8</a>, etc.). The idea is the same in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Justified in the spirit.</span> This is rather an obscure expression. But it seems to describe our Lord's spotless righteousness, perhaps with special reference to the declaration of it at his baptism, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." We have the same contrast between the flesh and the Spirit of Christ in <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>. And between the flesh and the spirit of a Christian man in <a href="/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>, "The body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness." To this clause apparently the remark of Chrysostom applies, "God became man, and man became God." "The spirit" seems to mean the moral nature - the inner man. <span class="cmt_word">Seen of angels.</span> Perhaps the multitude of the heavenly host who welcomed the birth of Christ were permitted to see the new-born Babe, as he seems to have done who described him to the shepherds as "wrapped in swaddling clothes" (<a href="/luke/2-12.htm">Luke 2:12-14</a>). Angels ministered unto him after the temptation (<a href="/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>), and in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>, where the word <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is used), and at his resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>). The special interest of angels in the "<span class="accented">great mystery"</span> is referred to in <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Preached among the nations</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). It would have been better to keep the rendering "Gentiles" here, to mark the identity of thought with <a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6, 8</a>, where, in the apostle's view, the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, that they might be fellow-heirs with the Jews of the promises of God, is one main feature of the mystery (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Believed on in the world.</span> The next step in this ascending scale is the acceptance of Christ in the world as the Savior thereof. The language here is not stronger than that of <a href="/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 6</a>, "The word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world, and beareth fruit." And in <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>, "The gospel which was preached in all creation under heaven" (comp. <a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). The statement in <a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15-20</a> might almost have been in St. Paul's mind. Note the use there of the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Received up in glory.</span> The change of "into" (A.V.) into "in" is of very doubtful propriety. In New Testament Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, frequently follows verbs of motion, and means the same as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, like the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>. Our Lord is net said to have ascended <span class="accented">in glory</span> (as he appeared at the Transfiguration), but, as St. Mark has it, "He was received up into heaven, and [there] sat down at the right hand of God," fulfilling <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>. This grand burst of dogmatic teaching is somewhat like that in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5-7</a>. There is no adequate evidence of its being, as many commentators have thought, a portion of a hymn or creed used in the Church. It rather implies the same tension in the apostle's mind which is apparent in other parts of the Epistle (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a> and following verses). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By common confession,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(homologoumen&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3672.htm">Strong's 3672: </a> </span><span class="str2">Admittedly, without controversy.
