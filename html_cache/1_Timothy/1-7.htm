In the Jewish tradition, teachers of the law, or rabbis, held significant authority and respect. The law refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament, which were central to Jewish life and worship. In the early church, there was a transition from the old covenant to the new covenant in Christ, and some individuals sought to impose Jewish legalism on Gentile converts. This desire to teach the law without proper understanding reflects a common issue in the early church, where false teachings and misunderstandings about the role of the law in the life of a believer were prevalent. This is addressed in other New Testament writings, such as Galatians, where Paul emphasizes that salvation is through faith in Christ, not adherence to the law.<p><b>but they do not understand what they are saying</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the lack of true comprehension among these would-be teachers. They may have been familiar with the words and rituals of the law, but they lacked a deep, spiritual understanding of its purpose and fulfillment in Christ. This echoes Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees, who were often criticized for their superficial adherence to the law without grasping its deeper meaning (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23-24</a>). The law was intended to point to Christ and reveal humanity's need for a Savior, a concept these teachers failed to grasp. Their misunderstanding could lead to confusion and division within the church, as they might propagate teachings that were inconsistent with the gospel message.<p><b>or that which they so confidently assert</b><br>This phrase indicates the boldness and assurance with which these individuals proclaimed their teachings, despite their lack of understanding. Confidence without knowledge can be dangerous, especially in spiritual matters. The early church faced many challenges from false teachers who confidently spread incorrect doctrines, leading believers astray. This is why Paul emphasizes the importance of sound doctrine and proper teaching throughout his letters (e.g., <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>). The confidence of these teachers was misplaced, as it was not rooted in the truth of the gospel. This serves as a warning to ensure that one's confidence in teaching is based on a correct understanding of Scripture and the leading of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and doctrine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, stationed in Ephesus to oversee the church and combat false teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its diverse culture and religious practices, including the worship of Artemis.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals in the Ephesian church who desired to be teachers of the law but lacked true understanding and knowledge.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which some in the early church were misapplying or misunderstanding in the context of Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_teaching.htm">The Responsibility of Teaching</a></b><br>Teaching God's Word is a serious responsibility that requires understanding and discernment.
