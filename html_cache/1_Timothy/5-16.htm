The term "believing woman" indicates a Christian woman who is part of the faith community. The mention of "dependent widows" reflects the cultural context where widows often lacked financial support and were vulnerable. The Bible frequently emphasizes the care of widows (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>), highlighting their need for protection and provision. This phrase underscores the responsibility of family members to care for their own, aligning with the broader biblical principle of honoring one's family (<a href="/1_timothy/5-4.htm">1 Timothy 5:4</a>).<p><b>she must assist them</b><br>The directive for the believing woman to assist her dependent widows emphasizes personal responsibility within the family unit. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and care for one's relatives (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>). The early church functioned as a community where believers were expected to support one another, especially those within their own households. This assistance could include financial support, providing food, or offering shelter, aligning with the teachings of Jesus on loving and serving others (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>).<p><b>and not allow the church to be burdened</b><br>The instruction not to burden the church highlights the importance of prioritizing church resources for those who have no other means of support. In the early Christian communities, resources were often limited, and the church was responsible for caring for the truly destitute. This principle ensures that the church can fulfill its mission effectively, without being overwhelmed by responsibilities that should be managed by individual families. It reflects the early church's practice of communal support, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>, where believers shared their possessions to meet each other's needs.<p><b>so that it can help the widows who are truly in need</b><br>This phrase distinguishes between widows who have family support and those who do not, ensuring that the church's aid is directed to those most in need. The early church had a structured approach to caring for widows, as seen in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>, where deacons were appointed to oversee the distribution of resources. This reflects the biblical theme of justice and mercy, ensuring that the vulnerable are cared for (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). The church's role in supporting widows is a reflection of God's compassion and care for the marginalized, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance on church leadership and community responsibilities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young church leader and prot&#233;g&#233;

By providing for their own, believers prevent avoidable pressure on church resources, allowing the congregation to concentrate on widows with no other means. In this way, individual obedience and corporate compassion work together to honor God, care for the vulnerable, and keep the witness of the church strong.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them.</span>--This is not what, at first sight, it appears to be--a mere repetition of the injunction of <a href="/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1Timothy 5:4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1Timothy 5:8</a>. <span class= "ital">There</span> the duties enjoined were what may be termed filial; the love, respect, and kindness to the aged was especially pressed on the younger, on the children and grandchildren of the desolate, on the master of the house or family to which the aged widow belonged. Here the reference belongs exclusively to the younger widows, who (see Note above) were, no doubt, very numerous in a great Asian Church like Ephesus; for the future of these women, often still young and totally unprovided for, St. Paul was very anxious. Until a new home was found for such, of course the Church cared for them, but this heavy burden on the Church's alms must be lightened as much as possible. It was the plain duty of relatives to care for these in their hour of destitution and sorrow. The Church would have many a one, still comparatively speaking young, utterly dependent on its scanty funds--friendless as well as homeless.<p>It has been asked: How is it that, considering the prominence here given to the questions (<span class= "ital">a</span>) of the support of Christian widows, (<span class= "ital">b</span>) of the rules respecting presbyteral widows, who evidently occupied a position of dignity and importance in the Church of the first days, no other mention of this class in the community (with the exception of <a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>; <a href="/acts/9-39.htm" title="Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.">Acts 9:39</a>) appears in the whole New Testament.<p>This has been pressed as one of the arguments pointing to a much later date for the writing of the Epistle; but the question is, after all, readily and conclusively answered. With the exception of the short Epistle to Titus, the subject of the <span class= "ital">internal</span> organisation of a church is nowhere handled. There is no room or place for such a mention in any of the more exclusively doctrinal or apologetic Epistles. In the broad field of ecclesiastical history occupied by the Acts, the two casual allusions above referred to, in the Churches of Jerusalem and Lydda, tell us of the existence of and the care for these widows in the communities of Christians, even in the earliest years of the Church's existence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">Woman</span> for <span class="accented">man or woman</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">hath</span> for <span class="accented">have</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">her</span> for <span class="accented">them</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">burdened</span> for <span class="accented">charged</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>If any woman</span>, etc. So the preponderance of the best manuscripts, and the texts of Lachmann, Buttmann, Tischendorf, etc. But the T.R. is retained by Alford, Ellicott, 'Speaker's Commentary,' and others. If the R.V. is right, the woman only is mentioned as being the person who has the management of the house. The precept here seems to be an extension of that in ver. 4, which relates only to children and grandchildren, and to be given, moreover, with special reference to Christian widows who had no believing relations to care for them, and so were necessarily cast upon the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Let her relieve them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, as in vet 10). <span class="cmt_word">Widows indeed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, as in vers. 2 and 5). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/5-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7988;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
