The "things" refer to the warnings against false teachings and encouragements to godly living mentioned earlier in the chapter. This reflects the role of a leader in the early church, emphasizing the importance of sound doctrine. The term "brothers" indicates the familial nature of the Christian community, highlighting unity and mutual care.<p><b>you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus</b><br>Being a "good servant" implies dedication and faithfulness in ministry. The term "servant" (Greek: diakonos) suggests humility and a willingness to serve others, following the example of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). This phrase underscores the call to live a life that reflects Christ's teachings and character.<p><b>nourished by the words of faith</b><br>"Nourished" suggests a continuous process of growth and sustenance, akin to how physical food sustains the body. The "words of faith" refer to the core teachings of Christianity, including the gospel message and apostolic doctrine. This highlights the necessity of spiritual nourishment through Scripture and sound teaching, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>, where Jesus emphasizes living by every word from God.<p><b>and sound instruction</b><br>"Sound instruction" implies teaching that is healthy, correct, and beneficial for spiritual growth. This contrasts with the false teachings Paul warns against. The emphasis on sound doctrine is a recurring theme in the Pastoral Epistles, as seen in <a href="/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9</a>, where leaders are urged to hold firmly to trustworthy messages.<p><b>that you have followed</b><br>Timothy's adherence to sound teaching is commended, indicating his faithfulness and reliability. This phrase suggests a pattern of life and ministry that aligns with apostolic teaching. It also serves as an encouragement for believers to remain steadfast in their faith, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14</a>, where Paul urges Timothy to continue in what he has learned.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and personal conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, entrusted with the leadership of the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was stationed, known for its diverse culture and challenges to early Christian teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_jesus.htm">Christ Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the Christian faith, whom Timothy serves as a minister.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brothers.htm">The Brothers</a></b><br>Refers to the members of the Christian community or church that Timothy is leading and teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/n/nourishment_from_faith_and_instruction.htm">Nourishment from Faith and Instruction</a></b><br>Just as physical nourishment is essential for the body, spiritual nourishment from faith and sound teaching is vital for the soul.

Not a few, probably, in that Ephesian flock had been won over by the persuasive words of the false teachers to attribute a peculiar virtue to such practices--practices which, if persevered in, St. Paul well knew would tend to set up for imitation in the Church an unreal, unhealthy standard of life.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ.</span>--A high title to honour, this, "a good minister of Jesus Christ," and one Timothy would well earn if he would set himself in all earnestness to oppose and discredit the sickly teaching of the Ascetic school.<p>He would by such opposition, indeed, earn the "title to honour," for St. Paul well knew how great was the danger of a comparatively young and ardent disciple like Timothy being attracted by such mistaken teachings of perfection. But "the good minister of Jesus Christ" must teach "a life" which may be led by all, not by a select few merely, of the believers on his Master. Asceticism is too often a winning and attractive school of teaching to ministers, as, at a comparatively easy price, they win a great, but at the same time thoroughly unhealthy, power over the souls of men and women who practise these austerities, which tend necessarily to remove them out of the stream of active life.<p><span class= "bld">Nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine.</span>--The Greek present participle rendered here "nourished up in," marks a continuous and permanent process of self-education. It might be translated "ever training thyself"--a wise and never-to-be-forgotten precept of St. Paul's, this reminder to his own dear son in the faith, Timothy--and through Timothy to all Christian ministers of every age--never to relax their efforts for self-improvement. The education of the good minister of Jesus Christ is never to be considered finished. He--the teacher of others--must ever be striving himself after a higher and a yet higher knowledge in things spiritual.<p><span class= "bld">Whereunto thou hast attained.</span>--More accurately translated, <span class= "ital">which thou hast closely followed.</span> In the teaching respecting faith and practice which Timothy, as a disciple, has diligently followed out step by step--in that teaching he is to study to advance yet farther, so as to gain deeper and ever deeper knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">Mind</span> for <span class="accented">remembrance</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">nourished</span> for <span class="accented">nourished up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the faith</span> for <span class="accented">faith</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the good</span> for <span class="accented">good</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which thou hast followed until now</span> for <span class="accented">whereunto thou hast attained</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">If thou put the brethren in mind of these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); if thou <span class="accented">suggest</span> these things to the brethren, <span class="accented">lay them down as principles</span> upon which their conduct is to be based; or, <span class="accented">enjoin</span> them (Liddell and Scott).
