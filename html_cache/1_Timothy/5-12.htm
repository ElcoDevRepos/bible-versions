In the context of <a href="/1_timothy/5.htm">1 Timothy 5</a>, Paul addresses the behavior of younger widows who may become idle and turn away from their commitments. The concept of incurring judgment is consistent with biblical teachings on accountability, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>, where each person must give an account of themselves to God. The idea of judgment here is not necessarily eternal condemnation but a divine assessment of one's actions and faithfulness.<p><b>because they are setting aside</b><br>This phrase implies a deliberate action of abandoning or neglecting a previous commitment. In the cultural context of the early church, vows and commitments were taken seriously, and breaking them was seen as a significant moral failure. The act of setting aside one's faith or vows could lead to spiritual and communal consequences, reflecting the importance of steadfastness in one's spiritual journey, as emphasized in <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>, which encourages believers to hold unswervingly to the hope they profess.<p><b>their first faith</b><br>The "first faith" likely refers to the initial commitment or vow made by these women, possibly at the time of their conversion or when they dedicated themselves to a life of service. This concept is echoed in <a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4</a>, where the church in Ephesus is admonished for abandoning its first love. The idea of a "first faith" underscores the importance of maintaining one's initial zeal and dedication to God. In a broader biblical context, it serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, akin to the faithfulness expected in marriage, as seen in the prophetic imagery of Hosea.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance on church leadership and conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, stationed in Ephesus, tasked with overseeing the church and ensuring sound doctrine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/widows.htm">Widows</a></b><br>Specifically, younger widows are addressed in this passage, as Paul advises on their conduct and the church's support.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its diverse population and challenges to early Christian teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_church.htm">Early Church</a></b><br>The context in which these instructions were given, dealing with issues of community support and personal conduct.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_commitment.htm">The Importance of Commitment</a></b><br>The phrase "set aside their first faith" underscores the importance of maintaining one's initial commitment to Christ.

The Greek word <span class= "ital">krima</span> is often thus unhappily translated. The context of the passage must in all cases decide the nature of the "judgment," whether favourable or the contrary. Here it signifies that those who in after days give up a work which for their Master's sake they had undertaken, expose themselves to a searching judgment, which will thoroughly sift the reasons that induced them to forsake the begun toil, and that, if the reasons be not satisfactory, will be unfavourable, and will surely involve condemnation.<p><span class= "bld">Because they have cast off their first faith.</span>--Though, probably, no vows respecting marriage were required from those widows who devoted themselves to the Lord's service, yet virtually such a solemn enrolment partook of the nature of a life-long engagement--an engagement which, if they married again, must necessarily be given up.<p>Such a going back, such a giving up the higher and the more devoted life--the life of self-sacrifice, of self-abnegation--for the ordinary joys and cares of domestic life, for the useful but still every-day pursuits of ordinary men and women--such a going back, would be indeed a casting off their first faith, and such an example of backsliding could not fail to harm the cause of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">Condemnation</span> for <span class="accented">dare</span>, <span class="accented">ration</span>, A.V,; <span class="accented">rejected</span> for <span class="accented">cast off</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Condemnation</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, variously translated in the A.V.
