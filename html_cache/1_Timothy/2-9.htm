In the cultural context of the early church, clothing was a significant indicator of social status and moral character. Respectable apparel would have been understood as clothing that is appropriate for worship and does not draw undue attention. This aligns with the biblical principle of humility and the call to live a life that honors God (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<p><b>with modesty</b><br>Modesty in this context refers to an attitude of humility and decency. It is not merely about clothing but also about the demeanor and intentions behind one's appearance. Modesty is a recurring theme in Scripture, encouraging believers to focus on inner beauty and godliness rather than outward adornment (<a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>).<p><b>and with self-control</b><br>Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and is essential for living a life that pleases God. It involves discipline in all areas, including how one dresses and presents oneself. This virtue helps believers resist societal pressures to conform to worldly standards and instead live according to God's will.<p><b>not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes</b><br>In the Greco-Roman world, elaborate hairstyles and expensive jewelry were often associated with wealth and social status. By advising against these, the text encourages women to focus on spiritual adornment rather than external appearances. This echoes the teaching in <a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>, which contrasts external beauty with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit.

"Likewise," he goes on to say, "I desire that women, when they pray"--women also in the congregation had their duties as well as the men--while the latter were directed to conduct and lead the public prayer, the women who worshipped with them were enjoined, as their part of the solemn service, to be present, adorned with neatness of apparel and modesty of demeanour, and the holy reputation of kind deeds.<p><span class= "bld">Adorn themselves in modest apparel.</span>--This direction to Christian women was not intended to apply to their ordinary dress in the world, but simply explained to the sisters of the Ephesian flock that their place in public worship was one of quiet attention--that their reverence and adoration must be shown not by thrusting themselves forward with a view to public teaching or public praying, but by being present and taking part silently--avoiding especially in these services anything like a conspicuous dress or showy ornaments--anything, in fact, which would be likely to arouse attention, or distract the thoughts of others.<p><span class= "bld">With shamefacedness and sobriety.</span>--These expressions denote the inward feelings with which the Apostle desires the devout Christian women to come to divine service; the first signifies "the innate shrinking from anything unbecoming." The second, sobriety, includes the idea of self-restraint--the conquest over all wanton thought and desire.<p><span class= "bld">Not with broided hair.</span>--Comp. <a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm" title="Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;">1Peter 3:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.">Isaiah 3:24</a>. "Broided:" the modern form is "braided." Some modern editions give "broidered," apparently by mistake.<p><span class= "bld">Or gold.</span>--Probably, the "gold" is supposed to be twined among the plaits of the hair. These elaborate adornments, so likely to catch the eye at divine worship, were quite inconsistent with Christian simplicity, besides being calculated to distract the attention of their fellow worshippers, male as well as female. On this question of seemly, quiet apparel, in an assembly gathered for divine worship, see the difficult verse, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1Corinthians 11:10</a>, where <span class= "ital">another</span> and a still graver reason for modest demeanour and apparel of women is alleged--"because of the angels."<p><span class= "bld">Pearls, or costly array.</span>--Ear-rings, necklaces, bracelets, are included here; these costly ornaments were worn by the ladies of the luxurious age in which St. Paul lived, in great profusion. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">In like manner</span> for <span class="accented">in like manner also</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">braided</span> for <span class="accented">broided</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and gold</span> for or <span class="accented">gold</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">raiment</span> for <span class="accented">array</span>, A.V.

Alford argues strongly in favor of the meaning "apparel." But it may also mean "steadiness" or "quietness" of demeanor; and then the phrase will be exactly parallel to <a href="/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5</a>, "The incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit." And the meaning will be, "Let Christian women adorn themselves with a decent and well-ordered quietness of demeanor, in strict accordance with [or, 'together with'] shame-fastness and sobriety [<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, 'in strict accord with,' or 'together with'] not with braided hair," etc. A woman's true ornament is not the finery which sire gets from the milliner, but the chaste discretion which she has from the Spirit of God. <span class="cmt_word">Modest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only found in the New Testament here and in <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, where it is rendered" of good behavior" in the A.V., and "modest" in the margin, "orderly" in the R.V.

So the edition of 1611; "shamefacedness" in the later editions is a corruption.
