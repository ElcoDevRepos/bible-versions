The term "believing masters" indicates that some slave owners were also Christians. This phrase highlights the unique dynamic within the Christian community where both slaves and masters could be part of the same faith. The New Testament does not explicitly call for the abolition of slavery but rather addresses the conduct of believers within the existing social structures (<a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-9</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-4</a>:1).<p><b>should not show disrespect because they are brothers</b><br>The concept of spiritual equality among believers is emphasized here. <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> states that in Christ, there is neither slave nor free, indicating a spiritual brotherhood that transcends social status. However, this spiritual equality does not negate the social roles and responsibilities. Slaves are encouraged to respect their masters, recognizing their shared faith and brotherhood in Christ.<p><b>but should serve them all the more</b><br>This phrase calls for a higher standard of service from Christian slaves to their Christian masters. The motivation for this service is not merely duty but love and respect for fellow believers. This reflects the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>, where going the extra mile is encouraged as a demonstration of love and commitment.<p><b>since those receiving their good service are beloved believers</b><br>The term "beloved believers" underscores the affection and value placed on fellow Christians. The service rendered is not just a duty but an act of love towards those who are cherished in the faith community. This aligns with the broader New Testament teaching on love and service within the body of Christ (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<p><b>Teach and encourage these principles</b><br>Paul instructs Timothy to actively teach and promote these values within the church. This reflects the pastoral responsibility to guide the congregation in living out their faith in practical ways. The emphasis on teaching and encouragement is consistent with Paul's other letters, where sound doctrine and godly living are central themes (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>, <a href="/titus/2.htm">Titus 2:1-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of the Apostle Paul, to whom this letter is addressed.

In the first-century Roman world, many believers were bound in servitude, yet Scripture never excuses mistreatment (<a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>) and consistently dignifies the servant (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21-22</a>). By addressing them directly, the apostle affirms their worth and responsibility before God, echoing passages like <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a> where servants are likewise called to honor Christ in their station.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>should not show disrespect because they are brothers</b><p>Being &#8220;brothers&#8221; in Christ removes spiritual barriers (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), but it does not erase God-ordained lines of authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Familiarity could tempt a servant to treat a believing master casually or even presume upon the relationship. Paul counters that impulse, urging the same respectful submission described in <a href="/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21</a> and <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>. Honor is still owed, even within the family of faith (<a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but should serve them all the more</b><p>Rather than doing the minimum, Christian servants are to excel. &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). Going &#8220;all the more&#8221; reflects Jesus&#8217; call to go the second mile (<a href="/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>) and echoes the humility of <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>. Their diligent service becomes an act of worship, showing that devotion to Christ heightens, not lessens, earthly responsibilities (<a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since those receiving their good service are beloved believers</b><p>The masters are &#8220;beloved&#8221;&#8212;loved by God and by their servants. Working faithfully blesses fellow believers and strengthens the household of faith (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>). Jesus said, &#8220;By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>). Practical service makes that love visible (<a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>) and promotes harmony instead of rivalry (<a href="/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Teach and encourage these principles</b><p>Timothy must faithfully relay this instruction to the congregation.

When leaders &#8220;exhort and rebuke with all authority&#8221; (<a href="/titus/2-15.htm">Titus 2:15</a>), believers learn to relate rightly in every social setting. The church today continues that duty, coaching employees and employers to honor Christ in the workplace (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a> calls servants with Christian masters to heightened respect and excellent service, motivated by shared brotherhood and love. Far from relaxing duty, family bonds in Christ intensify commitment. Paul charges leaders to keep teaching this balance of equality in Christ and order in daily life so that every relationship, including the workplace, showcases the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren.</span>--This being in servitude to Christian masters, of course, in the days of St. Paul would happen less frequently. Let those Christian slaves who have the good fortune to serve "believing masters" allow no such thoughts as, "Shall I remain my brother's slave?" take root in the breast and poison the life-work. Let them not presume on the common brotherhood of men in Christ, on their being fellow-heirs of heaven, and on this account deem their earthly masters their equals, and so refuse them the customary respect and attention. Let them remember that, though <span class= "ital">in heaven</span> there would be no respect of persons, <span class= "ital">on earth</span> the old class differences were not removed.<p><span class= "bld">But rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit.</span>--The Greek here is better translated thus: <span class= "ital">but the rather serve them, because believing and beloved are they who are partakers of their good service.</span> Let these slaves of Christians rather (or, <span class= "ital">the more</span>) serve their masters zealously and loyally, because the masters who will profit by their true faithful service are themselves believers in Jesus, the beloved of God. This thought should never be absent from the heart of a Christian slave to a Christian master. "Every good piece of work I do will be a kindness shown to one who loves my Lord."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Let them serve them the rather</span> for <span class="accented">rather do them service</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved</span> for <span class="accented">are faithful and beloved</span>, <span class="accented">partakers of the benefit</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They that have believing masters.</span> The direction in the preceding verse applied to all slaves, though chiefly to what, as Alford says, was far the commonest ease, that of those who had unbelieving masters. But now he adds a caution with regard to the Christian slave of a Christian master. There was a danger lest the feeling that slaves and masters are brothers in Christ should unduly interfere with the respect which he owed him as his master. And so St. Paul addresses a word of special advice to such. <span class="cmt_word">Let them not despise them.</span> Let not their spiritual equality with their masters lead them to underrate the worldly difference that separates them; or to think slightly of the authority of a master relatively to his slaves (comp. <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved.</span> There is a good deal of obscurity in this sentence, but it may be observed first that the grammatical rendering of the R.V. is clearly right, and that of the A.V. clearly wrong. "They that partake of the benefit" is beyond all doubt the subject, and not the predicate. Then the construction of the two sentences (this and the preceding one) makes it certain that the subject in this sentence (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are the same persons as the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the preceding sentence, because it is predicated of them both that they are <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, and of both that they are, in convertible terms, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. And this leads us, with nearly certainty, to the further conclusion that the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the <span class="accented">beneficium</span>, or "benefit," spoken of is that especial <span class="accented">service</span> - that service of love and good will running ahead of necessary duty, which the Christian slave gives to the Christian master; a sense which the very remarkable passage quoted by Alford from Seneca strikingly confirms. The only remaining difficulty, then, is the meaning "partake of" ascribed to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> But this is scarcely a difficulty. It is true that in the only two other passages in the New Testament where this verb occurs, and in its frequent use in the LXX., it has the sense of "helping" (<a href="/luke/1-54.htm">Luke 1:54</a>; <a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>); but there is nothing strange in this. The verb in the middle voice means to "lay hold of," You may <span class="accented">lay hold of</span> for the purpose of helping, supporting, clinging to, laying claim to, holding in check, etc. (see Liddell and Scott). Here the masters <span class="accented">lay hold</span> of the benefit for the purpose of enjoying it. There is possibly an indication in the word that the masters actively and willingly accept it - they stretch out their hand to take it. There does not seem to be any sense of reciprocity, as some think, in the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. The sense of the whole passage seems to be clearly, "Let not those who have believing masters think slightly of their authority because they are brethren; but let them do them extra service, beyond what they are obliged to do, for the very reason that those whom they will thus benefit are believing and beloved brethren." <span class="cmt_word">Teach</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>).
