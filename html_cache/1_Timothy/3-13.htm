This phrase emphasizes the importance of fulfilling this role with diligence and integrity. The Greek word for deacon, "diakonos," means servant or minister, highlighting the servant leadership model exemplified by Jesus Christ (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). The early church in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a> provides a context where deacons were appointed to ensure fair distribution of resources, allowing the apostles to focus on prayer and ministry of the word.<p><b>acquire for themselves a high standing</b><br>Serving well as a deacon leads to a respected position within the church community. This "high standing" is not about worldly status but about spiritual influence and moral authority. It reflects the biblical principle that humility and faithful service lead to exaltation by God (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). The respect gained is both from God and the church body, as seen in the commendation of faithful servants in <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>.<p><b>and great confidence</b><br>This confidence is a deep assurance and boldness in one's faith and service. It is the result of a clear conscience and a life lived in accordance with God's will. <a href="/hebrews/10-35.htm">Hebrews 10:35-36</a> speaks to the importance of maintaining confidence in the faith, which leads to receiving God's promises. This confidence is not self-derived but is rooted in the assurance of God's approval and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>in the faith that is in Christ Jesus</b><br>The faith mentioned here is specifically centered on Jesus Christ, the foundation of Christian belief. This phrase underscores the centrality of Christ in the life and service of a deacon. It is a reminder that all Christian service is ultimately about pointing others to Christ and building His kingdom. The faith in Christ is both the source and the goal of a deacon's service, as seen in passages like <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>, which calls believers to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance on church leadership and conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, stationed in Ephesus, tasked with organizing the church and ensuring sound doctrine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/deacons.htm">Deacons</a></b><br>Church leaders responsible for serving the congregation, distinct from elders, with a focus on practical service and administration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its diverse population and challenges in maintaining Christian doctrine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_jesus.htm">Christ Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the Christian faith, in whom believers find their confidence and standing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_service.htm">The Value of Service</a></b><br>Serving well as a deacon is highly esteemed in the church and before God.

The old translation perhaps is best. Alford writes strikingly on the change of tense: "They that <span class= "ital">have</span> used <span class= "ital">are</span> acquiring or purchasing." The Apostle having begun by placing himself at the great day of retribution, now shifts the scene and deals with their present conduct. "Those who shall then be found to have served well, &c. . . . are now, &c."<p>The "good degree" they are now purchasing by earnest, patient work may refer to advancement to the higher ministries of the Church, but, more probably, has reference to their future position in the blessed life to come. This is one of the passages not unfrequent in St. Paul's Epistles, where degrees of glory among the redeemed are clearly spoken of. The plain words of St. Paul and his Master teach the people of God that although the great act of redemption alone belongs to Christ, that through His merits only men obtain salvation, still His own, will in a great measure determine, by their works and days on earth, the position they will occupy in His kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">And great boldness.</span>--The true and faithful deacons not only will in the life to come win the great reward, but <span class= "ital">here</span> the result of their loyal, earnest service would be, that before <span class= "ital">men</span> they would do their work with serene, fearless confidence, and would at the same time be encouraged to approach that <span class= "ital">heavenly Father</span> at all times with the loving trustfulness of children.<p><span class= "bld">In the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span>--Faith was the foundation of the "great boldness," and <span class= "ital">the faith</span> rested on Jesus Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">Served well as deacons</span> for <span class="accented">used the office of a deacon well</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">gain to themselves a good standing</span> for <span class="accented">purchase to themselves a good degree</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Served... as deacons</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); as in ver. 10.

In <a href="/2_kings/20-9.htm">2 Kings 20:9, 10, 11</a>, it is the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "a degree on the sun-dial."

It does not follow that St. Paul had in his mind their advancement from the "<span class="accented">inferior</span> office" to "<span class="accented">the</span> higher ministries in the Church" (Ordination Service); he may merely have meant to say that the discharge of the duties of a deacon in an efficient and exemplary manner raised a man to high estimation in the Church, and so gave him confidence in confessing the faith of Jesus Christ both by word and deed. <span class="accented">Gain to themselves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); acquire by purchase or otherwise.

This seems to imply that St. Paul contemplated <span class="accented">preaching</span> as a part of the deacon's work. We know that Philip the deacon and Stephen the deacon were both preachers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/3-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
