This suggests a willful turning away from truth and righteousness, leading to moral decay.<p><b>who are devoid of the truth</b><br>Being devoid of the truth implies a complete lack of understanding or acceptance of the gospel. In <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, Jesus declares Himself as the truth, indicating that these individuals are separated from Christ. This absence of truth leads to false teachings and misguidance within the church.<p><b>These men regard godliness as a means of gain.</b><br>This phrase points to the motivation behind the actions of these individuals. They see godliness not as a path to spiritual growth or relationship with God, but as a way to achieve personal gain, whether financial or social.

St. Paul, here adding his command to Timothy to have no dealings with these men, dismisses the subject with these few scathing words of scorn and contempt. One can imagine with what feelings of holy anger one like the noble chivalrous St. Paul would regard the conduct of men who looked upon the profession of the religion of the Crucified as a source of gain. This was by far the gravest of his public charges against these teachers of a strange and novel Christianity. We read elsewhere (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/3-12.htm" title="Now if any man build on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;">1Corinthians 3:12-15</a>) men might go wrong in doctrine, might even teach an unpractical, useless religion, if only they were trying their poor best to build on the one foundation--Christ. Their faulty work would perish, but they would assuredly find mercy if only they were in earnest, if only they were zeal. But <span class= "ital">these, </span>St. Paul tells Timothy and his church, were not in <span class= "ital">earnest;</span> these were <span class= "ital">unreal.</span> Their religion--they traded upon it.

There was another school of teaching--he had just been dwelling on it--<span class= "ital">the</span> teaching which told men, even slaves, simply, lovingly to do their duty as though ever in the presence of the Lord, without any restless longing for change.

The addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> gives the sense of a "perverse discussion," or "<span class="accented">disputing</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Bereft</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). The difference between the A.V. "destitute" and the R.V. "<span class="accented">bereft"</span> is that the latter implies that they once had possession of the truth, but had lost it by their own fault. They had fallen away from the truth, and were twice dead. <span class="cmt_word">Godliness is a way of gain.</span> The A.V., <span class="accented">that gain is godliness</span>, is clearly wrong, utterly confusing the subject with the predicate, and so destroying the connection between the clause and ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">A way of gain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and in ver. 6 in the New Testament. but found in Wisd. 13:19 Wisd. 14:2; Polybius, etc. It signifies "a source of gain," "<span class="accented">a</span> means of malting money," or, in one word, "a trade." The same charge is brought against the heretical teachers (<a href="/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>). The cause in the A.V. and T.R., <span class="accented">from such withdraw thyself</span>, is not in the R.T. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[and] constant friction</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(diaparatribai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3859.htm">Strong's 3859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Useless debate.
