In the early church, spiritual gifts were seen as divine enablements for ministry and service. The Apostle Paul is urging Timothy to be diligent and proactive in using his God-given abilities. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching found in passages like <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-8</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>, which discuss the diversity and purpose of spiritual gifts within the body of Christ. The exhortation to not neglect these gifts suggests a personal responsibility to cultivate and develop them for the edification of the church.<p><b>which was given you through the prophecy</b><br>In the New Testament context, prophecy often involved a direct revelation from God, sometimes concerning future events or specific guidance. The mention of prophecy here indicates that Timothy's gift was recognized and affirmed through a prophetic message. This reflects the practice in the early church where leaders and members would receive prophetic words that confirmed God's calling and gifting, as seen in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a> with the commissioning of Paul and Barnabas. Prophecy served as a means of divine confirmation and encouragement for individuals in their ministry roles.<p><b>spoken over you at the laying on of the hands</b><br>The laying on of hands is a significant biblical practice symbolizing the impartation of blessing, authority, or the Holy Spirit. In the context of Timothy's ministry, it likely refers to his ordination or commissioning for service. This practice is rooted in both Old and New Testament traditions, such as the commissioning of Joshua by Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a> and the appointment of deacons in <a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>. It signifies a formal recognition and empowerment for ministry, often accompanied by prayer and prophetic words.<p><b>of the elders</b><br>The elders in the early church were leaders responsible for teaching, shepherding, and overseeing the congregation. Their involvement in the laying on of hands underscores the communal and authoritative aspect of Timothy's commissioning. Elders were typically mature believers with a deep understanding of the faith, as outlined in <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-7</a> and <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5-9</a>.

Timothy already possesses a God-given spiritual gift, and the apostle tells him, &#8220;Do not neglect it.&#8221; Comparable reminders appear when Paul later writes, &#8220;For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>). The implication is straightforward:<p>&#8226;Spiritual gifts can be underused or ignored. Paul uses &#8220;neglect&#8221; to describe passive drift, not outright rebellion (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226;Gifts are entrusted for the good of others: &#8220;To each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226;Diligence is the antidote. Peter echoes this: &#8220;Each of you should use whatever gift he has received to serve others&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226;Because gifts differ&#8212;prophecy, teaching, mercy, leadership, etc. (<a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-8</a>)&#8212;Timothy must discover, cultivate, and deploy his particular endowment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which was given you through the prophecy spoken over you</b><p>Timothy&#8217;s gift came &#8220;through the prophecy,&#8221; meaning God used prophetic utterance to identify and confirm it. Scripture gives a similar scene: &#8220;In keeping with the prophecies once made about you, fight the good fight&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>). What this tells us:<p>&#8226;Prophecy in the New Testament often affirms God&#8217;s call. <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a> describes prophets in Antioch declaring Barnabas and Saul&#8217;s missionary assignment.<p>&#8226;Prophetic words do not create gifts but spotlight what the Spirit is already granting; they provide clarity and courage.<p>&#8226;Genuine prophecy aligns with Scripture, is recognized by church leadership, and produces fruit, never confusion (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the laying on of the hands of the elders</b><p>The means God used was the public act of ordination: elders laying hands on Timothy. This pattern stretches across the New Testament:<p>&#8226;Commissioning servants: &#8220;They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them&#8221; (<a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226;Sending missionaries: &#8220;After they had fasted and prayed, they laid hands on them and sent them off&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>).<p>&#8226;Appointing leaders: Paul and Barnabas &#8220;appointed elders for them in every church&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>).<p>The plurality of &#8220;elders&#8221; highlights shared oversight. Laying on of hands symbolizes identification, blessing, and a tangible conduit for God&#8217;s grace (<a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a> again notes Paul&#8217;s personal involvement). It is both an impartation moment and an official recognition of Timothy&#8217;s ministry before the congregation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul urges Timothy to value and exercise his Spirit-bestowed gift. That gift was pinpointed through prophetic revelation and publicly affirmed when church elders laid hands on him. Together, these elements teach that God sovereignly equips believers, the church confirms and commissions, and each recipient must actively steward what the Lord has entrusted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy.</span>--Here the Apostle reminds his representative in the Ephesian congregation of his special gift of teaching and exhortation--that divine gift which had been conferred on Timothy at his solemn ordination long ago, when the young son of Eunice was designated for the post which John Mark had once held with the Apostle. It was in many respects a similar office, that which Timothy held about St. Paul, to that which in old days Elisha had held with Elijah; and, as in the case of the Hebrew prophet of the old dispensation, so here, the choice of St. Paul had been divinely guided. The very titles of the old covenant dispensation seem to have been revived in this instance of the divine selection of Timothy; for in <a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm" title="But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.">1Timothy 6:11</a> the older Apostle addresses his representative at Ephesus with the old prophetic title when he writes: "<span class= "ital">Thou, O man of God, </span>flee these things." <span class= "ital">Now</span> he solemnly calls attention to that strange, miraculous "grace" which some inspired prophet at his ordination declared was to be conferred on Timothy. The "gift" was said to be conferred, as to its certainty in the divine counsels, by such prophecy--the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of one or more of His prophets, declaring His will and intention to confer this special grace on the young companion of St. Paul.<p><span class= "bld">With the laying on of the hands.</span>--This was a symbolic action--the outward sign of an inward communication of the Holy Spirit for some spiritual office or undertaking--and was derived from the old solemn Hebrew custom. (See <a href="/numbers/8-10.htm" title="And you shall bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands on the Levites:">Numbers 8:10</a> in the case of the consecration of the Levites, and <a href="/numbers/27-18.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him;">Numbers 27:18</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the children of Israel listened to him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.">Deuteronomy 34:9</a> in the ceremony of the dedication of Joshua.)<p><span class= "bld">Of the presbytery.</span>--The brotherhood of presbyters connected with the place where the ordination of Timothy took place is here alluded to. There appears to have been such a body of elders in each particular city or district. The presbytery in this instance would seem in all probability to have belonged to the district of Lystra, Timothy's native city; but an old ecclesiastical tradition speaks of Ephesus as the place of this ordination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gift</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>).

Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> came to be especially applied to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which are preeminently "free gifts" (see <a href="/acts/8-20.htm">Acts 8:20</a>). It is so applied in <a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4, 9, 28, 30, 31</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>. Here, then, as in the similar passage, <a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>, the "<span class="accented">gift"</span> spoken of is the special grace given by the Holy Ghost to those who are separated for "<span class="accented">the</span> office and work of a priest in the Church of God by the imposition of hands" (Ordering of Priests).

In <a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and Hebrews 8:9, imply a contemptuous disregard. So here Timothy is reminded that in his ordination he received a great <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and that he must value it duly, and use it diligently. It must not be let lie slumbering and smoldering, but must be stirred up into a flame. The lesson here and in <a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a> seems to be that we must look back to our ordination, and to the spiritual grace given in it, as things not exhausted. The grace is there, but it must not be lightly thought cf. <span class="cmt_word">Which was given thee by prophecy.</span> This seems to be explained by <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a>, where Barnabas and Saul were separated for their work by the laying on of the hands apparently of the prophets and teachers, at the express command of the Holy Ghost, speaking doubtless by the mouth of one of the prophets. Timothy, it appears, was designated for his work by a like command of the Holy Ghost, speaking by one of the Church prophets, and received his commission by a like "<span class="accented">laying</span> on of hands" by the elders of the Church. If St. Paul refers, as he appears to do, to the same occasion in <a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>, then it appears that he laid his hands on Timothy, together with the presbyters, as is done by the bishop in the ordination of priests. <span class="cmt_word">The presbytery</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The word is borrowed from the Jewish nomenclature (see <a href="/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>; <span class="accented">Acts</span> 22:5). In a slightly different sense for "the office of a presbyter," Sus., 5:50 (Cod. Alex.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
