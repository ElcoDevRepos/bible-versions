This deliberate oversight is a recurring theme in Scripture, where people often turn away from the truth (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-20</a>). The context here is a warning against false teachers and scoffers who deny the second coming of Christ, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3-4</a>.<p><b>that long ago by God&#8217;s word</b><br>The emphasis on "God's word" highlights the power and authority of divine command. This echoes the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks the universe into existence. The phrase underscores the belief in the inerrancy and authority of Scripture, as God's word is seen as the ultimate truth and creative force (<a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>).<p><b>the heavens existed</b><br>This refers to the creation of the heavens, as described in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. The heavens, in biblical terms, often denote the sky, the universe, and the spiritual realm. The existence of the heavens by God's word affirms His sovereignty over all creation and counters any naturalistic explanations of the universe's origins.<p><b>and the earth was formed out of water and by water</b><br>This phrase recalls the Genesis creation narrative, particularly <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the earth is described as being formless and covered by water. The formation of the earth "out of water and by water" can also be linked to the separation of waters in <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-10</a>. Water is a significant element in biblical symbolism, often representing chaos, life, and purification. The use of water in creation signifies God's control over chaos and His ability to bring order and life. This also prefigures the role of water in the Flood narrative (Genesis 6-9), where God uses water both as a means of judgment and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, addressing the early Christian community and warning them about false teachers and scoffers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scoffers.htm">Scoffers</a></b><br>Individuals who mock or doubt the promises of God, particularly the return of Christ, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/bsb/2_peter/3.htm">2 Peter 3</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event referenced in this verse, where God created the heavens and the earth, emphasizing His sovereign power and authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens_and_earth.htm">Heavens and Earth</a></b><br>The physical universe created by God, highlighting His role as the Creator.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_word.htm">God&#8217;s Word</a></b><br>The divine command through which creation came into existence, underscoring the power and authority of God's spoken word.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>God's word is not just informative but transformative and creative.

The notion is that of coherence, solidarity, and order, as distinct from chaos. "Out of [the] water" indicates the material out of which the earth was made; not, as our version leads us to suppose, that out of which the earth rose, like an island from the ocean. "In the water" is wrong, and again the error is probably derived from Geneva, though Tyndale has it also. We should render rather, <span class= "ital">by means of [the] water.</span> In both clauses the article should perhaps be omitted--<span class= "ital">the earth consisting out of water and through water.</span> (Comp. <a href="/psalms/24-2.htm" title="For he has founded it on the seas, and established it on the floods.">Psalm 24:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-6.htm" title="To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 136:6</a>.) In the <span class= "ital">Clementine Homilies</span> (XI. xxiv.) we have the idea of all things being made by water. In the Greek "by the word of God comes last, not first; emphasis is obtained either way. "By the word of God;" not by a fortuitous concourse of atoms, not by spontaneous generation. In the <span class= "ital">Shepherd</span> of Hermas (I. <span class= "ital">Vis.</span> I. iii. 4) we read, "Behold, the God of virtues (powers). . . . by His mighty word has fixed the heaven, and laid the foundation of the earth upon the waters." (See above on ii. 1, 3, 13, 15, 20.) In an <span class= "ital">Apology</span> of Melito, Bishop of Sardis, addressed to Antoninus Caesar about A.D. 170, there is a passage bearing a considerable amount of resemblance to these verses (<a href="/context/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2Peter 3:5-7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this they willingly are ignorant of;</span> literally, for <span class="accented">this escapes them of their own will.</span> All things have not always been as they are; there have been great changes; there was once a great catastrophe; but this they willfully forget, Huther translates differently, "For, whilst they assert this, it is hidden from them that," etc. But this rendering seems forced and unsatisfactory, and gives a meaning to <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> which it has nowhere in the New Testament. <span class="cmt_word">That by the Word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water.</span> The Revised Version translates, <span class="accented">That there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the Word of God.</span> The mockers say that all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation. That creation itself was a great, a stupendous change, a mighty effort of the power of God. St. Peter refers to it in words evidently derived from the Book of Genesis, not from any other sources, whether Greek, Egyptian, or Indian. There were heavens from of old (the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a>). There was an earth formed or standing out of the water. The Greek participle here used is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, literally, "standing together or consisting" (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>); it may be taken closely with both prepositional Clauses, "earth consisting of water and by means of water." Thales had taught that water was the beginning of things, the original element (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); the narrative in Genesis represents water as originally overspreading all things: "The earth was without form [<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint], and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." We may therefore understand St. Peter as meaning that the earth was formed or compacted out of water, or out of those substances which the water at first held in solution; and that it is kept together in coherence and solidity by means of water. If, on the other hand, we regard the participle as closely connected with the second preposition only, the meaning will be that the earth, held together and compacted by means of water, rose up out of the water, and appeared above it, when God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear." It is possible, again, to understand the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> locally, and to translate "amidst water." Comp. <a href="/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a>, "He stretched out the earth above the waters;" and <a href="/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>, "He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods." Of course, neither St. Peter nor Moses is speaking in the language of science; their object was, not to teach scientific truth, but to present the great fact of creation in an aspect suitable to our poor capacities. For the clause, "by the Word of God (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>)," comp. <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)." St. Peter may be referring to the formula, "And God said," so constantly repeated in the account of the creation, or (what is really the same truth) to the fact that "all things were made by him [by God the Word], and without him was not anything made that was made." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[But]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
