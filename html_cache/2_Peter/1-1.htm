He was a fisherman by trade and was called by Jesus to be a "fisher of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). Peter is often seen as the leader of the apostles and played a significant role in the early church. His name, given by Jesus, means "rock" (<a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>), symbolizing his foundational role in the church (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p><b>a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ</b><br>Peter identifies himself first as a servant, emphasizing humility and submission to Christ. The term "servant" (Greek: doulos) implies total devotion and obedience. As an apostle, Peter was a messenger and witness of Jesus' resurrection (<a href="/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>). His dual role highlights both his authority and his commitment to serving Christ and the church.<p><b>To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine nature of Jesus, affirming His deity. The righteousness mentioned here is not human righteousness but the perfect righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to believers (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). This righteousness is the basis for salvation and is a gift from God, not earned by works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>have received a faith as precious as ours</b><br>The faith referred to is the same saving faith that the apostles themselves possess. It is described as "precious," indicating its immense value and worth. This faith is not exclusive to the apostles but is available to all believers, Jew and Gentile alike, signifying the universality of the gospel (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).

"Simon" has probably been substituted as being more usual. The Geneva Bible, which our translators unfortunately sometimes follow when it is <span class= "ital">misleading, </span>has "Simeon." "Symeon," of St. Peter, occurs elsewhere only <a href="/acts/15-14.htm" title="Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.">Acts 15:14</a>, in a speech of the strongly Jewish St. James. As being the more Jewish form of the name, it points to a Jewish Christian as the author; and as being unusual, it shows that the writer, if not the Apostle, is no slavish imitator. As coming from St. Peter, the Apostle of the circumcision, it is natural enough. The differences between this opening and that of 1 Peter are instructive. There, as approaching communities which might seem to belong to St. Paul, he carefully suppresses everything personal; he calls himself merely "Peter," the name which Christ Himself had given him along with his high commission (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>), and "Apostle," the title which stated his commission. Here, as coming a second time to those who now know him better (both through his former Epistle and through Silvanus), he adds personal designations. There, as if not venturing to depart greatly from his own peculiar field, he addresses himself mainly to the Jewish converts. Here, with more boldness, the natural result of increased familiarity, he addresses Gentile converts chiefly. (See Note on <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A servant and an apostle.</span>--De Wette suspects a combination of <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a> with <a href="/jude/1-1.htm" title="Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:">Jude 1:1</a>. The coincidence is too slight to argue upon. (See <a href="/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a> and Note on <a href="/jude/1-1.htm" title="Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:">Jude 1:1</a>.) The amount of similarity between the opening verses of Jude and those of this Epistle is too small for any conclusions as to the dependence of one on the other. Although the word for "servant" strictly means <span class= "ital">slave, </span>the English version is quite correct. (See on <a href="/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Simon Peter.</span> "Symeon" seems to be the best-supported spelling in this place. The same form of the name is found in <a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a> and <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>; it also occurs in <a href="/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>, where St. James refers to St. Peter's speech on the great question of the circumcision of Gentile Christians. It is the form always used in the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament. The old man's thoughts go back to his early years; he describes himself by the familiar name of his youth; he uses that Greek form of it which was most distinctively Jewish. But he joins with the old name, which spoke of Judaism, the new name which the Lord Jesus had given him - the name which describes him as a stone or rock, which indicates also his close connection with that Rock on which the Church is built, which is Christ. His names combine Hebrew and Greek, Jewish and Christian, associations. He is writing probably, as in his First Epistle, to Churches of mingled Jewish and Gentile elements. The first word of the Epistle supplies an argument for the genuineness of the Epistle. It is scarcely possible that an imitator, who was acquainted with the First Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>), and shows, as some say, so much anxiety to identify himself with the apostle (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12-18</a>), would have announced himself by a name different from that used in the First Epistle, and would have adopted a form of the Hebrew name varying from that which occurs so frequently in the Gospels. <span class="cmt_word">A servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.</span> St. Peter, like St. Paul, describes himself as a servant, literally, "a slave," a bondman of Jesus Christ. We are not our own; we are bought with a price; we have work to do for our Master. St. Peter's work was that of a missionary, an apostle sent into the world to win souls for Christ (comp. <a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them that have obtained like precious faith with us.</span> The word rendered "obtained" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) means properly "to obtain by lot," as in <a href="/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>. It is noticeable that one of the few places in which it occurs in the New Testament is in a speech of St. Peter's (<a href="/acts/1-17.htm">Acts 1:17</a>); its use here implies that faith is a gift of God. The word for "like precious" equally precious) is found only here in the New Testament; it calls to our memory the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>, and indicates a correspondence with the First Epistle. St. Peter addresses this Epistle simply to those who have obtained an equally precious faith "with us." By the last words he may mean himself only, or the apostles generally, or, possibly, all Jewish Christians. He is writing apparently to the same Churches to which his First Epistle was addressed (verse 16 and chapter 1 Peter 3:1); he says that their faith is equally precious with that of the apostles, or perhaps that the Gentiles have received the like precious gift with the chosen people. By "faith" he may mean the truths believed, as <a href="/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>; or, more probably, faith in the subjective sense, the grace of faith, which receives those truths as a message from God (comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span> Some commentators, as Luther, Estius, etc., understand by "righteousness" in this place, the righteousness which God gives, as in <a href="/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>, etc. But this seems unsuitable here; for faith is not given in righteousness, but rather righteousness in faith. Others take righteousness as the object of the faith - "to them that have Obtained faith in the righteousness;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, who are enabled to believe in God's righteousness and to trust in it. This seems a forced interpretation. It is better to take the preposition as meaning "in the working of God's righteousness," in the sphere of its operation, and to understand "righteousness" as the attribute of God, his just and holy dealing with men. There is no respect of persons with God; in his righteousness he bestows the like precious faith on all who come to him, without distinction of race or country. According to the strict grammatical construction of the passage, "God" and "Saviour" are both predicates of "Jesus Christ," as in <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>. The First and Second Persons of the blessed Trinity are distinguished in the following verse, and this has led several commentators to think that the same distinction should be made here. It is true that the absence of a second article does not make it absolutely certain that the two words "God" and "Saviour" must be taken as united under the one common article, and so regarded as two predicates of "Jesus Christ;" but it furnishes at least a very strong presumption in favour of this view, especially as there is not here, as there is in <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, any word like <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to give definiteness to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see Bishop Ellicott's note on Titus 2:13, and, on the other side, Alford's notes on both passages). The Lord Jesus is called "our Saviour" five times in this Epistle. The word does not occur in the First Epistle; but in St. Peter's speech (<a href="/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>) the apostle declared to the Sanhedrin that God had exalted Jesus "to be a Prince and a Saviour." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Simon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Syme&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4826.htm">Strong's 4826: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simeon or Simon.
