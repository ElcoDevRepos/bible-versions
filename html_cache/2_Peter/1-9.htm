Such a man can only see the things which lie close around him - earth and earthly things; he cannot lift up his eyes by faith and behold "the land that is very far off;" he cannot "see the King in his beauty" (<a href="/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). The word for "short-sighted" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament.

Ananias had said to Saul, "Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins" (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>); St. Peter himself had said, in his first great sermon, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." Those who do not realize in the religious life that death unto sin of which holy baptism is the sign and the beginning, incur forgetfulness of the cleansing from sin which they then received; they do not use the grace once given for the attainment of those higher graces of which St. Peter has been speaking. The one talent once entrusted to them must be taken from them; they are idle and unfruitful, and cannot reach unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[But]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
