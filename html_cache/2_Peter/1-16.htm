In the Greco-Roman world, myths and fables were common, often used to explain natural phenomena or convey moral lessons. Peter asserts that the gospel is not a product of human imagination or myth-making. This claim counters the false teachings and heresies that were beginning to infiltrate the early church, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>. The apostles' teachings are rooted in historical events and divine revelation, distinguishing them from the fictional stories prevalent in the culture.<p><b>when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>Peter refers to the proclamation of Jesus' divine power and His anticipated return. The "power" signifies the miraculous works and authority of Jesus, as witnessed by the apostles. The "coming" (Greek: parousia) refers to the second coming of Christ, a central tenet of Christian eschatology. This expectation is consistent with Jesus' own promises (<a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>) and the teachings of other apostles (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>). The early church lived in anticipation of this event, which provided hope and motivation for holy living.<p><b>but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty</b><br>Peter underscores the credibility of his testimony by highlighting his firsthand experience. The term "majesty" likely alludes to the Transfiguration of Jesus, where Peter, James, and John witnessed Christ's divine glory (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-8</a>). This event confirmed Jesus' identity as the Son of God and prefigured His future glory at the second coming. The eyewitness account serves as a powerful validation of the apostolic message, distinguishing it from speculative or secondhand reports.

Peter treats that return as certain, not symbolic.<p>- The combination&#8212;past power, future coming&#8212;means the whole redemptive plan has already been displayed and will be completed.<p>- By proclaiming both, the apostles fulfilled Jesus&#8217; commission in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, giving the church a hope that stands firm amid persecution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty</b><p>- Peter stakes everything on personal experience: he, James, and John saw Jesus transfigured (<a href="/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>- That event supplied a preview of the glory believers will see at Christ&#8217;s return (<a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17&#8211;18</a> follows this verse to recount it).<p>- Eyewitness testimony anchored early gospel preaching (<a href="/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>- It also satisfies Old Testament law requiring two or three witnesses to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The apostles&#8217; united witness surpasses that legal standard.<p>- Because they saw &#8220;His majesty,&#8221; they can assure us that the same Lord will one day reign openly (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Peter&#8217;s single verse offers a threefold assurance: the gospel is not fabricated, it announces both the demonstrated power and guaranteed return of Christ, and it rests on solid eyewitness testimony. Therefore believers can cling confidently to the apostolic message, knowing it is true, certain, and anchored in the revealed majesty of the risen Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_peter/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16-21) The certainty of Christ's coming again is the basis of these exhortations; and that certainty is proved (1) by the Transfiguration, which was an anticipation of His coming again in glory; (2) by the utterances of the prophets who predicted it.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">For we have not followed.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">For we did not follow, </span>or, <span class= "ital">It was not by following out, &c., that. "</span>For" introduces the reason for "I will endeavour" above. The word for "follow," or "follow out," occurs again in <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2Peter 2:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>, and nowhere else in the New Testament.<p><span class= "bld">Cunningly devised fables.</span>--We cannot be sure that any in particular are meant, whether heathen, Jewish, or Christian; the negative makes the statement quite general. Various things, however, have been suggested as possibly indicated--heathen mythology, Jewish theosophy, Gnostic systems (as yet quite in their infancy in Simon Magus, St. Peter's adversary), and Apocryphal Gospels. Probably some elements in the doctrine of the false teachers are alluded to; something analogous to the "feigned words" of <a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2Peter 2:3</a>. There is reason for believing that the particular elements in their teaching thus incidentally condemned were of <span class= "ital">Jewish</span> origin. If this conjecture be correct, then <span class= "ital">St.</span> Peter is here dealing with errors similar to those condemned by St. Paul (<a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm" title="And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned to fables.">2Timothy 4:4</a>; <a href="/titus/1-14.htm" title="Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.">Titus 1:14</a>--the only other passages in which the word "fables" occurs). And in this case much light is thrown on some of the marked peculiarities of this Epistle and that of St. Jude, viz., the fondness of both writers for the oldest, and sometimes the most obscure<span class= "bld">When we made known unto you.</span>--It is difficult to determine to what this refers. It is erroneous to suppose that the phrase necessarily implies personal communication by word of mouth. In the First Epistle the Apostle wrote to congregations not personally acquainted with him; and we have no reason for assuming that he had visited them since. "When we made known" may possibly refer to the First Epistle, against which supposition the plural "we" is not conclusive. Or a written Gospel--and, if so, the one with which St. Peter is commonly connected, viz., that of St. Mark--may be in the Apostle's mind. But the simplest explanation is that he refers to the Apostolic teaching generally. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables;</span> rather, <span class="accented">did not follow.</span> The participle (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is aorist. This compound verb is used only by St. Peter in the New Testament; we find it again in <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm">2 Peter 2:2</a> and 15. Bengel and others have thought that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, from or out of, implies wandering from the truth after false guides; but probably the word merely means "to follow closely," though in this case the guides were going astray. Perhaps the use of the plural number is accounted for by the fact that St. Peter was not the only witness of the glory of the Transfiguration; he associates in thought his two brother-apostles with himself. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fe6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, fables, with this exception, occurs in the New Testament only in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles. There is a remarkable parallel in the procemium of the 'Antiquities' of Josephus, sect. 4, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Peter may be referring to the "Jewish fables" mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>), or to the stories about the heathen gods such as those in Hesiod and Ovid, or possibly to some early inventions, such as those ascribed to Simon the Sorcerer, which were afterwards to be developed into the strange fictions of Gnosticism (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>). The word rendered "cunningly devised" occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>; but there a different part of the verb is used, and in a different sense. <span class="cmt_word">When we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> St. Peter can scarcely be referring to St. Paul or other missionaries, as the following words identify the preachers with the witnesses of the Transfiguration; he must be alluding either to his First Epistle (comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>), or to personal teaching of his which has not been recorded, or, just possibly, to the Gospel of St. Mark. St. Peter had seen the power of the Lord Jesus manifested in his miracles; he had heard the announcement of the risen Saviour, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;" he had, like the rest of the apostles, been "endued with power from on high." By the coming (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) he must mean the second advent, the invariable meaning of the word in Holy Scripture (see chapter 2 Peter 3:4, <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3, 27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">But were eye-witnesses of his majesty.</span> The word for "eye-witnesses" is not the common one (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, used by St. <a href="/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>), but a technical word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), which in classical Greek designates the highest class of those who had been initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. The choice of such a word may possibly imply that St. Peter regarded himself and his brother-apostles as having received the highest initiation into the mysteries of religion. The noun is found only here in the New Testament; but the corresponding verb occurs in <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a> and 1 Pet 3:2, and in no other of the New Testament writers. Here again we have an undesigned coincidence which points to identity of authorship. The word for "majesty" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs in St. Luke's description of the healing of the demoniac boy immediately after the Transfiguration (<a href="/luke/9-43.htm">Luke 9:43</a>), and elsewhere only in <a href="/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
