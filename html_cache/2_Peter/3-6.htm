In the context of <a href="/2_peter/3.htm">2 Peter 3</a>, the "through which" points back to the "water" mentioned in the previous verse. Water is a recurring symbol of both judgment and purification in the Bible. The floodwaters in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a> were the instrument of God's judgment on a sinful world, demonstrating His sovereignty over creation.<p><b>the world of that time</b><br>This phrase indicates the specific period before the flood, often referred to as the antediluvian world. This era was characterized by widespread wickedness and corruption, as described in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a>. The "world of that time" contrasts with the post-flood world, highlighting the drastic change brought about by God's intervention. Archaeological evidence of ancient flood narratives in various cultures supports the biblical account of a significant flood event.<p><b>perished</b><br>The term "perished" underscores the totality of the destruction that occurred. In <a href="/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21-23</a>, it is recorded that all living creatures on the earth were wiped out, except for those preserved in the ark. This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and the seriousness of God's judgment. The flood is a type of the final judgment, as Jesus Himself draws a parallel in <a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-39</a>, warning of the suddenness and completeness of the coming judgment.<p><b>in the flood</b><br>The flood is a central event in biblical history, marking a pivotal point in God's dealings with humanity. It serves as a type of baptism, as noted in <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20-21</a>, symbolizing both death to the old world and the emergence of a new creation. The flood narrative also foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who provides a way of salvation from judgment, just as the ark provided safety for Noah and his family. The floodwaters, while destructive, also purged the earth, allowing for a fresh start, much like the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the epistle, addressing the early Christian church and warning them about false teachers and scoffers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world_of_that_time.htm">The World of That Time</a></b><br>Refers to the pre-flood world, which was characterized by widespread wickedness and ultimately judged by God through the flood.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flood.htm">The Flood</a></b><br>A cataclysmic event described in Genesis, where God judged the earth with water, sparing only Noah and his family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man who found favor with God and was instructed to build the ark, through which he and his family were saved from the flood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/scoffers.htm">Scoffers</a></b><br>Individuals mentioned earlier in the chapter who mock the promise of Christ's return, questioning the reality of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>Just as the flood was a real historical event, so too is the promise of Christ's return and final judgment.

The original literally signifies, <span class= "ital">by means of which things.</span> But what things? The context allows various alternatives: (1) These facts about the Creation; (2) the heavens and the earth; (3) the water out of which, and the water by means of which, the world was made; (4) any or all of these together with the word of God. There is good reason for preferring the second of these. Both the heavens and the earth contributed to the deluge; for then "all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened" (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm" title="In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.">Genesis 7:11</a>). The English "whereby" is as vague as the original.<p><span class= "bld">The world that then was, . . . perished.</span>--So that it is absurd to say that all things continue unchanged since the Creation. The world was so transformed by the deluge that the world previous to that catastrophe perished, chaos for the moment returned, and a new world issued from the crisis. "The world that then was, perished" is equivalent to "He spared not the old world" in <a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2Peter 2:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.</span> The Greek for" whereby" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "through which things." The plural here presents some difficulty. The most obvious antecedents are "the heavens and the earth" of the last verse; but many commentators refer the relative to the twice-repeated "water." The meaning will be the same whichever view we take. "The fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened;" that is, the Deluge was brought to pass by means of the heavens, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the waters that were above the firmament, and the earth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the waters that were below the firmament, which came from the earth as the waters first mentioned came from the heavens. Another possible view is that of Huther, who refers <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to the water and the Word of God. By the world here must be meant the world of living creatures. This is St. Peter's answer to the mockers: there had been one great catastrophe; there will be another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8039;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Genitive Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
