Paul's letters often address complex theological issues such as justification by faith, the role of the law, and the nature of the church. This phrase highlights the unity and coherence in Paul's epistles, which were circulated among early Christian communities. The phrase "such matters" likely refers to eschatological themes, moral exhortations, and doctrinal teachings that are central to Paul's writings. This acknowledgment by Peter underscores the authority and significance of Paul's contributions to the New Testament canon.<p><b>Some parts of his letters are hard to understand,</b><br>Peter admits that certain teachings in Paul's letters are difficult to comprehend. This difficulty may arise from the deep theological concepts Paul addresses, such as the mystery of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4</a>) and the relationship between grace and works (<a href="/romans/11-6.htm">Romans 11:6</a>). The complexity of these topics requires careful study and spiritual discernment. This acknowledgment serves as a reminder of the need for humility and reliance on the Holy Spirit for understanding Scripture (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><b>which ignorant and unstable people distort,</b><br>Peter warns against those who lack proper understanding and spiritual maturity, who twist Paul's teachings. The term "ignorant" suggests a lack of knowledge or insight, while "unstable" implies a lack of firm grounding in the faith. These individuals may misinterpret or deliberately alter the message to suit their own agendas, leading to false teachings and heresies. This distortion of Scripture is a recurring issue in the early church, as seen in Paul's own warnings against false teachers (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>).<p><b>as they do the rest of the Scriptures,</b><br>Peter equates Paul's letters with "the rest of the Scriptures," indicating their divine inspiration and authority. This comparison places Paul's writings on the same level as the Old Testament, affirming their role in the Christian canon. The early church recognized the inspiration of the apostles' writings, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, where Paul quotes both Deuteronomy and the Gospel of Luke as Scripture. This phrase underscores the continuity and unity of God's revelation through both the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>to their own destruction.</b><br>The distortion of Scripture leads to spiritual ruin and judgment. This warning echoes the broader biblical theme that mishandling God's Word results in severe consequences (<a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18-19</a>). The phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the responsibility to rightly divide the word of truth (<a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>) and the dangers of false teaching. It emphasizes the importance of sound doctrine and the need for believers to be vigilant against those who would lead them astray.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, addressing the early Christian communities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>Another apostle whose letters are referenced by Peter as containing complex teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/ignorant_and_unstable_people.htm">Ignorant and Unstable People</a></b><br>Individuals who misinterpret or distort the teachings of Paul and other Scriptures.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, who are being warned about false teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/scriptures.htm">Scriptures</a></b><br>Refers to the sacred writings, including the Old Testament and the emerging New Testament texts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_scripture.htm">The Complexity of Scripture</a></b><br>Recognize that some parts of Scripture are challenging and require diligent study and spiritual discernment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_distortion.htm">The Danger of Distortion</a></b><br>Be aware of the potential for misinterpretation and distortion of biblical teachings, which can lead to spiritual harm.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_spiritual_maturity.htm">The Role of Spiritual Maturity</a></b><br>Seek to grow in spiritual maturity to better understand and apply the teachings of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_context.htm">The Importance of Context</a></b><br>Always consider the context of biblical passages to avoid misinterpretation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_need_for_community.htm">The Need for Community</a></b><br>Engage with a community of believers to discuss and discern the meaning of difficult passages.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Peter_3_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Peter 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Avoid_distorting_Scripture_how.htm">How can we discern and avoid "distorting" Scripture as warned in 2 Peter 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_spiritual_maturity_aid_Scripture.htm">What role does spiritual maturity play in understanding difficult passages in Scripture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/2_Peter_3_16_Paul_s_scriptural_views.htm">How does 2 Peter 3:16 connect with Paul's teachings on scriptural interpretation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_recognize_Paul_s_authority.htm">Why is it important to recognize the authority of Paul's writings in our faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_false_teachings_today_2.htm">How can we guard against being "led astray" by false teachings today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Peter_3_16_on_Paul_s_letters_complexity.htm">How does 2 Peter 3:16 address the complexity of interpreting Paul's letters?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_Paul_s_letters_hard_to_grasp.htm">Why are Paul's letters considered difficult to understand according to 2 Peter 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Peter_3_16_on_Paul_s_authority.htm">What does 2 Peter 3:16 imply about the authority of Paul's writings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_peter_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Peter 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'twisting_scriptures'_mean.htm">What does "Twisting Scriptures to Their Own Destruction" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_do_christians_differ_on_the_bible.htm">Why do Christians interpret the Bible differently?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_is_the_bible_simplified_for_kids.htm">What does 'Twisting Scriptures to Their Own Destruction' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_is_the_bible's_language_complex.htm">If the Bible was meant to be understood by all, why is it written in complex, often ambiguous language?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 2 Peter 3:16 Mean</div><b>He writes this way in all his letters</b><p>Peter has just mentioned &#8220;our beloved brother Paul&#8221;

The expression does not necessarily Imply that St. Paul was dead, and that his Epistles had been collected into one volume. That each church made a collection of them as they became known to it, and that in the great centres they became known soon after they were written, are conjectures of great probability.<p><span class= "bld">Speaking in them of these things</span>--viz., of the return of Christ and of the destruction of the world. Some, however, understand the words as meaning the exhortations to holiness here given.<p><span class= "bld">Some things hard to be understood.</span>--Certainly the difficulties with which 2 Thessalonians 2 bristles are well described by this expression, and they relate to the very point in question--the time of Christ's coming. Moreover, scoffers could easily turn them to account by arguing that "the man of sin" had not yet appeared, and that therefore there was no likelihood of the end of the world coming just yet. But in admitting that 2 Thessalonians 2 is among the passages alluded to here, we are not committed to the theory that 1 and 2 Thess. are alluded to in <a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm" title="And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;">2Peter 3:15</a>. Many refer these words to St. Paul's doctrine of justification by faith as wrested to mean "faith without works." So, again, <a href="/context/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5-6</a>, and <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a> might be wrested to mean that "the resurrection is past already" (<a href="/2_timothy/2-18.htm" title="Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.">2Timothy 2:18</a>). (See Note on <a href="/romans/3-8.htm" title="And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.">Romans 3:8</a> respecting perversion of his teaching.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As also in all his Epistles.</span> The true reading is probably <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> without the article. The words, therefore, do not imply the existence of a complete collection of St. Paul's Epistles, but mean only "in all Epistles which he writes." <span class="cmt_word">Speaking in them of these things;</span> that is, of the day of God, the end of the world, etc. St. Peter was acquainted with other Epistles of St. Paul besides those addressed to the Asiatic Churches. There are evident indications of his knowledge of the Epistles to the Thessalonians and Corinthians, as well as of that to the Romans. <span class="cmt_word">In which are some things hard to be understood.</span> The manuscripts vary between <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. The first reading would refer to the words immediately preceding - "these things;" "among the subjects on which St. Paul wrote there are some things," etc. The second would refer to "all his Epistles," and would mean that there are certain difficulties in St. Paul's Epistles generally. St. Peter does not tell us what difficulties were in his thoughts - whether St. Paul's teaching about "the man of sin," and "the day of the Lord," or his doctrine of justification by faith, and his assertion of Christian liberty, which might be perverted into anti-nomianism by such men as the false teachers censured in chapter 2. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "hard to be understood," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the ignorant and unsteadfast.</span> Both words are peculiar to this Epistle; the last occurs also in <a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>, the first here only in the New Testament. The verb also translated "wrest" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is found only here; it means "to twist with a windlass," and so "to strain, to torture, to distort." <span class="cmt_word">As they do also the other Scriptures.</span> This passage is of the greatest interest, as showing that some of St. Paul's Epistles had by this time taken their place in the estimate of Christians by the side of the sacred books of the Old Testament, and were regarded as Holy Scripture. By "the other Scriptures" St. Peter means the Old Testament, and also, perhaps, some of the earlier writings of the New, as the first three Gospels and the Epistle of St. James. St. Paul, in <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, quotes a passage which seems to come from <a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a> as Scripture (comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto their own destruction;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their own destruction of themselves.</span> The use of both adjective and pronoun intensifies the meaning (comp. chapter 2 Peter 2:1, 12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[ He writes ] this way</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
