His rescue is a testament to God's ability to deliver the righteous from judgment. This event is recorded in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where angels lead Lot and his family out of Sodom before its destruction. Lot's rescue prefigures the deliverance of believers from God's coming judgment, highlighting God's mercy and justice. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness to His promises, as Lot was spared due to Abraham's intercession (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23-33</a>).<p><b>a righteous man</b><br>Lot is described as righteous, which may seem surprising given his later actions and choices. However, his righteousness is attributed to his faith and relationship with God, not his moral perfection. This aligns with the biblical theme that righteousness is imputed by faith, as seen in Abraham's example (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). Lot's righteousness is further evidenced by his distress over the sinfulness of Sodom, indicating a heart aligned with God's values.<p><b>distressed by the depraved conduct</b><br>Lot's distress highlights the internal conflict experienced by believers living in a sinful world. His soul was tormented by the rampant immorality around him, reflecting a sensitivity to sin that characterizes the righteous. This mirrors the experience of believers today, who are called to be in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>). Lot's distress serves as a call to maintain spiritual integrity and a godly perspective amidst moral decay.<p><b>of the lawless</b><br>The term "lawless" refers to those who live in blatant disregard for God's commands. Sodom's inhabitants exemplified such lawlessness, engaging in acts that were abhorrent to God (<a href="/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4-5</a>). This lawlessness is contrasted with the righteousness of Lot, underscoring the biblical theme of the righteous versus the wicked. The destruction of Sodom serves as a warning of the consequences of living without regard for God's law, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>A nephew of Abraham, Lot is described as a "righteous man" who lived in the city of Sodom.

In Sodom&#8217;s midnight, Lot&#8217;s allegiance to the Lord still distinguished him:<p>&#8226; He welcomed the visiting angels when no one else would (<a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; He grieved over sin instead of celebrating it (<a href="/proverbs/14-9.htm">Proverbs 14:9</a>).<p>God counts such trust and obedience as righteousness, even when mingled with human weakness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>distressed</b><p>The word pictures a continual, aching burden.

Their disregard invited swift judgment (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>). Believers today still live among the lawless, yet God&#8217;s promise holds: He knows how &#8220;to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7</a> spotlights God&#8217;s faithful pattern: He intertwines judgment and deliverance. While the lawless rush toward destruction, the Lord singles out the righteous, counts them His, feels their pain, and pulls them to safety. Lot&#8217;s rescue assures every modern believer that no darkness is too thick, no culture too corrupt, for God to reach in, lift out, and preserve those who belong to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_peter/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And delivered just Lot.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">righteous Lot</span>; it is the same adjective as occurs twice in the next verse. These repetitions of the same word, of which there are several examples in this Epistle ("destruction" thrice, <a href="/context/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1-3</a>; various repetitions, <a href="/context/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10-12</a>; "look for" thrice, <a href="/context/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2Peter 3:12-14</a>, &c), and which have been stigmatised as showing poverty of language, are perfectly natural in St. Peter, and not like the laboured efforts of a writer endeavouring to personate him. A person writing under strong emotion does not stop to pick his words; he uses the same word over and over again if it expresses what he means and no other word at once occurs to him. This is still more likely to be the case when a person is writing in a foreign language. The fact that such repetitions are frequent in the Second Epistle, but not in the First, is not only fully explained by the circumstances, but, as being so entirely in harmony with them, may be regarded as a mark of genuineness. "Delivered righteous Lot." Here, as in the case of the Flood (<a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2Peter 2:5</a>), the destruction of the guilty suggests the preservation of the innocent. Is it fanciful to think that these lights in a dark picture are characteristic of one who had himself "denied the Master who bought him," and yet had been preserved like Noah and rescued like Lot? This brighter side is wanting in Jude, so that in the strictly historical illustrations this Epistle is more full than the other (see Note on <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>); it is where apocryphal books seem to be alluded to that St. Jude has more detail.<p><span class= "bld">The filthy conversation.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">behaviour in wantonness</span> (comp. <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2Peter 2:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2Peter 2:18</a>)--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>licentious mode of life.
