The prophets, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel, spoke of future events, including the coming of the Messiah and the end times. Their messages were often calls to repentance and reminders of God's covenant with Israel. The role of the prophets was crucial in preparing the way for Christ, and their writings are foundational to understanding God's plan for salvation. The call to recall these prophecies underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ.<p><b>and commanded by our Lord and Savior</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the authority of Jesus Christ, who is both Lord and Savior. His teachings and commands are central to the Christian faith, as seen in the Gospels. Jesus' commandments include the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the call to love God and neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>). The acknowledgment of Jesus as Lord and Savior reflects early Christian creeds and confessions, affirming His divinity and role in salvation. This phrase also connects to the idea that Jesus' teachings fulfill and expand upon the Old Testament law and prophecies.<p><b>through your apostles</b><br>The apostles were chosen by Jesus to be His messengers and witnesses to the world. They played a critical role in the early church, spreading the Gospel and establishing Christian doctrine. The apostles, such as Peter, John, and Paul, were instrumental in writing the New Testament and providing authoritative teaching for the church. Their teachings are seen as divinely inspired and foundational for Christian belief and practice.

Great stress is laid on the word of prophecy in both Epistles (see <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a> and <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>).

It is a remarkable expression; but Christ's apostles can be rightly called the apostles of those to whom they are sent, as being their teachers, sent to them for their benefit; just as the angels of God are called also the angels of Christ's little ones (<a href="/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a>). Compare also "the angels of the seven Churches" in the Revelation. St. Peter shows an intimate knowledge of several of St. Paul's Epistles, and of that of St. James; he is writing to the Churches addressed in his First Epistle, most of which were founded by St. Paul or his companions. We must therefore understand this passage, as well as verse 15 of this chapter, as a distinct recognition of the apostleship of St. Paul. The translation of the Authorized Version, "the apostles of the Lord and Saviour," involves a violent disturbance of the order; it seems best to make both genitives depend on "commandment:" "your apostles' commandment of the Lord;" the first genitive being that of announcement, the second of origin. The commandment was announced by the apostles, but it was the Lord's commandment. (For the double genitive, comp. <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a> and <a href="/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>. For the whole verse, see the parallel passage in <a href="/jude/1-17.htm">Jude 1:17</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">by recalling</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(mn&#275;sth&#275;nai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Passive<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3403.htm">Strong's 3403: </a> </span><span class="str2">To remember, call to mind, recall, mention.
