The context is the delay of the Second Coming, which some early Christians misunderstood as a sign of God's indifference or nonexistence. However, this delay is portrayed as God's merciful patience, allowing more time for repentance and salvation. This aligns with <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, which states that God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. The concept of divine patience is also seen in the Old Testament, such as in the story of Noah (Genesis 6-9), where God waited patiently while the ark was being built. This patience is a reflection of God's character, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God is described as "slow to anger."<p><b>just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the apostle Paul as a fellow worker in the faith and highlights the unity among the apostles. It suggests that Peter's audience was familiar with Paul's writings, indicating an early circulation of Pauline letters among the churches. This reference to Paul also underscores the consistency of the apostolic message. The term "beloved brother" reflects the close relationship and mutual respect between Peter and Paul, despite their earlier disagreements (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a>). This unity is crucial for the early church's witness and doctrinal integrity.<p><b>with the wisdom God gave him</b><br>This phrase attributes Paul's insights and teachings to divine wisdom, affirming the inspiration of his writings. It suggests that Paul's letters are not merely human opinions but are guided by the Holy Spirit. This aligns with <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, which states that all Scripture is God-breathed. The wisdom given to Paul is evident in his deep theological insights, such as the doctrine of justification by faith (<a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-26</a>) and the mystery of the church as the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/3.htm">Ephesians 3:1-6</a>).

This is an intentional act of reflection, not a passing thought.<p>&#8226; The command invites believers to engage their minds, much like <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a> calls us to &#8220;dwell on&#8221; what is true.<p>&#8226; Reflection anchors faith in revealed truth rather than emotion or speculation (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-7.htm">2 Timothy 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; By saying &#8220;also,&#8221; Peter links this new point to everything he has just taught about scoffers and the certainty of Christ&#8217;s return (<a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that our Lord&#8217;s patience brings salvation</b><p>&#8220;The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise&#8230; but is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s delay in judgment is deliberate mercy, mirrored in <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a> where His kindness is meant to lead to repentance.<p>&#8226; Paul testified personally: &#8220;For this reason I was shown mercy, so that in me&#8230; Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Every additional day before Christ&#8217;s return is an opportunity for more people to believe (<a href="/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Salvation here is not abstract; it is rescue from coming judgment, secured by Christ&#8217;s atoning work (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you</b><p>Peter warmly affirms Paul&#8217;s letters, showing unity among the apostles.<p>&#8226; Paul addressed the same audience regions&#8212;Galatia, Asia, Bithynia (<a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-2.htm">Galatians 1:2</a>)&#8212;with parallel teaching on God&#8217;s patience (<a href="/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; This endorsement counters false teachers who pitted apostolic voices against one another (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; The family language (&#8220;beloved brother&#8221;) highlights affection and mutual respect (<a href="/philemon/1-1.htm">Philemon 1:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter thus points his readers to reread Paul for reinforcement, doubling the witness (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the wisdom God gave him</b><p>Paul&#8217;s insight is divine, not merely intellectual.<p>&#8226; He himself said, &#8220;The gospel I preached is not from man&#8230; I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; True wisdom is &#8220;taught by the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-13.htm">1 Corinthians 2:13</a>); the same Spirit moved prophets and apostles (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Acknowledging God-given wisdom safeguards the church from dismissing hard passages (<a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16</a>) and reinforces the inspiration of all Scripture (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Depending on that wisdom keeps believers from leaning on their own understanding (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Peter invites believers to think deeply about God&#8217;s purposeful delay.

Far from signaling indifference, the wait before Christ&#8217;s return showcases divine mercy, giving every listener fresh incentive to trust the Savior today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_peter/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The longsuffering of our Lord.</span>--Again, as in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2Peter 3:9</a>, we are in doubt as to whether God the Father or the Lord Jesus is meant. In neither case is absolute certainty obtainable; but here the balance seems decidedly in favour of the latter meaning. In <a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8</a> "the Lord" certainly means God, and not the Lord Jesus (comp. <a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm" title="The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:">2Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-11.htm" title="Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.">2Peter 2:11</a>). In <a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever.

The two intermediate <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2Peter 3:9</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm" title="And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;">2Peter 3:15</a>, are open to dispute. The fact that "our" appears in this verse before "Lord," as in <a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.">2Peter 3:18</a>, inclines the balance here towards the meaning in <a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Moreover, had God been meant, it would have sufficed to say, "and account that <span class= "ital">His</span> long-suffering is salvation." If this is correct, and "our Lord" means Jesus Christ, "then throughout this weighty passage the Lord Jesus is invested with the full attributes of Deity." Here, possibly, as also in <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a> (see Note), the expression points to the writer's entire belief in the unity of the two Persons. <span class= "ital">Account the longsuffering of our Lord salvation</span> instead of accounting it to be "slackness" (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2Peter 3:9</a>); make use of it for working out your own salvation in fear and trembling, instead of criticising it. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation.</span> The apostle is referring to verse 9. Scoffers count the delay of the judgment slackness; the Christian should count it salvation; it is for the salvation of the elect that the judgment tarrieth. It is almost certain that by "our Lord" here St. Peter means the Lord Jesus, whom he describes by the same title in verse 18. Even as our beloved brother Paul also. The plural pronoun may be intended to imply that St. Paul was known to the Churches to which St. Peter was writing, and was beloved there. St. Peter addresses his readers as "beloved" four times in this Epistle; he here uses the same epithet of St. Paul. It comes naturally from his lips; but a writer of the second century would probably have used much stronger words of praise in speaking of one so much reverenced. According to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; rather, <span class="accented">wrote to you</span> (comp. Polycarp, 'Ad Philipp.,' 1:3, "One like me cannot equal the wisdom of the blessed Paul"). That wisdom was given mite him, as he himself says (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>). If we ask to what Epistles of St. Paul is St. Peter referring, the passage which at once occurs to us is <a href="/1_thessalonians/4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4</a> and 5. This Epistle was probably known to St. Peter; there may be a reference to <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a> in verse 10 of this chapter; and Silvanus, whose name St. Paul associates with his own in both Epistles to the Thessalonians, was with St. Peter when he wrote his First Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). But St. Peter's Second Epistle is addressed (primarily at least) to the same Churches to which the first was written (chapter 3:1). We must therefore either say, with Dean Alford, that "our Epistle belongs to a date when the Pauline Epistles were no longer the property only of the Churches to which they were written, but were dispersed through, and considered to belong to, the whole Christian Church;" or we must suppose that the passages in St. Peter's thoughts were not in the Epistle to the Thessalonians, but in some of the Epistles addressed to the Churches of Asia Minor; as, for instance, <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9-11</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 24</a>; or, possibly <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a> and Romans 9:22, as there seem to be some reasons for believing that this last Epistle was addressed to the Church at Ephesus among others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Consider also that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;geisthe)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Middle or Passive - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2233.htm">Strong's 2233: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) To lead, (b) To think, be of opinion, suppose, consider. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">our</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;m&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
