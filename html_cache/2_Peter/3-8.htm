This phrase serves as a reminder to the audience to pay close attention to the teachings being presented. The apostle Peter is addressing the early Christian community, urging them to remain vigilant and aware of the truths of their faith. This is a pastoral exhortation, emphasizing the importance of understanding and remembering key spiritual truths amidst false teachings and skepticism about the return of Christ.<p><b>With the Lord a day is like a thousand years,</b><br>This phrase reflects the divine perspective on time, contrasting it with human understanding. It echoes <a href="/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>, which states, "For a thousand years in Your sight are like a day that has just gone by." This comparison highlights God's eternal nature and His transcendence over time. It reassures believers that God's promises, including the return of Christ, are not delayed but are unfolding according to His perfect timing. This understanding is crucial for maintaining faith and patience, especially when facing doubts or persecution.<p><b>and a thousand years are like a day.</b><br>Reiterating the previous concept, this phrase emphasizes the fluidity and relativity of time from God's perspective. It serves as a reminder that God's plans and purposes are not bound by human timelines. This concept is significant in eschatological discussions, as it addresses concerns about the perceived delay in the fulfillment of prophecies regarding the end times. It encourages believers to trust in God's sovereignty and His ultimate control over history, reinforcing the idea that His timing is always perfect, even if it seems prolonged from a human viewpoint.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, writing to encourage and instruct believers in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to God, emphasizing His eternal nature and perspective on time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beloved.htm">Beloved</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, likely early Christians facing challenges and needing reassurance of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_eternal_perspective.htm">God's Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Understand that God's view of time is vastly different from ours.

This truth anchors our hope: the Lord&#8217;s promises are sure, His timing flawless, and His love for His people unwavering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_peter/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "ital">Second Answer</span> to the sceptical argument: Time is the condition of man's thought and action, but not of God's. His thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor His ways as our ways; what seems delay to us is none to Him.<p><span class= "bld">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing.</span>--Although these scoffers are willingly ignorant of what refutes their error, do not you be ignorant of what will lead you to the truth.<p><span class= "bld">One day is with the Lord as a thousand years.</span>--This half of the saying is quite original, and has no equivalent in <a href="/psalms/90-4.htm" title="For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.">Psalm 90:4</a>. The second half is only partially parallel to "a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday, when it is past." Consequently, we cannot be sure that the Apostle had this passage from the Psalms in his mind, though it is probable enough that he had. That God Can punish in one day the sins of a thousand years is a thought which is neither in the text nor in the context. What is insisted on is simply this--that distinctions of long and short time are nothing in the sight of God; delay is a purely human conception. Justin Martyr, about A.D. 145 (<span class= "ital">Trypho, </span>lxxxi.), gives "the day of the Lord is as a thousand years" as a quotation, and in this form it is closer to <a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8</a> than to <a href="/psalms/90-4.htm" title="For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.">Psalm 90:4</a>. As another possible reference to our Epistle follows in the next chapter, it may be regarded as not improbable that Justin knew the Epistle. (See above, second Note on <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>.) But the saying may have been a favourite one, especially with those who held Millenarian views. In the <span class= "ital">Epistle of Barnabas</span> (xv. 4) we read," For a day means with Him a thousand years, and He Himself witnesseth, saying, Behold, to-day shall be as a thousand years," where for "to-day" the <span class= "ital">Codex Sinaiticus</span> reads "the day of the Lord." Irenaeus has "The day of the Lord is as a thousand years" twice--(V. xxiii. 2; xxviii. 3); Hippolytus has it once (<span class= "ital">Comm. on Daniel, </span>Lagarde, p. 153); Methodius once (in Photius' <span class= "ital">Bibliotheca, </span>cod. 235). In no case, however, is the context at all similar to the verses before us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">let not this one thing escape you</span>, as especially important. <span class="cmt_word">That one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span> "With the Lord" means in his sight, in his estimate of things (comp. <a href="/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>, "A thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday"). Bengel finely says, "Dei aeoniologium (sic appellare liceat) differt ab horologic mortalium. Illius gnomon omnes homis simul indicat in summa actione et in summa quiete. Ei nec tardius nec celerius labuntur tempera quam ipsi et oeconomiae ejus aptum sit. Nulls causa est cur finem rerum aut protelare aut accelerare necessum habeat. Qui hoc comprehendemus? Si comprehendere possemus, non opus foret a Mose et Petro addi, apud Dominum." God is eternal: his thought is not, like ours, subject to the law of time; and even we can understand that one day, as the day of the Saviour's death, may have far more of intense action compressed into it, and far more influence upon the spiritual destiny of mankind, than any period of a thousand years. This passage seems to be quoted by Justin Martyr, the 'Epistle of Barnabas,' Irenaeus, and Hippolytus; but they may be referring to <a href="/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, though the quotations resemble the words of St. Peter more closely than those of the psalm. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/3-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Beloved,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(agap&#275;toi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_27.htm">Strong's 27: </a> </span><span class="str2">From agapao; beloved.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">{do} not {let}</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
