In the biblical context, some early Christians were concerned about the delay of the Second Coming. This echoes the Old Testament, where God's timing often differed from human expectations (e.g., <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>). The promise refers to the return of Christ and the establishment of His kingdom, a central hope in Christian eschatology.<p><b>as some understand slowness</b><br>Here, the text acknowledges human perceptions of time and impatience. In historical context, scoffers in Peter's time questioned the validity of the promise due to the delay (<a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3-4</a>). This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's ways and timing are beyond human comprehension (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>but is patient with you</b><br>God's patience is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting His mercy and desire for repentance (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>). This patience is not a sign of neglect but of divine love and forbearance. The historical context shows that God's patience was evident in the Old Testament, such as in the days of Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>).<p><b>not wanting anyone to perish</b><br>This phrase underscores God's desire for salvation rather than judgment. It aligns with the biblical teaching that God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (<a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23, 32</a>). Theologically, it emphasizes God's universal offer of salvation, though it does not imply universalism.<p><b>but everyone to come to repentance</b><br>Repentance is a key biblical concept, involving a change of mind and turning away from sin. This reflects the New Testament call to repentance as a response to the gospel (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>). The phrase highlights God's inclusive call to all humanity, consistent with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to God, emphasizing His sovereignty and divine nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who authored this epistle, addressing early Christians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christians.htm">Early Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, facing challenges and awaiting Christ's return.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promise.htm">Promise</a></b><br>Refers to the promise of Christ's return and the fulfillment of God's plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>A key theme in Christian doctrine, involving a change of mind and turning away from sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience.htm">God's Patience</a></b><br>God's delay is not a sign of forgetfulness but of His immense patience, giving humanity time to repent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_timing.htm">Understanding God's Timing</a></b><br>Human perception of time differs from God's eternal perspective.

By "is not slack is meant "does not delay beyond the time appointed." There is no dilatoriness; He waits, but is never slow, is never late.<p><span class= "bld">Concerning his promise.</span>--The Greek construction is peculiar, formed on the analogy of a comparative adjective--"is not slower than his promise." (Comp. <a href="/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But is longsuffering.</span>--(Comp. <a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm" title="And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;">2Peter 3:15</a> and <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm" title="Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.">1Peter 3:20</a>. As St. Augustine puts it, God is <span class= "ital">patiens quia aeternus</span>--longsuffering because He is eternal. He who is from everlasting to everlasting can afford to wait. (Comp. the <span class= "ital">Shepherd, Sim.</span> VIII. xi. 1.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness.</span> The Lord here, as frequently in these Epistles, is God the Father; it is he only who knoweth that day and that hour (<a href="/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>). Some take the genitive <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> with "the Lord," and translate, "The Lord of the promise is not slack." This is a possible connection, but, not so satisfactory as the ordinary rendering. (For the genitive with the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, see Winer, 3:30, 6, b.) The latter clause may be understood, "as some think it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the delay of the judgment, to be slackness;" or better, perhaps, "as some understand the meaning of slackness." Men are slow in fulfilling their promises from various, often selfish, motives; the Lord's delay comes from love and long-suffering. But is long-suffering to us-ward; rather, to <span class="accented">you-ward</span>, which seems to be the best-supported reading; two ancient manuscripts give "for your sake." St. Peter has the same thought in the First Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/4.htm">1 Peter 4</a>:20); there he reminds us how the long-suffering of God waited while the ark was a-preparing; here he tells us that the delay of the judgment, at which unbelievers scoff, is due to the same cause. We note here an item of evidence for the common authorship of the two Epistles (comp. <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, quoted in <a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>, and Ecclus. 32:22, in the Septuagint; also Augustine's well-known words, "Pattens quid aeternus"). <span class="cmt_word">Not willing that any should perish;</span> rather, <span class="accented">not wishing or desiring</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The participle gives the reason of the Lord's delay; he hath no pleasure that the wicked should die (<a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23, 32</a>, and Ezekiel 33:11). <span class="cmt_word">But that all should come to repentance.</span> The G reek word for "come" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), occurs in the same sense in <a href="/matthew/15-17.htm">Matthew 15:17</a> (see also the remarkable parallel from Plutarch, 'De Flum.,' page 19 (quoted by Alford), <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Calvin takes it transitively, "willing to <span class="accented">receive</span> all to repentance." But the common translation is plainly right (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a> combined with <a href="/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/3-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The Lord</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Kyrios)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2962.htm">Strong's 2962: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lord, master, sir; the Lord.
