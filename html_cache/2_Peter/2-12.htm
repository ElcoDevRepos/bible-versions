In biblical context, animals often symbolize those who act on base instincts rather than divine wisdom (<a href="/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a>). The comparison highlights the danger of living without the guidance of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5-8</a>, where living according to the flesh is contrasted with living according to the Spirit.<p><b>creatures of instinct</b><br>The term "creatures of instinct" suggests behavior driven by natural impulses rather than conscious thought or moral consideration. This reflects the biblical theme of the fallen nature of humanity, as seen in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where human wickedness is described as pervasive. The instinctual behavior of these false teachers is contrasted with the call to live by the Spirit, as in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>.<p><b>born to be captured and destroyed</b><br>This phrase indicates the inevitable judgment awaiting those who persist in false teaching and rebellion against God. The imagery of capture and destruction is reminiscent of the fate of the wicked in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-19</a>, where the wicked are set on slippery ground and ultimately destroyed. It underscores the certainty of divine justice.<p><b>They blaspheme in matters they do not understand</b><br>Blasphemy here refers to speaking irreverently about sacred things, showing a profound lack of understanding and respect for divine truths. This echoes <a href="/jude/1-10.htm">Jude 1:10</a>, where similar language is used to describe those who slander what they do not comprehend. The warning against blasphemy is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, which emphasizes the importance of reverence for God and His Word (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>).<p><b>and like such creatures, they too will be destroyed</b><br>The repetition of the theme of destruction reinforces the certainty of judgment for those who reject God's truth. This mirrors the fate of the ungodly described in <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>, where they will face eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord.

This verse appears to tell strongly in favour of the priority of our Epistle. The literary form of <a href="/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>, is so very superior; the antithesis (quite wanting here) between abusing what they cannot know and misusing what they cannot help knowing is so telling, and would be so easily remembered, that it is improbable that a writer who was willing to adopt so much would not have adopted in this respect also; and whichever writer is second, it is evident that he was willing to adopt his predecessor's material almost to any extent. On the other hand, there is nothing improbable in a writer who knew this verse improving upon it by writing <a href="/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>. The verses, similar as they are in much of their wording, are very different in their general drift. <a href="/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>, is simply an epigrammatic description of these ungodly men; this verse is a denunciation of final ruin against them.<p><span class= "bld">Made to be taken and destroyed.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">born naturally for capture and destruction. "</span>Natural" comes in better here as a kind of adverb than as an additional epithet to beasts. The force of it is that these animals cannot help themselves--it is their nature to rush after what will prove their ruin; but the false teachers voluntarily seek their own destruction against nature. This verse contains one of the repetitions noticed above (see on <a href="/2_peter/2-7.htm" title="And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:">2Peter 2:7</a>) as characteristic of this Epistle. The word for "destruction" and "corruption" is one and the same in the Greek, the destroying being literal in the first case, moral in the second. Moreover, the word for "perish" is from the same root. "Like brutes born for capture and <span class= "ital">destruction, </span>these men shall be <span class= "ital">destroyed</span> in their <span class= "ital">destruction.</span>" But such a translation would be misleading in English.<p><span class= "bld">Shall utterly perish.</span>--A reading of higher authority gives us, <span class= "ital">shall even perish.</span><p><span class= "bld">In their own corruption.</span>--"Own" may be omitted. Their present evil life anticipates and contains within itself the elements of their final destruction. Thus they "bring it upon themselves" (<a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>). The right division of the sentences here cannot be decided with certainty; the Apostle hurries on, in the full flood of his denunciation, without paying much attention to the precise form of his language. On the whole, it seems best to place only a comma at the end of <a href="/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2Peter 2:12</a>, with a full stop or colon at "unrighteousness," and to make what follows part of the long sentence, of which the main verb is "are gone astray" in <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2Peter 2:15</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed.</span> The order of the words in the best manuscripts favours the translation of the Revised Version, <span class="accented">But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed.</span> The word rendered "mere animals" is literally "natural" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;</span>); comp. <a href="/jude/1-10.htm">Jude 1:10</a>, "what they know naturally (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) as brute beasts."
