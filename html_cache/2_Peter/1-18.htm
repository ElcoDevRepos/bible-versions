The voice from heaven is identified as the voice of God the Father, affirming Jesus as His beloved Son. This divine affirmation is crucial as it confirms Jesus' identity and mission. The concept of a voice from heaven is consistent with other biblical instances where God communicates directly, such as during Jesus' baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>) and Saul's conversion (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-6</a>). The phrase underscores the reliability of the apostolic witness, as they were not relaying secondhand information but were direct recipients of divine revelation.<p><b>when we were with Him on the holy mountain</b><br>The "holy mountain" refers to the Mount of Transfiguration, traditionally identified as Mount Tabor, although some scholars suggest Mount Hermon due to its proximity to Caesarea Philippi, where the preceding events took place. The designation of the mountain as "holy" highlights its significance as a place of divine encounter, paralleling other biblical mountains like Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Law (Exodus 19), and Mount Zion, the site of the Temple in Jerusalem. The Transfiguration event itself is a pivotal moment in the Gospels, where Jesus' divine glory is revealed to the apostles, prefiguring His resurrection and second coming. This moment also connects to Old Testament theophanies, where God's presence is manifested in a tangible way, reinforcing the continuity of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples and the author of this epistle.

Rather, it indicates a view many centuries older than the Evangelists--that wherever God had specially manifested Himself was "holy ground" (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm" title="And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place where on you stand is holy ground.">Exodus 3:5</a>; Josh.

Mount Horeb was "holy ground," because God appeared there to Moses, because it was the scene of the giving of the Law. Mount Zion was a holy hill, because God had chosen it to be a habitation for himself; the Mount of the Transfiguration was holy, because there God the Son manifested forth his glory. God hallows every place which he pleases to make the scene of his revealed presence.
