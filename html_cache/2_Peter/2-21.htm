The "way of righteousness" refers to the path of living according to God's standards, as revealed through Jesus Christ. In the biblical context, this echoes the warnings found in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6 and 10</a>:26-27, where the dangers of apostasy are highlighted. The idea is that greater knowledge brings greater responsibility, and turning away after knowing the truth results in a more severe judgment. This reflects the principle found in <a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47-48</a>, where Jesus teaches that those who know their master's will and fail to do it will receive a harsher punishment.<p><b>than to have known it and then to turn away</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the gravity of apostasy, which is the act of abandoning one's faith. Historically, the early church faced challenges from false teachers and those who fell away, as seen in the context of 2 Peter. The act of turning away is not merely a passive drifting but an active rejection of the truth once embraced. This is reminiscent of the Israelites in the Old Testament, who, despite witnessing God's miracles, often turned away from Him, leading to their downfall (e.g., <a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>).<p><b>from the holy commandment passed on to them</b><br>The "holy commandment" likely refers to the core teachings of the Christian faith, including the call to live a life of holiness and obedience to God. This commandment is rooted in the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>, where Jesus summarizes the law as loving God and neighbor. The phrase "passed on to them" indicates the transmission of apostolic teaching, which was a critical aspect of the early church's mission. This reflects the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus instructs His disciples to teach others to obey everything He commanded. The failure to adhere to these teachings after having received them is seen as a serious breach of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, addressing the early Christian communities and warning them about false teachers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals within the early church who were leading believers astray with heretical teachings and immoral behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in the first century who were recipients of Peter's letters, facing challenges from both external persecution and internal false teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_way_of_righteousness.htm">The Way of Righteousness</a></b><br>Refers to the Christian faith and the teachings of Jesus Christ, which lead to a righteous life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_commandment.htm">The Holy Commandment</a></b><br>The teachings and commandments of Jesus Christ, which were passed down to the believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_apostasy.htm">The Seriousness of Apostasy</a></b><br>Turning away from the faith after knowing the truth is a grave matter.
