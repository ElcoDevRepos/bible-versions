In the context of 2 Peter, this divine power is a reminder of God's sovereignty and omnipotence. The power of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, seen in creation (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>), the resurrection of Christ (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>), and the believer's transformation (<a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>).<p><b>has given us everything we need</b><br>This indicates the completeness and sufficiency of what God provides. The Greek word for "given" suggests a generous and gracious bestowal. This provision is comprehensive, covering all aspects of spiritual life. It echoes <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, where God supplies all needs according to His riches in glory.<p><b>for life and godliness</b><br>"Life" refers to both physical and spiritual life, while "godliness" pertains to living a life that reflects God's character. This dual focus underscores the holistic nature of God's provision. The call to godliness is a central theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>, which highlights the value of godliness in all things.<p><b>through the knowledge of Him</b><br>Knowledge here is not merely intellectual but relational and experiential. It involves a deep, personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. This knowledge is transformative, as seen in <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, where eternal life is defined as knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ.<p><b>who called us</b><br>The concept of calling is significant in Scripture, indicating God's initiative in salvation. This calling is effectual, meaning it accomplishes what God intends. <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a> speaks of those whom God predestined, He also called, justifying and glorifying them.<p><b>by His own glory and excellence</b><br>God's glory refers to His majestic presence and divine nature, while excellence denotes moral virtue and perfection. This phrase highlights the character of God as the basis for His calling. The glory of God is a theme throughout the Bible, from the Old Testament manifestations (<a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a>) to the revelation of Christ's glory (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his close relationship with Jesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_power.htm">Divine Power</a></b><br>Refers to God's omnipotent nature, which is the source of all spiritual and physical provision for believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/knowledge_of_him.htm">Knowledge of Him</a></b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of knowing God personally and intimately, which is central to the Christian faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/glory_and_excellence.htm">Glory and Excellence</a></b><br>Attributes of God that reflect His perfect nature and moral purity, which are the basis for His calling of believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of God's provision, called to live a life of godliness through the resources provided by His divine power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>Recognize that God has already provided everything necessary for living a godly life.

Galatians is the only exception; there a relative clause is added to the blessing; but this is solemnly brought to a close with a doxology, so that the exception is one that almost proves the rule.

It belongs to the phraseology of the later books of the New Testament. "Godliness" is the realisation of God's abiding presence, the fruits of which are reverence and trust: "Thou God seest me;" "I have set God always before me, therefore I cannot fall."

"God hath given us all things for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) life," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, all things necessary for life. By "life" St. Peter means the spiritual life of the soul; that life which consists in union with Christ, which is the life of Christ living in us. "Godliness" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is a word of the later apostolic age; besides this Epistle (in which it occurs four times) and a speech of St. Peter's in <a href="/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>, it is found only in St. Paul's pastoral Epistles; it means reverence, true piety towards God. Through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue; literally, <span class="accented">through the full knowledge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">of him that called us</span> (comp. <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God. and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent"). The best-supported reading seems to be that followed by the Revised Version, "By his own glory and virtue (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>)<span class="accented">."</span> Bengel says, "Ad gloriam referuntur attributa Dei naturalia, ad virtutem ea quae dicuntur moralia; intime unum sunt utraque." All his glorious attributes make up his glory; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, virtue, is the energy, the activity of those attributes. The other reading, also well supported (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "through glory and virtue"), would mean nearly the same (comp. <a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). God calls us through his attributes; his glorious perfections invite us, the revelation of those perfections calls us to his service. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>, with one exception (<a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>), occurs in the New Testament only in St. Peter's Epistles (see <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a> and 5). This <span class="accented">is</span>, so far, an argument in favour of identity of authorship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
