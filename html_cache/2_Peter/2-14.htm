In biblical context, "eyes" often symbolize one's focus or intent (<a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>). Adultery here is not only physical but also spiritual, representing unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>). The imagery suggests a constant, consuming desire for sinful pleasure, reflecting the state of those who have turned away from righteousness.<p><b>their desire for sin is never satisfied;</b><br>This highlights the insatiable nature of sin. <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a> states, "Death and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are human eyes." This reflects the biblical understanding that sin creates a void that cannot be filled, leading to a perpetual cycle of desire and dissatisfaction. It underscores the futility of seeking fulfillment outside of God's will.<p><b>they seduce the unstable.</b><br>The term "unstable" refers to those who are not firmly grounded in their faith (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>). These individuals are easily led astray by false teachings and immoral influences. The seduction implies a deliberate and malicious intent to lead others into sin, echoing the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>They are accursed children</b><br>This phrase indicates a state of being under divine judgment. "Accursed" suggests a separation from God's blessing, akin to the curse pronounced upon those who do not uphold the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>). The term "children" may imply a familial relationship with sin, as opposed to being children of God (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p><b>with hearts trained in greed.</b><br>The imagery of training suggests a deliberate and disciplined pursuit of selfish gain. This echoes the warnings against greed found throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). The heart, often seen as the seat of will and emotion, is depicted as being corrupted by a focus on material wealth and personal gain, contrasting with the call to store up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, addressing the early Christian communities and warning them about false teachers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals within the early church who were leading believers astray with heretical teachings and immoral behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, who were facing challenges from within due to the influence of false teachers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/accursed_children.htm">Accursed Children</a></b><br>A term used by Peter to describe the false teachers, indicating their separation from God's blessing due to their sinful actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unstable.htm">The Unstable</a></b><br>Refers to those in the community who are easily swayed or lacking in firm faith, making them susceptible to deception.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_against_deception.htm">Guard Against Deception</a></b><br>Be vigilant in discerning truth from falsehood, especially within the church.

Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>, this clause throws some light on it. In any case, the metaphor from fishing, twice in this Epistle and only once elsewhere, may point to a fisherman of Galilee. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/17-27.htm" title="Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go you to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first comes up; and when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a piece of money: that take, and give to them for me and you.">Matthew 17:27</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin;</span> literally, <span class="accented">of an adulteress.</span> Compare our Lord's words in the sermon on the mount (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>), which may have been in St. Peter's thoughts.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>, a bait, belongs to the art of the fowler or fisherman, and would naturally occur to St. Peter's mind. He uses it again in verse 18 of this chapter (comp. also <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a>). The word for "unstable" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs only here and in <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16</a>. It is a word of peculiar significance in the mouth of St. Peter, conscious, as he must have been, of his own want of stability in times past. He would remember also the charge once given to him, "When thou art converted, strengthen (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) thy brethren" (<a href="/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An heart they have exercised with covetous practices;</span> rather, <span class="accented">trained in covetousness</span>, according to the reading of the best manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. This is the third vice laid to the charge of the false teachers. They had practiced it so long that their very heart was trained in the habitual pursuit of gain by all unrighteous means.
