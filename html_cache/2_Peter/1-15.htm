The Greek word for "effort" suggests a zealous and earnest endeavor. Peter is emphasizing the importance of his mission to remind believers of the truths of the faith. This reflects the biblical principle of perseverance in teaching and discipleship, as seen in Paul's exhortation to Timothy to "preach the word" (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><b>to ensure that after my departure</b><br>"Departure" here refers to Peter's impending death. The term used can also mean "exodus," which connects to the idea of leaving this world for the next, similar to how Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt. Peter is aware of his mortality, echoing Jesus' prediction of his death (<a href="/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18-19</a>). This awareness drives his urgency to leave a lasting legacy of faith.<p><b>you will be able to recall these things</b><br>Peter's concern is for the believers to remember the teachings of Christ and the apostolic doctrine. This aligns with the Jewish tradition of oral and written transmission of teachings, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to remember God's commandments. The emphasis on memory underscores the importance of scripture and tradition in maintaining faith.<p><b>at all times</b><br>The phrase suggests a continuous and enduring remembrance. This is not just a call for occasional reflection but a constant awareness and application of the teachings. It reflects the biblical theme of meditating on God's word "day and night" (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>).

He is not merely sharing ideas; he is establishing something solid that cannot be shaken (cf. <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>, &#8220;stand firm and hold to the traditions we passed on to you&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Like Moses writing the law before he died (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>), Peter is preparing a trustworthy record&#8212;this very letter&#8212;to guard believers from error.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that after my departure</b><p>&#8220;Departure&#8221; points to Peter&#8217;s forthcoming death, already foretold by Jesus (<a href="/2_peter/1-14.htm">2 Peter 1:14</a>; <a href="/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18-19</a>). He views death as an exodus, the same word used of Christ&#8217;s &#8220;departure&#8221; in <a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>.<p>&#8226; Paul spoke similarly when he wrote, &#8220;The time of my departure is at hand&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>).

"Always" (or better, <span class= "ital">at all times</span>) belongs to "may be able," not to "have in remembrance;" and perhaps "moreover" is not quite right. Better, <span class= "ital">But I will endeavour that ye</span> <span class= "ital">may at all times also</span> (as well as now) <span class= "ital">have it in your power after my decease to remember these things.</span> To what does this declaration point? The simplest answer is, to his writing this letter, which they might keep and read whenever they liked. (Comp. <a href="/2_peter/1-13.htm" title="Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;">2Peter 1:13</a>.) Other suggestions are--to his having copies of this letter distributed; or, writing other letters; or, instructing, St. Mark to write his Gospel; or, commissioning "faithful men" to teach these things. There seems to be nothing either for or against these conjectures. It is a coincidence worth noting that, with the Transfiguration in his mind (<a href="/context/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16-18</a>), he uses, in close succession, two words connected in St. Luke's account of the Transfiguration (<a href="/luke/9-31.htm" title="Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.">Luke 9:31</a>; <a href="/luke/9-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.">Luke 9:33</a>)--"decease" and "tabernacle."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but I will also give diligence that ye may be able at every time after my decease to call these things to remembrance.</span> Of the two particles used here the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> connects this verso with verse 13; the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> implies a further resolve. St. Peter will not only stir up the minds of his readers during his life, but he will give diligence to enable them to call to remembrance, after his death, the truths which he had preached. These words may refer simply to the present Epistle; but it seems more natural to understand them of an intention to commit to writing the facts of the gospel history; if this be so, we have here a confirmation of the ancient tradition that the Second Gospel was written by St. Mark at the dictation of St. Peter. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is that used in verse 10, and should be translated in the same way; they must give diligence to make their calling and election sure. St. Peter, for his part, will give diligence to furnish them with a lasting record of the truths of Christianity. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, at every time, whenever there may be need, occurs only here in the New Testament. (For <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "to be able," compare the Greek of <a href="/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>.) It is remarkable that we have here, in two consecutive verses, two words which remind us of the history of the Transfiguration, "tabernacle," and "decease" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; see <a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>). Then Peter proposed to make three tabernacles; then he heard Moses and Elijah speaking of the Lord's decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. The simple unconscious occurrence of these coincidences is a strong proof of the genuineness of our Epistle; it is inconceivable that an imitator of the second century should have shown this delicate skill in adapting his production to the circumstances of the supposed writer. The last words of the verse may mean (and in classical Greek would mean) "to make mention of these things;" but the usual rendering seems more suitable here. St. Peter was anxious rather that his readers should have the truths of the gospel living in their memories, than that they should talk about them; that would follow as a matter of course: "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Some Roman Catholic commentators think that this passage contains a promise that the apostle would still, after his death, continue to remember the needs of the Church on earth, and to help them by his intercessions; but this interpretation involves a complete dislocation of clauses, and cannot possibly be the true meaning of the words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will make every effort to ensure</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(spoudas&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4704.htm">Strong's 4704: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hasten, be eager, be zealous.
