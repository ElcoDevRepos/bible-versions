The concept of "wages" echoes <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, which states, "For the wages of sin is death." This suggests a direct correlation between sin and its consequences. The idea of suffering harm as a result of wickedness is consistent with the biblical theme of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>. The term "wickedness" here refers to moral corruption and rebellion against God's laws, which is a recurring theme in both the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>They consider it a pleasure to carouse in broad daylight.</b><br>This phrase indicates a brazen and shameless attitude towards sin. In the cultural context of the first century, carousing or engaging in revelry was typically associated with nighttime activities, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>, which contrasts those who are "of the day" with those who engage in drunkenness at night. The fact that these individuals take pleasure in such behavior during the day suggests a complete disregard for societal norms and a hardened conscience. This behavior is indicative of a deeper spiritual blindness and moral decay.<p><b>They are blots and blemishes,</b><br>The imagery of "blots and blemishes" conveys the idea of impurity and defilement. In the Old Testament, sacrifices offered to God were required to be without blemish (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>), symbolizing purity and holiness. By contrast, these individuals are described as moral and spiritual stains within the community. This language underscores the corrupting influence they have on the church, as they stand in stark contrast to the call for believers to be holy and blameless (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>).<p><b>reveling in their deception as they feast with you.</b><br>This phrase suggests that these individuals are not only engaging in deceitful practices but are also taking pleasure in them. The act of feasting together implies a level of fellowship and intimacy within the Christian community. However, their presence at these gatherings is marked by hypocrisy and deceit, reminiscent of <a href="/jude/1-12.htm">Jude 1:12</a>, which describes similar individuals as "blemishes at your love feasts." This highlights the danger of false teachers and the need for discernment within the church. The reference to feasting may also allude to the early Christian practice of the agape feast, a communal meal that often accompanied the Lord's Supper, emphasizing the gravity of their deception in a sacred context.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, addressing the early Christian communities and warning them against false teachers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals within the early church who were leading believers astray with deceptive teachings and immoral behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, who were facing challenges from within due to the influence of false teachers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feasts.htm">Feasts</a></b><br>Likely referring to communal meals or love feasts (agape feasts) where believers gathered, and where these false teachers were present.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/daylight_carousing.htm">Daylight Carousing</a></b><br>A reference to the shameless and public nature of the false teachers' sinful behavior.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_wickedness.htm">The Consequences of Wickedness</a></b><br>Sin has tangible consequences, both in this life and the next.

This reading is adopted by the Revised Version in the translation, "suffering wrong as the hire of wrongdoing." But the other reading is well supported, and gives a better sense, "receiving, as they shall, the reward of unrighteousness." Balaam loved the reward of unrighteousness in this world (verse 15); the false teachers shall receive its final reward in the world to come. Whichever reading is preferred, this clause is best taken with the preceding verse. As they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime; literally, <span class="accented">counting the revel in daytime a pleasure.</span> St. Peter has hitherto spoken of the insubordination and irreverence of the false teachers; he now goes on to condemn their sensuality. The words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> cannot, with some ancient interpreters, be taken as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, daily (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>). Many commentators, as Huther and Alford, translate "delicate living for a day" - enjoyment which is temporal and short-lived. But when we compare <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>, "They that are drunken are drunken in the night," and St. Peter's own words in <a href="/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>, it seems more probable that the apostle means to describe these false teachers as worse than ordinary men of pleasure. They reserve the night for their feasting; these men spend the day in luxury. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> means "luxurious or delicate living" rather than "riot." Spots they are and blemishes. (For <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, spots, St. Jude has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, sunken rocks.) The word for <span class="accented">"blemishes"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. But comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, where the Lord Jesus is described as "a Lamb without blemish and without spot (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." The Church should be like her Lord, "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing" (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>); but these men are spots and blemishes on her beauty. <span class="cmt_word">Sporting themselves with their own deceivings;</span> literally, <span class="accented">reveling in their deceivings.</span> The word for "reveling" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, used just above. The manuscripts vary between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, deceivings, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, loves, love-feasts. The former reading seems the best-supported here, and the latter in the parallel passage of St. Jude (verse 12). It is possible that the paronomasia may be intentional (compare the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of St. Peter and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Jude). St. Peter will not use the honourable name for the banquets which these men disgrace by their excesses. He calls them <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> - deceits, not love-feasts. There is no love in the hearts of these men. Their love-feasts are hypocrisies, deceits; they try to deceive men, but they deceive not God. <span class="cmt_word">While they feast with you.</span> The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/jude/1-12.htm">Jude 1:12</a>. The false teachers joined in the love-feasts, but made them the occasion of self-indulgence. Compare the similar conduct of the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20-22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The harm they will suffer</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(adikoumenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_91.htm">Strong's 91: </a> </span><span class="str2">To act unjustly towards, injure, harm.
