Proverbs, often used in biblical literature, convey wisdom through concise and memorable sayings. Here, Peter references well-known proverbs to emphasize the nature of false teachers and those who fall away from the faith. The use of proverbs in Jewish culture was a common method to impart moral lessons, and Peter's audience would have been familiar with this teaching style.<p><b>&#8220;A dog returns to its vomit,&#8221;</b><br>This proverb is a direct quotation from <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>, which highlights the foolishness of repeating one's mistakes. In the ancient Near East, dogs were not the beloved pets they are today but were often seen as unclean scavengers. This imagery underscores the repulsive nature of returning to sinful behaviors after having known the truth of the Gospel. The proverb serves as a warning against apostasy and the dangers of reverting to a sinful lifestyle after experiencing the cleansing power of Christ.<p><b>and, &#8220;A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud.&#8221;</b><br>The image of a washed sow returning to the mud further illustrates the futility of external cleansing without internal transformation. In Jewish culture, pigs were considered unclean animals, and the act of washing a pig only for it to return to the mud highlights the superficiality of outward change without genuine repentance. This reflects the broader biblical theme that true conversion involves a change of heart, not just behavior. The imagery serves as a caution against superficial faith and underscores the necessity of a deep, transformative relationship with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, addressing false teachers and the dangers they pose to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals within the early church who were leading others astray with heretical teachings and immoral behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/proverbs.htm">Proverbs</a></b><br>The sayings referenced by Peter, which are drawn from Jewish wisdom literature and common cultural proverbs of the time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dogs_and_sows.htm">Dogs and Sows</a></b><br>Animals used metaphorically to illustrate the nature of those who return to sinful behaviors after having known the truth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, who were being warned against the influence of false teachers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_apostasy.htm">The Danger of Apostasy</a></b><br>Apostasy, or falling away from the faith, is a serious danger.

He is exposing the futility of external religion that never results in a new heart (<a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4&#8211;6</a>; 10:26&#8211;29).<p>&#8226; Just as water cannot alter a pig&#8217;s nature, religious polish cannot transform a sinner&#8217;s heart. Only genuine repentance and faith in Christ create real change (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>).<p>&#8226; When professing believers revert to habitual, unrepentant sin, they reveal that their nature was never truly changed (<a href="/matthew/13-20.htm">Matthew 13:20&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a> uses two vivid proverbs to illustrate the tragedy of false teachers and superficial converts. Like dogs and pigs, they may appear momentarily improved, yet their unchanged nature draws them back to defilement. Peter&#8217;s point is not loss of genuine salvation but exposure of counterfeit faith. Authentic conversion produces a new heart that resists returning to sin; mere external reform does not. Therefore, heed the warning: pursue the new birth that only Christ provides and continue walking in the holiness that proves His life within you.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_peter/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb.</span>--More literally, <span class= "ital">There has happened to them what the true proverb says; "</span>but<span class= "ital">"</span> is of very doubtful authority. The word for "proverb" is the one used elsewhere only by St. John in his Gospel, and there translated once "parable" and thrice "proverb." "Parable," or "allegory," would have been best in all four cases (<a href="/john/10-6.htm" title="This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them.">John 10:6</a>, where see Note; <a href="/john/16-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.">John 16:25</a>; <a href="/john/16-29.htm" title="His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.">John 16:29</a>). The first proverb is found, <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm" title="As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.">Proverbs 26:11</a>, and if that be the source of the quotation, we have here an independent translation of the Hebrew, for the LXX. gives an entirely different rendering, "dog" being the only word in common to the two Greek versions. The word for "vomit" here is possibly formed by the writer himself; that for "wallowing" is also a rare word. The LXX. adds, "and becomes abominable," which has no equivalent in the existing Hebrew text; and it has been suggested that these words may misrepresent the Hebrew original of the second proverb here. But it is quite possible that both proverbs come from popular tradition, and not from Scripture at all. If, however, the Book of Proverbs be the source of the quotation, it is worth while noting that no less than four times in as many chapters does St. Peter recall passages from the Proverbs in the First Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-8.htm" title="And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.">1Peter 4:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-18.htm" title="And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?">1Peter 4:18</a>). In the Greek neither proverb has a verb, as so often in such sayings--<span class= "ital">a dog that has returned to his own vomit; a washed sow to wallowing in the mire;</span> just as we say "the dog in the manger," "a fool and his money." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb.</span> The conjunction "but" is omitted in the best manuscripts.

St. Peter may be quoting <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>; but his words are very different from the Septuagint Version of that passage; perhaps it is more probable that the expression had become proverbial, and that the apostle is referring to a form of it in common use with his readers; like that which follows, which is not in the Book of Proverbs. <span class="cmt_word">And the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the sow that had washed to her wallowing</span>; or, according to some ancient manuscripts, "her wallowing-place."
