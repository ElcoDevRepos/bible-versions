In the context of false teachers, greed indicates a self-serving motive that contrasts with the selflessness expected of true spiritual leaders (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>). The love of money is described as a root of all kinds of evil (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>), and here it drives the false teachers to exploit others.<p><b>these false teachers</b><br>False teachers are a significant concern in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> and <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a>. They often arise from within the church, distorting the truth for personal gain. The early church faced numerous heresies, such as Gnosticism, which denied the humanity of Christ and promoted secret knowledge. These teachers are contrasted with true apostles who faithfully transmit the teachings of Jesus.<p><b>will exploit you with deceptive words.</b><br>Exploitation through deception is a hallmark of false teaching. The Greek term for "exploit" suggests making merchandise of believers, treating them as commodities rather than souls. Deceptive words are crafted to sound plausible, often mixing truth with error, as seen in Satan's temptation of Eve (<a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>). Believers are warned to test the spirits and hold fast to sound doctrine (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p><b>The longstanding verdict against them remains in force,</b><br>The "longstanding verdict" implies a divine judgment that has been established from ancient times. This echoes <a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>, where certain individuals are marked out for condemnation. The Old Testament provides examples of God's judgment on false prophets, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14-15</a>. God's justice is portrayed as unwavering and certain, reinforcing the idea that false teachers will not escape accountability.<p><b>and their destruction does not sleep.</b><br>The imagery of destruction not sleeping suggests an inevitable and active process of divine retribution. This aligns with the biblical principle that God is not slow in keeping His promises, including those of judgment (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). The phrase may also evoke the relentless nature of God's justice, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>), serving as a warning to those who pervert the truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, addressing the early Christian communities and warning them about false teachers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals within the early church who spread heretical teachings and exploit believers for personal gain.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, who were facing challenges from within due to false teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The divine verdict against false teachers, emphasizing that their destruction is certain and imminent.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/greed_and_deception.htm">Greed and Deception</a></b><br>The motivations and methods of the false teachers, highlighting their moral corruption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_is_essential.htm">Discernment is Essential</a></b><br>Believers must be vigilant and discerning to identify and resist false teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_greed.htm">The Danger of Greed</a></b><br>Greed can lead to exploitation and deception, both in the church and in personal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_is_certain.htm">God's Justice is Certain</a></b><br>Despite the apparent success of false teachers, God's judgment is assured and will be executed in His timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Deceptive words can lead believers astray; therefore, grounding in Scripture is crucial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_accountability.htm">Community Accountability</a></b><br>The church community should hold each other accountable to prevent the spread of false teachings.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Peter_2_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Peter 2:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Spotting_false_teachings_today_6.htm">How can we identify "false words" in teachings today, as warned in 2 Peter 2:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Implication_of_God_s_justice.htm">What does "their destruction has not been sleeping" imply about God's justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/2_Peter_2_3_vs_Matthew_7_15_warnings.htm">How does 2 Peter 2:3 relate to warnings about false prophets in Matthew 7:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_exploitation_by_false_teachers.htm">In what ways can we guard against being exploited by false teachers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_2_Peter_2_3_on_spiritual_discernment.htm">How should the warning in 2 Peter 2:3 influence our discernment in spiritual matters?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Peter_2_3_on_today_s_false_prophets.htm">How does 2 Peter 2:3 address the issue of false prophets in the church today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Peter_2_3_on_God_s_judgment_of_false_teachers.htm">What does 2 Peter 2:3 reveal about God's judgment on false teachers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Greed_s_link_to_2_Peter_2_3_message.htm">How does greed relate to the message in 2 Peter 2:3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_peter_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Peter 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_can_you_identify_false_prophets.htm">How can you identify false prophets?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_abuse_and_guilt.htm">What does the Bible say about abuse and guilt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_false_apostles.htm">What does the Bible say about false apostles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/2_peter_3_7__fiery_end_vs._cosmology.htm">2 Peter 3:7: Does the idea of a future fiery destruction conflict with modern cosmology?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 2 Peter 2:3 Mean</div><b>In their greed</b><p>Greed drives the false teachers Peter warns about. Instead of shepherding God&#8217;s flock out of love (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>), they use ministry as a revenue stream. Scripture consistently links greed with spiritual ruin: &#8220;Those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a trap&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>). Jesus cautioned that we cannot serve both God and money (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>), and Paul exposed teachers who &#8220;peddle the word of God for profit&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>). Greed is not merely a character flaw; it is a heart&#8211;level idolatry that makes room for every other deception.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These false teachers will exploit you with deceptive words</b><p>Once greed takes root, manipulation follows. Peter says they will &#8220;exploit&#8221; believers&#8212;treating people as means to an end. Consider how:<p>&#8226; They distort Scripture&#8212;twisting texts &#8220;to their own destruction&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; They appeal to fleshly desires (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; They use smooth talk and flattery to &#8220;deceive the hearts of the naive&#8221; (<a href="/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; They mimic truth closely enough to pass a quick glance (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>).<p>The danger is subtle: a half-truth dressed in biblical language can sound convincing. <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a> pictures wolves rising &#8220;from among your own number,&#8221; underscoring that proximity to church life does not guarantee purity of doctrine.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The longstanding verdict against them remains in force</b><p>God&#8217;s judgment is not a new idea suddenly dropped on these teachers; it is an established decree. Jude 4 echoes the same verdict: &#8220;Condemnation was written about long ago.&#8221; From the flood (<a href="/bsb/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-7</a>) to Sodom (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>), God has demonstrated that He will not allow unchecked rebellion. <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2-3</a> warns that every transgression received a just penalty, so ignoring the gospel invites certain judgment. The sentence is already on the books; only the timing of its execution awaits.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their destruction does not sleep</b><p>Though God may appear patient, His justice is never idle. &#8220;The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). Judgment is wide-awake, poised to act. <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-20</a> depicts the sudden ruin of the wicked&#8212;one moment secure, the next swept away. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a> reminds us that delayed justice emboldens wrongdoing, yet <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a> assures that the Lord &#8220;will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.&#8221; Ultimately, <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6-9</a> describes everlasting destruction for those who refuse the truth, a certainty sealed in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a> exposes a sobering progression: greed breeds deception, deception leads to exploitation, and exploitation invites inevitable judgment. False teachers may prosper for a season, but God&#8217;s verdict stands, ever vigilant. For believers, the call is to recognize greed-driven teaching, cling to sound doctrine, and trust that God&#8217;s justice&#8212;though sometimes delayed&#8212;never sleeps.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_peter/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And through covetousness.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">In covetousness.</span> This is the atmosphere in which they live.

Simon Magus, the first heresiarch, sought to trade in holy things; the like sin seems to have been characteristic of the false teachers of apostolic times. The word translated "feigned" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; the words of these men were not the expression of their real thoughts and feelings; they were invented, craftily contrived to deceive men, and that for the sake of money. The last words of the clause will admit another sense: "shall gain you," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "shall gain you over to their party;" and this view derives some support from the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the Septuagint Version of <a href="/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>. But the verb is often used in classical writers in the sense of making a profit out of people or things, and this meaning seems most suitable here. The false teachers will work hard, as the Pharisees did, to make proselytes; but their real motive <span class="accented">is</span>, not the salvation of souls, but their own selfish gain. <span class="cmt_word">Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for whom the sentence of a long time idleth not.</span> The sentence of judgment is for them, for their condemnation; in the foreknowledge of God it has been pronounced long ago, and ever since it has been drawing near; it doth not tarry (comp. <a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a> and <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). The word rendered "of a long time" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) occurs only here and <a href="/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And their damnation slumbereth not;</span> <span class="accented">destruction:</span> it is the word which has been used already twice in verse 1. The verb means literally "to nod," then "to slumber;" it is found elsewhere in the New Testament only in the parable of the virgins (<a href="/matthew/25-5.htm">Matthew 25:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
