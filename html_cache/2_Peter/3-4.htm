The promise of His coming refers to the Second Coming of Christ, a future event prophesied in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>). The question posed by scoffers highlights a common challenge faced by early Christians: maintaining faith in the face of delay and opposition. This skepticism is not new; it echoes the disbelief encountered by Noah before the flood (Genesis 6-7) and the Israelites' doubt in the wilderness (Exodus 32). The phrase underscores the tension between divine promises and human impatience.<p><b>&#8220;Ever since our fathers fell asleep,&#8221;</b><br>The term "fathers" likely refers to the patriarchs or the early generations of believers, including the apostles and early church leaders. "Fell asleep" is a euphemism for death, used frequently in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-15</a>) to convey the temporary nature of death for believers, who await resurrection. This phrase suggests a historical continuity and a perceived delay in the fulfillment of God's promises. It reflects a cultural understanding of time and history, where the passing of generations without the anticipated divine intervention leads to doubt.<p><b>&#8220;everything continues as it has from the beginning of creation.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects a worldview known as uniformitarianism, the belief that the natural world operates in a consistent and unchanging manner. It implies skepticism about divine intervention in history, contrasting with the biblical narrative of a God who acts decisively in creation and history (e.g., the flood in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>, the Exodus). The phrase challenges the reader to consider the evidence of God's past interventions and the reliability of His promises. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of creation, where God is both the initiator and sustainer of the universe (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>), and the ultimate fulfillment of His purposes is assured despite apparent delays.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, addressing the early Christian community and warning them about false teachers and scoffers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scoffers.htm">Scoffers</a></b><br>Individuals who mock or doubt the promises of God, particularly the promise of Christ's return.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers.htm">Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the patriarchs or ancestors of the faith, possibly including the early church leaders or Old Testament figures.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The beginning of the world as described in Genesis, which is referenced to emphasize the continuity of God's plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promise_of_his_coming.htm">Promise of His Coming</a></b><br>The anticipated return of Jesus Christ, a central tenet of Christian eschatology.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_scoffers.htm">Understanding Scoffers</a></b><br>Recognize that skepticism about Christ's return is not new.

Four answers have been given to this question: (1) The ancestors of the human race; (2) the patriarchs and prophets; (3) the first generation of Christians; (4) each generation of men in relation to those following. Probably nothing more definite than our remote ancestors is intended. The expression "fell asleep" is used of St. Stephen's death in <a href="/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.">Acts 7:60</a> (comp. <a href="/matthew/27-52.htm" title="And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,">Matthew 27:52</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm" title="The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.">1Corinthians 7:39</a>, where the word is not literally translated; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1Corinthians 15:18</a>, &c).

The Lord had prophesied of his coming; St. Paul had spoken more than once as if that coming were very near at hand (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>).

Already men were beginning to mock, and to question whether the long-delayed promise would ever be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">For since the fathers fell asleep;</span> better, <span class="accented">from the day that.</span> By "the fathers" must be meant here the fathers of the Christian Church. St. Peter was writing more than thirty years after the Ascension. The first generation of Christians was rapidly passing away. Stephen "fell asleep" first, then James the son of Zebedee, the other James the Lord's brother, and many others who had looked, it may be, to see the coming of the Lord among those "which are alive and remain" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>). But they had died, and he came not; and from the day of their death things went on as they were. Should men look for him still, the mockers asked, when the fathers looked in vain? The mockers adopted, in mockery, doubtless, the Christian phrase for death. The Lord first had said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ;" then the holy Stephen "fell asleep;" and so "they which are asleep" became the recognized name for the dead in Christ. Death is like sleep; the holy dead rest from their labours. They "sleep not idly," for they are at home with the Lord, and they are blessed; but yet the quiet rest of Paradise, though "far better" than this earthly life, is sleep compared with the perfect consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, which the redeemed of the Lord shall enjoy at last in his eternal glory. <span class="cmt_word">All things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation;</span> literally, <span class="accented">all things continue thus</span>, as they are, and as they have been from the beginning. There has been no sudden catastrophe; the world has gone on as it was; the laws of nature are still working with their changeless uniformity" (see a remarkable parallel in Clement, I, 23, which is important also as an independent proof that this argument of the scoffers is as old as the end of the first century). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Where</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(Pou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4226.htm">Strong's 4226: </a> </span><span class="str2">Genitive case of an interrogative pronoun pos otherwise obsolete; as adverb of place; at what locality.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
