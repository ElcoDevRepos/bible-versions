The honor and glory bestowed upon Jesus by God the Father signify His unique status as the Son of God. This event is a direct reference to the Transfiguration, where Jesus' divine nature was revealed to Peter, James, and John (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-8</a>, <a href="/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2-8</a>, <a href="/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28-36</a>). The honor and glory are not merely human accolades but divine recognition, underscoring Jesus' role in the divine plan of salvation. This moment also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah, who would be exalted by God (<a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>).<p><b>when the voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory</b><br>The "voice" refers to God's audible declaration, which is a rare and significant event in biblical history. The term "Majestic Glory" is a reverent description of God's presence, reminiscent of the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). This divine voice serves as a powerful testament to Jesus' divine sonship and authority. The event parallels God's voice at Jesus' baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>), reinforcing His divine mission and the approval of His ministry.<p><b>saying, &#8220;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration echoes the words spoken at Jesus' baptism, affirming His identity as the beloved Son of God. The phrase "beloved Son" emphasizes the unique and intimate relationship between Jesus and the Father, distinguishing Him from all others. The expression "in whom I am well pleased" indicates God's complete satisfaction with Jesus' life and mission, highlighting His sinlessness and perfect obedience (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). This statement also connects to the Messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, where God expresses delight in His chosen servant, further confirming Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who receives honor and glory from God the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who bestows honor and glory upon Jesus, affirming His identity as the beloved Son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_majestic_glory.htm">The Majestic Glory</a></b><br>A term referring to the divine presence or manifestation of God's glory, from which the voice speaks.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transfiguration.htm">The Transfiguration</a></b><br>The event being referenced, where Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James, and John, and God&#8217;s voice affirms Jesus&#8217;

Note also that the writer has not slavishly followed any of the three accounts of the Transfiguration, which a forger might be expected to do.

The meaning is "<span class= "ital">unto Whom</span> my good pleasure came and on Whom it abides." (Comp. <a href="/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a>, and Clem., <span class= "ital">Hom.</span> III. liii.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he received from God the Father honour and glory.</span> The construction here is interrupted; the literal translation is, "Having received," etc., and there is no verb to complete the sense. Winer supposes that the apostle had intended to continue with some such words as, "He had us for witnesses," or, "He was declared to be the beloved Son of God," and that the construction was interrupted by the direct quotation of the words spoken by the voice from heaven ('Grammar,' 3:45, b). (For a similar anacoluthon, see in the Greek <a href="/2_corinthians/5-6.htm">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>.) "Honour" seems to refer to the testimony of the voice from heaven; "glory," to the splendour of the Lord's transfigured Person. <span class="cmt_word">When there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">when such a voice was borne to him.</span> The same verb is used in <a href="/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a> of "the <span class="accented">rushing</span> mighty wind" which announced the coming of the Holy Ghost; and in <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a> of "the grace which is being brought." It is repeated in the next verse. It seems intended to assert emphatically the real objective character of the voice. It was not a vision, a dream; the voice was borne from heaven; the apostles heard it with their ears. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> must be rendered "by," not "from." The "excellent" (rather, "majestic," or "magnificent") glory was the Shechinah, the visible manifestation of the presence of God, which had appeared in ancient times on Mount Sinai, and in the tabernacle and temple above the mercy-seat. God was there; it was he who spoke. For the word rendered "excellent" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) compare the Septuagint Version of <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "the Majestic One of the firmament;" where our Authorized Version gives a more exact translation of the Hebrew, "in his excellency on the sky" (see also the 'Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians,' chapter 9, where the occurrence of the same remarkable words, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, suggests that Clement must have been acquainted with this Epistle). This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Our translation makes these words correspond exactly with the report given by St. Matthew in his account of the Transfiguration, except that "hear ye him" is added there. In the Greek there are some slight variations. According to one ancient manuscript (the Vatican), the order of the words is different, and there is a second pen, "This is my Son, my Beloved." All uncial manuscripts have here, instead of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span> of St. Matthew's Gospel, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. The difference cannot be represented in our translation. The construction is pregnant, and the meaning is that from all eternity the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the good pleasure, of God the Father was directed towards the Divine Son, and still abideth on him. The same truth seems to be implied in the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (comp. <a href="/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"). An imitator of the second century would certainly have made this quotation to correspond exactly with the words as given in one of the synoptic Gospels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
