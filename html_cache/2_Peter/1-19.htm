These prophecies are seen as fulfilled in Jesus Christ, confirming their truth. The phrase "confirmed beyond doubt" suggests that the fulfillment of these prophecies in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus provides irrefutable evidence of their divine origin. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that sees Jesus as the culmination of the prophetic tradition (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>). The early church relied heavily on the Old Testament prophecies to validate Jesus' messianic claims, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-16.htm">Acts 2:16-36</a>, where Peter himself uses prophecy to explain the events of Pentecost.<p><b>And you will do well to pay attention to it,</b><br>This phrase is an exhortation to heed the prophetic word, emphasizing its importance and relevance. In a cultural context where oral tradition and written texts were central to religious life, paying attention to the scriptures was a means of spiritual vigilance and growth. The call to pay attention suggests an active engagement with the word, not merely passive listening. This is consistent with the biblical theme of wisdom literature, where attention to God's word is equated with life and blessing (<a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20-22</a>).<p><b>as to a lamp shining in a dark place,</b><br>The metaphor of a lamp in darkness highlights the guidance and illumination provided by the prophetic word. In biblical times, lamps were essential for navigating the darkness, symbolizing the clarity and direction offered by God's revelation. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp to the feet and a light to the path. The "dark place" can be understood as the moral and spiritual confusion of the world, which is illuminated by the truth of scripture.<p><b>until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</b><br>This phrase points to the eschatological hope of Christ's return, often referred to as the "day of the Lord." The "morning star" is a title for Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>, symbolizing the promise of His second coming and the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom. The imagery of dawn suggests a new beginning and the dispelling of darkness, indicating the transformative power of Christ's return. The rising "in your hearts" implies an internal, spiritual awakening and readiness for His coming, aligning with the New Testament emphasis on being prepared and watchful (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:4-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, writing to encourage believers in their faith and to warn against false teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophets whose words were inspired by God and are considered reliable and authoritative.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dark_place.htm">Dark Place</a></b><br>Symbolic of the world in its fallen state, filled with sin and spiritual blindness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_dawns.htm">Day Dawns</a></b><br>Represents the coming of Christ, both in His return and in the illumination of understanding in the believer's heart.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/morning_star.htm">Morning Star</a></b><br>A reference to Christ, symbolizing hope, guidance, and the fulfillment of prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_prophetic_word.htm">The Certainty of Prophetic Word</a></b><br>The prophetic word is reliable and trustworthy, serving as a foundation for our faith.

The expression, "the prophetic word," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. "The Scripture" given below (Note on <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>), as quoted by Clement of Rome, is quoted again in the so-called Second Epistle of Clement (chap. 11) as "the prophetic word." The quotation in both cases is probably from some uncanonical book of prophecies. Here the expression means the whole body of prophecy respecting the subject in hand; but the meaning of the whole sentence is not quite clear. It may mean (i.) that the Transfiguration has made prophecies more sure, for we who were there have thus witnessed their fulfilment. In this case, however, we should have expected something more than "and" to introduce the statement, such as "and hence," "and thus," "whereby," &c. Or it may mean (ii.) that in the prophetic word we have something more sure than the voice from heaven. Here a simple "and" is natural enough; and the <span class= "ital">word</span> of prophecy is suitably compared with the <span class= "ital">voice</span> from heaven. But how can the word of prophets be more sure than the voice of God? In itself it cannot be so; but it may be so regarded (1) in reference to those who did not hear, but only heard of, the voice from heaven; (2) in reference to the subject in hand. (1) For the readers of this Epistle the many utterances of a long line of prophets, expounded by a school of teachers only second to the prophets themselves, might easily be "more sure" evidence than the narrative of a single writer; and "if they heard not Moses and the prophets, neither would they be persuaded" by the report of a voice from heaven. (2) The Transfiguration, though an earnest of Christ's future glory, was not so clear a promise of it as the express words of prophecy. If this latter interpretation be right, we have another mark of authenticity. A forger would be likely to magnify his own advantage in hearing the voice from heaven over the ordinary proofs open to every one. In any case, the coincidence with <a href="/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10-12</a> must not be overlooked. (Comp. also St. Peter's speech, <a href="/context/acts/3-20.htm" title="And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached to you:">Acts 3:20-21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">and ye do well in giving heed to it--</span>a gentle mode of exhortation, by assuming that the thing urged is being done. The exhortation is quite in harmony with <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10</a>. We have a similar construction in <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2Peter 2:10</a>, "Do not tremble in speaking evil." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have also a more sure word of prophecy;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and we have the word of prophecy made more sure</span>; or, <span class="accented">we have the word of prophecy more sure</span> (than the testimony of the heavenly voice). The rendering of the Authorized Version is ungrammatical; we must adopt one of the other modes of representing the original. The second seems to be preferred by most commentators. Thus Archdeacon Farrar, translating the passage, "And still stronger is the surety we have in the prophetic word," adds in a note, "Why more sure? Because wider in its range, and more varied, and coming from many, and bringing a more intense personal conviction than the testimony to a single fact." But when St. Peter applied the epithet "surer" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to the word of prophecy, does he mean in his own estimate of it, or in that of others? If he is speaking of himself, it is surely inconceivable that any possible testimony to the truth of the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ could be comparable with the commanding authority of the Divine voice which he himself had heard borne from heaven, and the transcendent glory which he himself had seen flashing from the Saviour's human form and bathing it in an aureole of celestial light. That heavenly voice had made the deepest possible impression on the apostles. "They fell on their faces," as Moses had done under the like circumstances, recognizing it as the voice of God. Peter had said, "Lord, it is good for us to be here;" and evidently all through his life he felt that it was good for him to dwell in solemn thought on the treasured memories of that august revelation. No written testimony could be "surer" to St. Peter than that voice from heaven. But is he rather thinking of the confirmation of the faith of his readers? He is still using the first person plural, as in verses 16 and 18; in this verse, indeed, he passes to the second; but the retaining of the first person in the first clause of the verse shows that, if he is not still speaking of apostles only, he at least includes himself among those who have the word of prophecy; and to him certainly the testimony of that word, though sacred and precious, could not be "surer" than the testimony of the heavenly voice. To Jewish Christians the evidence of the prophets of the Old Testament was of supreme importance. Nathanael, the "Israelite indeed," was drawn to the Lord by the assurance that, "We have found him of whom Moses in the Law, and the prophets, did write." The Lord himself insisted again and again upon the testimony of the prophets; so did his apostles after him. Still, it seems difficult to understand that, even to Jewish Christians, the testimony of the prophets, however sacred and weighty, could be surer than that of those apostles who made known the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, having been eye-witnesses of his majesty; while to Gentile Christians the testimony of those apostles of the Lamb who declared "what they had heard, what they had seen with their eyes, what their hands had handled, of the Word of life," must have had greater power to convince than the predictions of the Hebrew prophets, though these predictions, fulfilled as they were in the Lord Jesus, furnish subsidiary evidence of exceeding value. On the whole, the more probable meaning of St. Peter seems to be that the word of prophecy was made more sure to himself, and, through his teaching, to others by the overwhelming testimony of the voice from heaven and the glory of the Transfiguration. He had become a disciple long before. His brother Andrew had first told him that Jesus was the Messiah; he himself, a week before the Transfiguration, had confessed him solemnly to be "the Christ, the Son of the living God? But the Transfiguration deepened that faith into the most intense conviction; it made the word of prophecy which spoke of Christ surer and more certain. It is not without interest that the writer of the so-called 'Second Epistle of Clement' quotes (chapter 11) from "the prophetic word" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), passages which resemble <a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a> and <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>. Whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place. There is a parallel to the first clause of this in Josephus, 'Ant.,' 11:6, 12; to the second in 2 Esdr. 12:42. The word rendered "light" is rather a lamp or torch; our Lord uses it of John the Baptist (<a href="/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>). The word translated "dark" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is found only here in the New Testament; it means "dry, parched, and so squalid, desert;" there seems to be no sufficient authority for the rendering "dark." God's Word is a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our path; the word of prophecy guides us to Christ. Until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts; literally, <span class="accented">until day dawn through</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "through the gloom." There is no article. The word for "day-star" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;</span>v, lucifer, light-bringer) is found in no other place of the New Testament; but comp. <a href="/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>. St. Peter seems to mean that the prophetic word, rendered more sure to the apostles by the voice from heaven, and to Christians generally by apostolic witness, shines like a guiding lamp, till the fuller light of day dawns upon the soul, as the believer, led by the prophetic word, realizes the personal knowledge of the Lord, and he manifests himself according to his blessed promises to the heart that longs for his sacred presence. He is the Bright and Morning Star, the Day-star, the Light-bringer; for he is the Light of the world - he brings the light, the full light of day. The prophetic word is precious; it sheds light upon the surrounding darkness - the darkness of ignorance, the darkness of the heart that knows not Christ; but its light is as the light of a torch or a lamp, compared with the pervading daylight which the felt presence of Christ sheds into those hearts into which God hath shined to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>). Some understand "day" here of the great day of the Lord. Against this interpretation is the absence of the article, and the fact that the last words of the verse seem to give a subjective meaning to the passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We also have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(echomen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
