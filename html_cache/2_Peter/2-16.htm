Balaam was a non-Israelite prophet who was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites. Despite knowing God's will, Balaam was tempted by the promise of wealth and honor. His transgression was his willingness to go against God's command for personal gain. This serves as a warning against the dangers of greed and the importance of obedience to God.<p><b>by a donkey, otherwise without speech</b><br>The donkey, an animal typically without the ability to speak, becomes the instrument of God's message. This highlights God's sovereignty and ability to use any means to accomplish His purposes. The use of a donkey, a humble and lowly creature, contrasts with Balaam's status as a prophet, emphasizing that God can use the least expected to fulfill His will. This also serves as a reminder of the humility required in serving God.<p><b>that spoke with a man&#8217;s voice</b><br>The miraculous event of the donkey speaking with a human voice underscores the seriousness of Balaam's error. It is a supernatural intervention that captures Balaam's attention and serves as a divine rebuke. This event is unique in Scripture, illustrating the lengths to which God will go to correct and guide His people. It also prefigures the concept of God using unexpected voices to convey His truth, as seen in the New Testament with the inclusion of Gentiles and others outside the traditional Jewish framework.<p><b>and restrained the prophet&#8217;s madness</b><br>Balaam's madness refers to his irrational and sinful desire to defy God's will for personal gain. The term "madness" indicates a departure from wisdom and reason, which is often associated with sin in biblical literature. The restraint provided by the donkey's intervention prevented Balaam from proceeding further into sin, demonstrating God's mercy and patience. This phrase serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of pursuing one's own desires over God's commands and the importance of heeding divine warnings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A prophet who is known for his encounter with the angel of the Lord and his talking donkey.

The guilt of offering the wages of unrighteousness rested with Balak; Balaam's own transgression lay in his readiness to accept them - in his willingness to break the law of God by cursing, for filthy lucre's sake, those whom God had not cursed. The dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbade the madness of the prophet. The word for "ass" is literally "beast of burden" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>). "Dumb" is literally "without voice;" naturally without voice, it spake with the voice of man. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, rendered "forbade," is rather "checked," or "stayed."

The ass checked the prophet's folly by her shrinking from the angel, and by the miracle that followed; the angel, while permitting Balaam to expose himself to the danger into which he had fallen by tempting the Lord, forbade any deviation from the word to be put into his mouth by God. Balaam obeyed in the letter; but afterwards the madness which had been checked for the moment led him into deadly sin (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). We observe that St. Peter assumes the truthfulness of the narrative in the Book of Numbers (see Mr. Clark's note in the 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eschen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
