It reflects the divine support that was also promised to the patriarchs and leaders of Israel. The phrase suggests a continuous divine presence and power that will ensure Joshua's success in leading the Israelites into the Promised Land. This echoes the covenantal promises made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and the assurance given to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament promise of victory over spiritual adversaries (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p><b>As I was with Moses, so will I be with you;</b><br>This statement establishes continuity in leadership and divine support from Moses to Joshua. It reassures Joshua that the same God who performed miracles and guided Moses will now guide him. This continuity is crucial for maintaining the faith and morale of the Israelites as they transition to new leadership. It also highlights the importance of God's presence in fulfilling His promises, as seen in the miraculous events during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). This assurance is a type of Christ, who promises to be with His followers always (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><b>I will never leave you nor forsake you.</b><br>This promise of God's unwavering presence is a cornerstone of faith for believers. It assures Joshua of God's constant companionship and support, regardless of the challenges ahead. This promise is reiterated throughout Scripture, emphasizing God's faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>). It provides comfort and strength, encouraging believers to trust in God's enduring presence. This assurance is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's promise to be with His people, offering eternal security and peace (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the successor of Moses and the leader of the Israelites as they enter the Promised Land.

If Joshua trusts and obeys, resistance cannot prevail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As I was with Moses, so will I be with you</b><p>The promise shifts from what God will do to how He will do it&#8212;by His personal, uninterrupted presence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will surely be with you&#8221;&#8212;was God&#8217;s word to Moses at the burning bush; now the same words belong to Joshua.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10&#8211;12</a> recounts the unique signs God worked through Moses, underscoring the weight of this comparison.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a> affirms, &#8220;I, the LORD, do not change,&#8221; so the quality of God&#8217;s faithfulness remains constant from leader to leader, generation to generation.<p>Joshua&#8217;s call is not to imitate Moses&#8217; style but to rely on the same abiding Presence that made Moses effective.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will never leave you nor forsake you</b><p>The promise crescendos in a double guarantee: God will neither depart (leave) nor abandon (forsake).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6, 8</a> had already given Israel this assurance as they approached the Jordan.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a> declares, &#8220;Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a> records Jesus echoing the same words: &#8220;And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&#8221;<p>This covenantal vow is unconditional; it does not hinge on circumstances, emotions, or geography.

God pledges that no foe will withstand Joshua, that the same divine companionship granted to Moses now rests on him, and that this relationship is irrevocable. For every believer, the verse reinforces that success in God&#8217;s mission flows from His faithful presence, not personal prowess, and that His commitment to His people endures through every challenge, all the days of their lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</span>--Compare <a href="/genesis/28-15.htm" title="And, behold, I am with you, and will keep you in all places where you go, and will bring you again into this land; for I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken to you of.">Genesis 28:15</a>.
