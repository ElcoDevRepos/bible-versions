The Canaanite cities, despite witnessing the power of God through Israel's victories, chose to resist rather than seek peace. This reflects the hardness of their hearts and fulfills the divine mandate given to Israel to conquer the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). The refusal to make peace can be seen as a fulfillment of God's judgment against the Canaanites for their idolatry and wickedness (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p><b>except the Hivites living in Gibeon</b><br>The Gibeonites, a group of Hivites, are noted for their unique approach to the advancing Israelites. Unlike other Canaanite cities, they sought peace through deception, as detailed in <a href="/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>. They disguised themselves as travelers from a distant land to secure a treaty with Israel. This act of cunning is significant as it spared them from destruction and integrated them into Israelite society, albeit as servants. The Gibeonites' decision can be seen as a recognition of the power of Israel's God, contrasting with the defiance of other Canaanite cities.<p><b>all others were taken in battle</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of Israel's military campaign in Canaan. The conquest was marked by numerous battles, as the Israelites, under Joshua's leadership, systematically defeated the Canaanite cities. This military success is attributed to divine intervention and fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>, <a href="/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23</a>). The phrase also highlights the theme of divine justice, as the conquest served as a judgment against the Canaanite nations for their sins. The battles were not merely human endeavors but were seen as acts of divine will, with God fighting for Israel (<a href="/joshua/10-42.htm">Joshua 10:42</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, tasked with conquering the Promised Land.
