The process of presenting themselves tribe by tribe reflects the organized structure of Israelite society, which was divided into twelve tribes. This methodical approach underscores the seriousness of the situation and the need for communal accountability. The morning time also aligns with the biblical theme of light revealing truth, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, where joy comes in the morning.<p><b>The tribe that the LORD selects shall come forward clan by clan,</b><br>The selection by the LORD indicates divine sovereignty and the belief that God is actively involved in the affairs of His people. The process of narrowing down from tribe to clan highlights the meticulous nature of divine justice. This method of selection is reminiscent of the Urim and Thummim, tools used by the high priest to discern God's will, as seen in <a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>. The clan structure within a tribe reflects the extended family units that were central to Israelite social organization.<p><b>and the clan that the LORD selects shall come forward family by family,</b><br>The further narrowing down to family units emphasizes the personal nature of sin and accountability. It reflects the biblical principle that while sin can affect the community, it often begins at the individual or family level. This process mirrors the investigative nature of God's justice, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23-33</a>, where Abraham intercedes for Sodom, and God agrees to spare the city if righteous individuals are found.<p><b>and the family that the LORD selects shall come forward man by man.</b><br>The final step of selecting man by man underscores the individual responsibility each person holds before God. This phrase highlights the biblical theme of personal accountability, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, where it is stated that each person is responsible for their own sin. The process reflects the thoroughness of divine judgment, ensuring that the guilty party is identified and justice is served. This meticulous selection process foreshadows the ultimate judgment where each individual will stand before God, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.

The verse assures us that the Lord knows every secret, deals righteously with it, and invites repentance before judgment falls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14-18) In the morning therefore ye shall be brought.--That is, <span class= "ital">brought near, </span>or <span class= "ital">presented. </span>The word used here, and throughout the passage, is the same that is commonly used for the presentation of an offering.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">The tribe which the Lord taketh.</span>--There is nothing in the language of the passage, when closely considered, which would lead us to suppose that the discovery of the criminal was by casting lots. The parallel passage--viz., the selection of King Saul from the tribes of Israel (<a href="/context/1_samuel/10-20.htm" title="And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.">1Samuel 10:20-21</a>)--shows that the oracle of God was consulted. "They inquired," and "the Lord answered." So it was, perhaps, in the case of Achan. We seem to see the High Priest of Israel "asking counsel for Joshua after the judgment of Urim before the Lord," as it had been foretold in <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a>; and the elders of Israel standing by, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. The representatives of the tribes enter the sacred enclosure in succession, and pass before the High Priest, in awful silence, broken only by the voice of Jehovah, who pronounces it intervals the names of <span class= "ital">Judah, Zarhite, Zabdi, Carmi, Achan. </span>It must have been a terrible ordeal. But all present must have felt that no human partiality, or private animosity, was seeking its victim. The Judge of all the earth was doing judgment. And when the accusation of Jehovah was followed by the explicit confession of the criminal, and this again by the discovery of the stolen spoil of Jericho, which was brought in by the messengers, and "poured out before the Lord," and when this discovery was followed by the execution of the awful sentence, all who were present must have received a lesson, which it was impossible to forget, as to the reality of the covenant of God. And if, as seems most probable, the voice of the oracle was uttered from the inner sanctuary, from between the cherubim, but "heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God, when He speaketh" (<a href="/ezekiel/10-5.htm" title="And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.">Ezekiel 10:5</a>), we learn once more the majesty of the law given to Israel. The arrest of Jordan, the overthrow of Jericho, and the discovery of Achan, are all manifestations of power proceeding from the same source.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Taketh</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by lot, as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-42.htm">1 Samuel 14:42</a> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> make it <span class="accented">fall</span>; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20</a>) (cf. <a href="/jonah/1-7.htm">Jonah 1:7</a>; also <a href="/proverbs/18-18.htm">Proverbs 18:18</a>). According to the families. The gradual centering of the suspicion upon the offender is one of the most striking features of the history. The genealogies of the children of Israel were very strictly kept, as the Books of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah show. Achan's name is carefully given in the genealogy of Judah in 1 Chronicles if. 7. The subdivision of the tribes into families (or <span class="accented">clans</span>, Keil) and households (or, as we should perhaps say, <span class="accented">families</span>) was for convenience of enumeration, military organisation, and perhaps of assessment. Oehler, 'Theologie des Allen Testaments,' Sec. 101, takes the same view as Keil. The tribes, he says, were divided into <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5c3;&#x5da;&#x5c3;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, Geschlechter (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, for which the best English equivalent is <span class="accented">clans</span>, as above); these into families or houses (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), or fathers' hours (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>); and these again into single heads of a house (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The principle, he adds of a Mosaic family, is as follows: Every <span class="accented">"family"</span> forms a distinct whole, which as far as possible must be maintained in its integrity. Each tribe, says Jahn ('Hebrew Commonwealth,' Book II.), acknowledged a prince (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) as its ruler. As its numbers increased, there arose a subdivision of the tribe into collections of families. Such a collection was called a house of fathers, a <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or clan, or a thousand, rut this explanation is not so satisfactory as that given above. Kurz remarks on the important part family life played among the Hebrews, with whom, in consequence of their descent from Abraham, and the importance they attached to it, the nation was developed out of the family.
