The use of a visible sign is a recurring biblical theme, emphasizing faith and obedience.<p><b>through which you let us down,</b><br>This refers to the method of escape for the spies, highlighting Rahab's role in aiding them.

This mirrors the story of Noah, where his obedience led to the salvation of his household (<a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>).

The "line of scarlet thread" and the <span class= "ital">"</span>stalks of flax" on the roof were probably parts of the same business, and thus there would be nothing unusual in what was exhibited at the window, although it would be a sufficient token to those who were in the secret, to enable them to identify the house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This line of scarlet thread.</span> Rather, this <span class="accented">rope</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> to twist.
