The sword is often a symbol of divine judgment in the Bible, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>. The use of the sword here signifies the fulfillment of God's command to Joshua and the Israelites to conquer the land of Canaan, as previously instructed in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>.<p><b>they devoted to destruction</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" translates the Hebrew word "herem," which means to consecrate or set apart for God, often through complete destruction. This concept is rooted in the idea of purging evil and ensuring the purity of the Israelites, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>. It reflects the seriousness of God's command to eliminate idolatry and sin from the land.<p><b>everything in the city</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of the destruction, leaving nothing behind that could lead the Israelites into idolatry or sin. The comprehensive nature of the destruction is a reminder of the holiness required by God and the need to remove all influences that could corrupt the covenant community.<p><b>man and woman, young and old</b><br>The inclusion of all people, regardless of age or gender, highlights the severity of the judgment against Jericho. This reflects the collective responsibility and the pervasive sin of the Canaanite culture, which had reached its full measure of iniquity, as mentioned in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>. It also serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin.<p><b>oxen, sheep, and donkeys</b><br>The destruction of livestock indicates the complete eradication of the city's resources and economic life. This act ensured that nothing from Jericho would be used by the Israelites, maintaining the purity of their worship and reliance on God. It also symbolizes the totality of God's judgment, as seen in other instances of herem, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.
