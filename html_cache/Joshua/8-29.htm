In <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>, the law states that a hanged man is cursed by God, and his body should not remain on the tree overnight. This act signifies the complete defeat of Ai and serves as a warning to other nations. The hanging of the king symbolizes the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over their enemies.<p><b>and at sunset Joshua commanded that they take down the body from the tree</b><br>Joshua's command aligns with the Mosaic Law, which required that a hanged body be buried the same day to avoid defiling the land. This demonstrates Joshua's adherence to God's commandments, even in the treatment of enemies. It also reflects the importance of maintaining ritual purity and obedience to God's laws.<p><b>and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate</b><br>The entrance of the city gate was a place of judgment and public assembly in ancient cities. By placing the king's body there, it served as a public declaration of Ai's defeat and a reminder of God's judgment. This act would have been a powerful visual message to both the Israelites and surrounding nations.<p><b>And over it they raised a large pile of rocks</b><br>Raising a pile of rocks over the body was a common practice to mark significant events or burials. This heap of stones served as a memorial of Israel's victory and God's faithfulness. Similar stone memorials are seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as the stones set up by Joshua at the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>).<p><b>which remains to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates that the account was written at a time when the memorial still existed, serving as a lasting testament to the events that took place.

But when we read of this treatment of the enemies of Joshua, we cannot but be reminded of the greater Joshua, who fulfilled the curse of God in His own person, and made a show of the "principalities and powers" by triumphing over them in His cross. (Comp. also <a href="/esther/9-10.htm" title="The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.">Esther 9:10</a>; <a href="/esther/9-13.htm" title="Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.">Esther 9:13</a>.)<p>Jericho and Ai are the only cities of Canaan of which the capture by Joshua is recorded in detail. Their capture stands in the narrative, as it was in fact, a specimen of the whole conquest of the Canaanite <span class= "ital">cities. </span>Two campaigns in like manner are recorded as specimens of Joshua's battles with the enemy in the open field. In the capture of Jericho and in the southern campaign, the hand of God is more especially manifested. In the capture of Ai and in the northern campaign, the labour of Israel in the conflict is more prominent. The whole work is thus presented to us in a twofold aspect, as the work of Israel and the work of God. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/8-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He hung</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8518.htm">Strong's 8518: </a> </span><span class="str2">To suspend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the body of the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1447;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Ai</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
