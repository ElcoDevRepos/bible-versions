This natural phenomenon makes crossing the river particularly challenging, emphasizing the miraculous nature of the Israelites' crossing. The timing during the harvest season, likely around April, aligns with the Passover, a period of great significance in Israel's history. This overflowing symbolizes obstacles that seem insurmountable without divine intervention, drawing parallels to other biblical events where God intervenes in nature, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>).<p><b>But as soon as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan</b><br>The priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant represent God's presence among His people. The Ark, containing the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, signifies God's covenant, guidance, and provision. The priests' role underscores the importance of spiritual leadership and obedience in the face of daunting challenges. This act of faith by the priests is reminiscent of the faith required by the Israelites when they first left Egypt, highlighting a recurring theme of trust in God's promises.<p><b>and their feet touched the water&#8217;s edge,</b><br>The moment the priests' feet touch the water signifies the activation of God's promise through an act of faith. This step into the water is a physical manifestation of trust, akin to Peter stepping out of the boat to walk on water (<a href="/matthew/14-29.htm">Matthew 14:29</a>). It illustrates the principle that faith often requires action before witnessing God's power. This event foreshadows the New Testament teaching of living by faith and not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>), and it typifies the believer's journey of stepping into the unknown, trusting in God's provision and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical and spiritual boundary for the Israelites, representing the transition from the wilderness into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Levites carrying the Ark of the Covenant, symbolizing God's presence and guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest containing the tablets of the Law, representing God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/harvest_season.htm">Harvest Season</a></b><br>A time when the Jordan River was at its fullest, making the crossing more miraculous.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The priests had to step into the overflowing Jordan before the waters parted.

But this rendering is contrary <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the Hebrew, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> contrary to fact. <p>The literal rendering here is, "filleth <span class="accented">out</span> (or <span class="accented">upon</span>) all its banks." In ch. 4:18 we read that Jordan goeth <span class="accented">over</span> all its banks And that the Jordan is not merely full, but full to overflowing, at the harvest season, is proved by the statements of many travellers. Take, for instance, Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 223), who describes his visit to the Jordan as occurring just after it had been overflowing its banks, and the lower level of the valley as filled with "a deep slimy ooze." He adds that, by measure merit, the river was found to have been fourteen feet above the level at which he found it, and it was then quite full. Bartlett ('From Egypt to Palestine,' p. 451) remarks, "We were fortunate enough to see it in the state in which it is described in Joshua, 'overflowing all its banks' - that is, the whole line of its banks. The turbid stream rushed along like a mill race, and though it had fallen from its greatest height, the proper banks of the channel were invisible, and indicated only by lines of oleanders and other shrubs and trees." This was on the 22nd of March. This overflowing is caused by the melting of the snows of Hermon, which then rush down, fill Lake Huleh and its marshes, as well as Gennesareth, and cause the "swelling of Jordan" (<a href="/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; 1:44), which drives the wild beasts from their retreats on its banks (see also <a href="/1_chronicles/12-15.htm">1 Chronicles 12:15</a>). Some travellers have boldly asserted, in spite of this concurrent testimony, that Jordan does not overflow its banks at the time of harvest. But they have mistaken the wheat for the barley harvest, forgetting that in Palestine the latter precedes the former by six or seven weeks. By the time of wheat harvest Jordan has returned to its normal condition, and all traces of the inundation have passed away (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' pp. 618-621). <span class="cmt_word">The time of harvest,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the barley harvest, which took place about the 10th Nisan, or Abib, when the Israelites crossed. The wheat harvest was about Pentecost, or seven weeks later (<a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>). An important argument for the genuineness of the narrative (and much the more important as its chief incident is miraculous) is drawn from this passage by Blunt in his 'Undesigned Coincidences.' He remarks that in <a href="/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 33</a> the barley and flax are said to have ripened together. Therefore the time of the barley and flax harvest would be identical. Accordingly we have Rahab, three days before the event here recorded, in possession of the as yet undried stalks of flax which had just been cut. Nothing could be a more satisfactory proof that the narrative we have before us comes from persons who were accurately and minutely informed concerning the circumstances of which they tell us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the Jordan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;yar&#183;d&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
