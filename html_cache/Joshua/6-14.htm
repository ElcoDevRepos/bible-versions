This repetition underscores the importance of following God's instructions precisely, even when the immediate outcome is not visible. The number two in biblical numerology often signifies confirmation or witness, suggesting that the Israelites' actions were a testimony to their faith in God's plan.<p><b>they marched around the city once</b><br>The act of marching around Jericho was a strategic and symbolic gesture. Jericho was a fortified city, and the Israelites' silent march demonstrated their reliance on divine intervention rather than military might. This action also served as a psychological tactic, instilling fear and uncertainty among the inhabitants of Jericho. The march can be seen as a precursor to the spiritual warfare described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are called to rely on God's power rather than their own.<p><b>and returned to the camp</b><br>Returning to the camp each day highlights the discipline and routine in the Israelites' obedience. The camp represents a place of rest and preparation, where the Israelites could reflect on God's promises and prepare for the fulfillment of His plan. This cycle of action and rest is reminiscent of the Sabbath principle, where work is balanced with rest and reflection on God's provision.<p><b>They did this for six days</b><br>The six-day period of marching is significant, as the number six often represents human effort and incompleteness in biblical numerology. It sets the stage for the seventh day, a number associated with completion and divine intervention. This pattern foreshadows the ultimate victory that comes not through human strength but through God's power, paralleling the creation narrative where God completed His work on the seventh day. The six days of marching also serve as a test of faith and perseverance, similar to the trials faced by believers as described in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.
