The half-tribe of Manasseh received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan, which was part of the Transjordan region. This allocation was significant because it demonstrated Moses' role in fulfilling God's promises to the patriarchs regarding the land. The division of the tribe of Manasseh into two parts, one on each side of the Jordan, reflects the tribe's size and influence. This allocation also highlights the importance of family and clan structures in ancient Israelite society, as land was distributed according to these divisions.<p><b>that is, to half the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh</b><br>The tribe of Manasseh was one of the two sons of Joseph, who was one of Jacob's twelve sons. The division of Manasseh into two half-tribes, one on each side of the Jordan River, is unique among the tribes of Israel. This division is a fulfillment of Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>, where he adopts Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, as his own, effectively giving Joseph a double portion among the tribes. The descendants of Manasseh who settled east of the Jordan were known for their valor and played a significant role in the military campaigns of Israel.

Scripture often pauses to clarify so no promise is misunderstood (e.g., <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p>&#8211; It guards against jealousy or confusion among the remaining tribes (<a href="/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10-12</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s Word is precise; He leaves no room for guessing about inheritance (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to half the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh</b><p>&#8211; Only half the tribe settled east of the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>). The other half would inherit west of the river (<a href="/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7-11</a>), demonstrating that God can bless in diverse locations while keeping unity of identity.<p>&#8211; The split anticipates future challenges (<a href="/joshua/22-11.htm">Joshua 22:11-34</a>), yet also showcases faithfulness: both halves remain sons of Manasseh and heirs of the same covenant.<p>&#8211; This division foreshadows the broader truth that God&#8217;s family can be geographically scattered yet spiritually one (<a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>).<p>&#8211; It encourages believers today that God&#8217;s gifts fit our specific assignments, even when they differ from those of our brothers and sisters (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29</a> confirms that God&#8217;s promises made through Moses remain intact under Joshua. The verse highlights divine generosity, orderly inheritance, and meticulous care for every clan within Manasseh. By specifying that only half the tribe settled east of the Jordan, Scripture showcases God&#8217;s ability to distribute blessings uniquely while preserving unity. The passage urges us to trust God&#8217;s precise, faithful provision for His people&#8212;then and now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The halftribe of Manasseh.</span> The word used for "tribe" in the first and second half of this verse is not the same. Some German critics have derived an argument for the hypothesis that the historical and geographical portions of the book are not by the same hand, from the supposed fact that the former of these words is used almost exclusively in the first, or historical portion, and the latter in the second, or geographical portion, of the book. The word "almost" would be <span class="accented">almost</span> sufficient to overthrow the theory, but this verse is an insuperable objection to it. Is it seriously contended that one half of this verse is taken from one author, and the other from another? Or is it possible that the writer of the book may actually have understood the language he was using, and meant to use the two words in somewhat different senses? Gesenius, it is true, would explain the words as being precisely synonymous. But his own etymological remarks are fatal to his theory. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> the latter of the two words, is a <span class="accented">bough</span>, or <span class="accented">shoot</span> (derived from a word signifying to <span class="accented">grow</span>), capable of throwing out blossoms (<a href="/ezekiel/7-10.htm">Ezekiel 7:10</a>). It refers, therefore, to the natural descent of the tribe from Manasseh their father. But <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is allied to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e4;&#x5d8;</span>; to judge, and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and perhaps the English <span class="accented">shaft</span>, and signifies a rod as the emblem of authority. Thus it is used in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, of a royal sceptre. So <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, an iron sceptre, <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>. Thus the latter word has reference to the tribe as an organised community, the former to it in reference to its ancestral derivation. This view would seem to be supported by ver. 24, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> of Gad is further explained to mean his <span class="accented">sons and their families</span>, as well as by this verse, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is used absolutely, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> in connection with the family <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/13-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[This is what] Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had given</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
