The sin of Achan, who took forbidden items from Jericho, affected the entire nation, leading to their defeat at Ai. This highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the actions of one could impact the whole community. Joshua, as the leader, voices the collective distress and seeks to understand the breach in their covenant with God.<p><b>&#8220;Today the LORD will bring trouble upon you!&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores the principle of divine justice. The Hebrew word for "trouble" (Achar) is a play on Achan's name, indicating that his actions have brought divine retribution upon himself. The justice of God is immediate and serves as a warning to the Israelites about the seriousness of disobedience. It also reflects the holiness of God, who cannot tolerate sin within His people.<p><b>And all Israel stoned him to death.</b><br>The communal execution signifies the collective responsibility and the need to purge evil from among them to restore their standing with God. Stoning was a common form of capital punishment in ancient Israel, intended to remove sin and deter others from similar transgressions. This act also fulfills the law as stated in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>, where the community participates in the execution of justice.<p><b>Then they stoned the others and burned their bodies.</b><br>The "others" likely refers to Achan's family, who may have been complicit in his sin. The burning of their bodies signifies complete destruction, ensuring that no trace of the sin remains. This act of total eradication is consistent with the instructions given for dealing with things devoted to destruction (herem), as seen in the conquest of Canaan. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for holiness among God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.

The passage teaches the enduring principles of God&#8217;s justice, the far-reaching impact of individual sin, and the urgent need for wholehearted obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stoned him with stones.</span> The word here is not the same as in the last part of the verse. It has been suggested that the former word signifies to stone a living person, the second to heap up stones upon a dead one; and this derives confirmation from the fact that the former word has the signification of piling up, while the latter rather gives the idea of the weight of the pile. Some have gathered from the use of the singular here, that Achan only was stoned; but the use of the plural immediately afterwards implies the contrary, unless, with Knobel, we have recourse to the suggestion that "them" is a "mistake of the Deuteronomist" for "him." It is of course possible that his family were only taken there to witness the solemn judgment upon their father. But the use of the singular and plural in Hebrew is frequently very indefinite (see <a href="/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17, 19</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>.
