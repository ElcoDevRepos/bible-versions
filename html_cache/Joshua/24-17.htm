The LORD, Yahweh, is acknowledged as the covenant God who intervened in history to rescue His people. The Exodus is a foundational event, symbolizing salvation and liberation. It is frequently referenced throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6</a>) and serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, as seen in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>, where Jesus' death is referred to as an "exodus").<p><b>out of the house of slavery</b><br>The "house of slavery" refers to the oppressive conditions the Israelites endured in Egypt. This phrase underscores the transformation from bondage to freedom, a theme that resonates with the spiritual liberation found in Christ (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>). Historically, Egypt was a powerful empire, and the Israelites' deliverance from it demonstrated God's supremacy over earthly powers.<p><b>and performed these great signs before our eyes</b><br>The "great signs" refer to the miraculous events during the Exodus, such as the plagues (Exodus 7-12), the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14), and the provision of manna (Exodus 16). These signs served to authenticate Moses' leadership and God's power. They foreshadow the miracles of Jesus, which confirm His divine authority (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p><b>He also protected us throughout our journey</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's providential care during the Israelites' 40-year journey in the wilderness. Despite their frequent disobedience, God provided guidance (pillar of cloud and fire, <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), sustenance (manna and quail, <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>), and protection from enemies (e.g., Amalekites, <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). This journey is often seen as a metaphor for the Christian life, with God guiding and sustaining His people (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><b>and among all the nations through which we traveled</b><br>The nations mentioned include those encountered during the wilderness wanderings and the conquest of Canaan. God's protection against these nations (e.g., Amorites, Moabites) demonstrated His faithfulness to His promises (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This protection prefigures the spiritual victory believers have in Christ over the powers of darkness (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

The Israelites, we may observe, were no sceptics, nor ever became such. Their sin was not open rebellion, but the attempt to engraft upon God's service conduct incompatible with it, which led in practice to the same result - a final antagonism to God. But they believed in Jehovah; they had no doubt of the miracles He had worked, nor of the fact that His protecting hand had delivered them from all their perils, and had achieved for them all their victories. Nor do we find, amid all their sins, that they ever committed themselves to a formal denial of His existence and authority. To this, in the worst times, the prophets appeal, and though Israelitish obstinacy contested their conclusions, it never disputed their premises. <span class="cmt_word">Did those great signs.</span> Here the people, in their answer, imply the circumstances which Joshua had omitted.
