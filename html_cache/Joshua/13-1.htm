This phrase indicates a transition in leadership and responsibility. Joshua's age suggests he has fulfilled much of his mission, leading the Israelites into the Promised Land. His age also reflects the passage of time since the Exodus and the wilderness wanderings. In biblical terms, age often signifies wisdom and experience, but also the need for succession planning, as seen with Moses and now Joshua.<p><b>and the LORD said to him</b><br>The direct communication from the LORD to Joshua underscores the divine guidance that has been a hallmark of Joshua's leadership. This phrase emphasizes the continued relationship between God and His chosen leaders. It also reflects the biblical theme of God speaking to His people, providing direction and assurance. This divine interaction is consistent with other instances in Scripture where God speaks to His prophets and leaders, such as Moses at the burning bush or Samuel in the temple.<p><b>&#8220;You are old and well along in years</b><br>The repetition of Joshua's age by the LORD highlights the importance of recognizing the limitations of human leaders and the need for divine intervention and guidance. It serves as a reminder that while human leaders may age and pass on, God's purposes and plans continue. This acknowledgment of Joshua's age also sets the stage for the transition of leadership to the next generation, as seen later with figures like Caleb and the judges.<p><b>but very much of the land remains to be possessed.</b><br>Despite the victories and conquests under Joshua's leadership, the task of fully possessing the Promised Land remains incomplete. This phrase points to the ongoing challenge faced by the Israelites to fully claim the inheritance promised to them by God. It reflects the tension between the "already" and "not yet" aspects of God's promises. The incomplete possession of the land serves as a metaphor for the Christian life, where believers are called to continue striving towards spiritual maturity and the fulfillment of God's promises. This also foreshadows the future struggles Israel will face in maintaining control over the land, as seen in the period of the Judges and the monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Joshua is the leader of the Israelites after Moses.

The work is God&#8217;s&#8212;He will carry it forward (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8211; This balance of realism and calling echoes Paul&#8217;s confession, &#8220;Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and very much of the land remains to be possessed</b><p>&#8211; Despite great victories, unfinished territory still lies ahead (<a href="/joshua/18-3.htm">Joshua 18:3</a>).

He did not live beyond a hundred and ten years (<a href="/joshua/24-29.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.">Joshua 24:29</a>), and this was not a great age for the time. But in several instances the Hebrew word here employed is used not so much in respect of the number of years men lived, but rather in regard to the weakening of the vital powers. So it is said in Genesis 27, "Isaac was old," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>he had aged, for he lived forty-three years after that. So in regard to David, "the king was very old," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>much aged, in <a href="/1_kings/1-15.htm" title="And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered to the king.">1Kings 1:15</a>, for he could not have been more than seventy when he died. The hardships and anxieties of his life had aged him. So it was perhaps with Joshua. Moses was a signal exception; he had not aged at one hundred and twenty. But Jehovah constantly talked with Moses, and knew him face to face; and may we not say that <span class= "ital">that </span>heavenly intercourse even sustained the vital powers? The work of the Lord, though it be successfully carried on, as it was by Joshua, may wear men out by its very excitement. But personal intercourse with Him is like eating of the tree of life, and "in His presence is the fulness of joy." In this personal intercourse Moses was more highly favoured than his successor, Joshua.<p>(1, 7) <span class= "bld">There remaineth yet very much land to be possessed . . . Now therefore divide this land.</span>--The land had still to be <span class= "ital">inherited</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>not overrun, or conquered, as far as it could be said to be conquered by defeating the armies that took the field; all this was done already, but the land had not passed out of the hands of its actual possessors into the hands of Israel. It is remarkable that we have here a distinct order given to Joshua to divide to Israel land which was <span class= "ital">not yet conquered. </span>In these verses several nations are named--viz., the Philistines, the Geshurites, the Avites, the Giblites, the Sidonians, besides anything more which may be included in the sometimes generic, and sometimes more specific, name of the Canaanites. Of these tribes, the Philistines and "all the Sidonians" (or Ph?nicians) were certainly not yet conquered. Can we say that they were ever conquered at any period in the history of the kingdom of all Israel, except in so far as they were reduced to the condition of tributaries? . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - NOW <span class="cmt_word">Joshua was old.</span> This is usually regarded as the second part of the Book of Joshua; the first being devoted to the history of the conquest of Palestine, while the second is engaged with the history of its division among the conquerors. Dean Stanley, in his 'Sinai and Palestine,' as well as in his 'Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church,' describes this portion of the Book of Judges as the 'Domes. day Book' of the land of Canaan, and the remark has been constantly repeated. There is, however, a considerable difference between the great survey of the Conqueror and this one. The former was an accurate account, for purposes of taxation, national detente, and public order, of the exact extent of soil owned by each landowner, and it went so far as to enumerate the cattle on his estate, to the great disgust of the Saxon chronicler, who had an Englishman's dislike of inquisitorial proceedings. There is no trace either of such completeness, or of such an inquisitorial character in this survey, neither has it quite the same object. It assigns to each tribe the limits of its future possessions, and enumerates the cities contained in each portion of territory. Bat it makes scarcely any effort to describe the possessions of particular families, still less of individual landowners. Joshua and Caleb are the only exceptions. Knobel observes that the most powerful tribes were first settled in their territory - those, namely, of Judah and Joseph. He remarks that the author must have had written sources for his information, for no single Israelite could have been personally acquainted with all the details here given. <span class="cmt_word">And stricken in years.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">advanced in age.</span> There is no foundation for the idea of some commentators that the Jews, at the time this book was written, made any formal distinction in these words between different stages of old age. The Hebrew language rejoiced in repetition, and this common phrase is only a means of adding emphasis to the statement already made. <span class="cmt_word">And there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> is stronger than our version. Perhaps the best equivalent in modern English is, <span class="accented">"And the amount of land that remaineth for us to occupy is very great indeed."</span> We may observe here that, as with the literal so with the spiritual Israel, whether the antitype be the Christian Church or the human heart, the work of subduing God's enemies is gradual. One successful engagement does not conclude the war. The enemy renews his assaults, and when force fails he tries fraud; when direct temptations are of no avail he resorts to enticements. The only safeguard in the war is strength, alertness, courage, patience. The faint hearted and unwatchful alike fail in the contest, which can be carried on successfully only by him who has learned to keep guard over himself, and to direct his ways by the counsels of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
