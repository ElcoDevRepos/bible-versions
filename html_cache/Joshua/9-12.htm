The mention of "warm bread" suggests freshness and immediacy, indicating that their journey supposedly began recently. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bread was a staple food, and its freshness was a sign of hospitality and provision. The Gibeonites' claim is designed to evoke sympathy and trust from the Israelites. This phrase also highlights the importance of bread in biblical narratives, often symbolizing sustenance and life, as seen in the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>on the day we left to come to you</b><br>The Gibeonites emphasize the immediacy of their departure to reinforce their story of a long journey. This phrase is crucial in their deception, as it suggests urgency and a direct mission to seek peace with Israel. The context of <a href="/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a> shows the Gibeonites' fear of Israel's God and their desire to make a treaty to avoid destruction. This reflects the broader theme of God's reputation preceding the Israelites, as seen in Rahab's acknowledgment of God's power in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>.<p><b>But look, it is now dry and moldy</b><br>The transformation of the bread from warm to moldy serves as physical evidence to support the Gibeonites' claim of a long journey. This visual proof is intended to convince the Israelites of their story's authenticity. In a spiritual sense, the deterioration of the bread can symbolize the decay of human efforts and the futility of relying on deception rather than truth. The Israelites' failure to seek God's counsel in this matter (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>) serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of discernment and reliance on divine guidance. The moldy bread contrasts with the "bread of life" that Jesus offers, which never perishes (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeonites.htm">Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people from the city of Gibeon who deceived Joshua and the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them by pretending to be from a distant land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.
