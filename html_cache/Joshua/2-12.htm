This reflects the cultural practice of invoking a deity to guarantee the truthfulness and binding nature of an oath. Rahab's acknowledgment of the LORD suggests her faith in the God of Israel, contrasting with the Canaanite gods of her people. This moment foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant community, as seen in the New Testament with figures like Cornelius in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>.<p><b>that you will indeed show kindness to my family</b><br>The term "kindness" here is translated from the Hebrew word "hesed," which denotes loyal love or covenant faithfulness. Rahab's plea for her family's safety highlights the importance of familial bonds in ancient Near Eastern culture. This request for "hesed" mirrors God's covenantal love for Israel and prefigures the New Testament concept of grace extended to all believers, regardless of their background.<p><b>because I showed kindness to you</b><br>Rahab's actions in hiding the spies demonstrate her faith and allegiance to the God of Israel, despite her Canaanite background. Her kindness is a practical expression of her faith, aligning with <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>, which commends her for her works. This reciprocal kindness reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>, and underscores the importance of faith being accompanied by action.<p><b>Give me a sure sign</b><br>Rahab's request for a "sure sign" indicates her desire for assurance and security, a common practice in ancient covenants where signs or tokens were used to confirm agreements. This request can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament sacraments, such as baptism and communion, which serve as signs and seals of God's promises to believers. The scarlet cord later given to Rahab becomes a symbol of her faith and the salvation of her household, reminiscent of the Passover blood in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, which protected the Israelites from judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho, known for her occupation as a prostitute.

The verse highlights the seriousness of oaths, the beauty of steadfast kindness, and the certainty that God honors those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">Kindness.</span> The original is perhaps a little stronger, and involves usually the idea of mercy and pity. This, however, is not always the case (see <a href="/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>). "It had been an ill nature in Rahab if she had been content to be saved alone: that her love might be a match to her faith, she covenants for all her family, and so returns life to those of whom she received it," (Bp. Hall). <span class="cmt_word">A true token.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">a token of truth.</span> The construction is that in which the latter noun often stands in Hebrew for an adjective. Here, however, it would seem to be a little more, <span class="accented">a token of truth</span> - a pledge, that is, of sincerity. Rahab wanted some guarantee that her life and the lives of her kindred would be saved. The bare word of the spies would not suffice, for how could she and her kindred be identified in the confusion attending the sack of the city? But if the spies would agree upon some sign by which she could be recognised, it would at once be a pledge that they intended to keep their word, and a means of protection in the approaching downfall of the city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
