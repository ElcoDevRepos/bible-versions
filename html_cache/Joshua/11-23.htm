The "entire land" refers to the territories that were conquered under Joshua's leadership, which included key regions such as Jericho, Ai, and the southern and northern kingdoms. This conquest was a significant achievement, as it involved overcoming numerous fortified cities and diverse peoples. The phrase underscores Joshua's role as a faithful leader who executed God's commands, reflecting the divine mandate given to the Israelites to possess the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>).<p><b>in keeping with all that the LORD had spoken to Moses</b><br>This highlights the continuity of God's promises from Moses to Joshua. The LORD had assured Moses that the Israelites would inherit the land (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7-8</a>). Joshua's actions are seen as a direct fulfillment of these promises, demonstrating God's faithfulness and the importance of obedience to His word. This continuity also emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God's promises are realized through human agency.<p><b>And Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel</b><br>The distribution of the land as an inheritance signifies the transition from conquest to settlement. This act fulfilled the promise made to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:3, 28:13). The concept of inheritance is deeply rooted in the covenantal relationship, where the land is not merely a possession but a divine gift that signifies God's enduring commitment to His people. This inheritance also foreshadows the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><b>according to the allotments to their tribes</b><br>The division of the land among the tribes of Israel was conducted according to specific allotments, which were determined by casting lots (<a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55-56</a>). This method ensured that the distribution was perceived as divinely guided, reflecting God's sovereignty over the process. Each tribe received a portion of the land that corresponded to its size and needs, as outlined in the Book of Joshua (chapters 13-21). This tribal allotment system reinforced the unity and identity of the Israelite community.<p><b>Then the land had rest from war</b><br>This phrase indicates a period of peace following the extensive military campaigns led by Joshua. The "rest" from war symbolizes the completion of a significant phase in Israel's history, where the primary objective of conquering the land was achieved. This rest is not only physical but also spiritual, as it represents a time of fulfillment and divine blessing. It prefigures the ultimate rest found in Christ, who offers spiritual rest to believers (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>). The cessation of warfare allowed the Israelites to focus on establishing their society according to God's laws and commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land and conquering it as God commanded.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which God had promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promised the land to the Israelites and guided them in their conquest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The previous leader of Israel who received the promise from God regarding the land, which Joshua fulfilled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribal_allotments.htm">Tribal Allotments</a></b><br>The division of the Promised Land among the twelve tribes of Israel, as an inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_of_god.htm">Faithfulness of God</a></b><br>God's promises are sure and steadfast.

The verse celebrates the reliability of divine promises, the importance of obedient stewardship, and the peace that follows fulfilled obedience&#8212;truths that still anchor our faith and expectation today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joshua took the whole land.</span> The word must not be pressed to mean that every Canaanitish stronghold was razed or appropriated. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, as has been before remarked, has a very loose signification in Hebrew. What is meant is simply this. Joshua had established an unquestioned military preponderance in Palestine. He had broken down all resistance; but before he completed his conquests to their full extent, he had to provide for the peaceable settlement of the tribes in the territory he had seized. The complete extermination of the Canaanites formed no part of his commission or his plan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>; cf. <a href="/exodus/23-29.htm">Exodus 23:29, 30</a>). To have effected it would have been to throw the land out of cultivation, and to expose its possessors to the usual inconveniences of depopulated districts. Therefore it was Joshua's policy to leave the Canaanites to be extirpated by degrees, and to encourage the Israelites to cultivate the arts both of war and of peace; to nourish a martial spirit by remembering that numerous and active enemies still dwelt in their midst, while yet they were not neglectful of the importance of a settled and civilised, an agricultural and pastoral life. See also <a href="/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1, 2</a>. This purpose was defeated, not only by the usual effects of civilisation upon hardy or savage tribes, but also by the Israelites becoming addicted to the pleasant but enfeebling vices of the races they had supplanted. We see in the Israelitish history the best exemplification of St. Paul's theory that the "law worketh wrath," although it is "holy, just, and good." The excellence of the moral precepts delivered by Moses did but serve to manifest more clearly the inherent depravity of our nature (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7, 8</a>), and its need of a Saviour, who should render obedience possible by the gift of regeneration, and the infusion of His own Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">According to their divisions.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">their divisions by lot</span>, the word being derived from the same root as the word Halak in ver. 7, because a smooth stone was usually employed in casting lots. Hence it came to mean any authoritative division or distribution, as the courses of the Levites (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6</a>), the classification for purposes of enlistment (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1</a>) and the like. <span class="cmt_word">And the land rested from war.</span> That is to say, the Canaanites were so thoroughly cowed and dispirited that they dared offer no further resistance to the Israelites in their task of portioning out the land. They were quite contented to be allowed to live in peace in such of their cities which remained, and had no disposition to court an overthrow such as took place at the battles of Gibeon and Merom, with its inevitable results of the absolute extermination, not only of every one who took up arms, but of every human being in the city to which they belonged. Thus the Israelites were able to give their whole attention to the survey and apportionment of the territory according to the relative size and importance of the tribes. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/11-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1436;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
