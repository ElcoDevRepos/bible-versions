It reflects the Israelites' commitment to fulfilling God's promise of the land. The act of departing signifies a step of faith and action, reminiscent of Abraham's journey to a land he did not know (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). The land they are surveying is the Promised Land, a central theme in the Old Testament, representing God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>mapping it city by city into seven portions</b><br>The detailed mapping of the land city by city shows the importance of order and precision in the division of the land. This task was necessary to ensure each tribe received its rightful inheritance. The division into seven portions is significant, as the number seven often symbolizes completeness and divine perfection in the Bible (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). This process also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>Then they returned with the document to Joshua</b><br>The return to Joshua with the document signifies accountability and the completion of their task. Joshua, as the leader, represents a type of Christ, guiding and distributing the inheritance to God's people. The document serves as a legal and formal record, ensuring transparency and fairness in the distribution. This act of returning is akin to the faithful servant returning to the master with the talents multiplied (<a href="/matthew/25-20.htm">Matthew 25:20-21</a>).<p><b>at the camp in Shiloh</b><br>Shiloh holds historical and spiritual significance as the first major center of Israelite worship in the land of Canaan. It was the location of the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant, symbolizing God's presence among His people (<a href="/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>). Shiloh is also prophetically significant, as it is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> as a reference to the coming of the Messiah.

Joshua had just charged them, &#8220;Go and describe the land&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8</a>). Their prompt departure models the same readiness Abraham showed when he &#8220;rose early in the morning&#8221; to follow God&#8217;s word (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>). Genuine faith moves at the Lord&#8217;s command without delay, trusting His promises of inheritance first announced in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a> and reaffirmed in <a href="/exodus/23-30.htm">Exodus 23:30-31</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went throughout the land</b><p>They did not glance from a distance; they walked the breadth and length of Canaan just as God once told Abram, &#8220;Walk through the length and breadth of the land, for to you I will give it&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/13-17.htm">Genesis 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This thorough survey echoes the earlier mission of the twelve spies in <a href="/bsb/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, yet now it is done in faith, not fear.<p>&#8226; Their journey fulfilled God&#8217;s instruction that &#8220;the land shall be divided for you by lot as an inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/34-13.htm">Numbers 34:13</a>), requiring on-the-ground knowledge so every tribe could see the fairness of the upcoming allotment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mapping it city by city into seven portions</b><p>The text says they were &#8220;describing it in a book by cities into seven portions&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/18-9.htm">Joshua 18:9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;City by city&#8221; underscores meticulous attention; nothing was left vague. Fairness demands facts, and the Lord welcomes diligent stewardship (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Seven&#8221; signifies completeness in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). Every remaining tribe&#8212;Benjamin, Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan&#8212;would receive a fully surveyed inheritance, fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> where God &#8220;set the boundaries of the peoples.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Writing their findings &#8220;in a book&#8221; anticipates later generations needing a permanent record, just as Moses wrote God&#8217;s victories in a book (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>) and later placed the law &#8220;beside the ark&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they returned</b><p>Completion of the task brings them back to camp.

They did not rely on memory; they brought concrete evidence. Such transparency protects against dispute, fulfilling the principle that &#8220;every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). Written documentation also foreshadows the written covenant that would govern Israel (<a href="/joshua/24-26.htm">Joshua 24:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Joshua</b><p>Joshua, the Lord-appointed leader, receives their work.

By returning the survey to Joshua, the men reaffirmed God&#8217;s chosen order and the spiritual oversight required for the land division.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At the camp in Shiloh</b><p>Shiloh had just become Israel&#8217;s worship center: &#8220;The whole congregation&#8230; set up the Tent of Meeting there&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Conducting civil matters where God&#8217;s presence dwelt united worship and daily life.<p>&#8226; Shiloh&#8217;s central location made it an ideal, impartial meeting place, illustrating <a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>&#8217;s blessing when brothers dwell together in unity.<p>&#8226; By bringing the survey to the sanctuary&#8217;s doorstep, they acknowledged that the land grant was ultimately God&#8217;s gift, not mere human real estate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/18-9.htm">Joshua 18:9</a> shows obedient servants carrying out a careful, written survey so every tribe could inherit exactly what God promised.
