Judah holds a significant place in biblical history, as it is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ are descended. The allotment of land to Judah is a fulfillment of Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>, where Judah is promised leadership and prominence among his brothers. This allocation of land is part of the broader division of Canaan among the tribes of Israel, as commanded by God to Moses and executed by Joshua.<p><b>extended to the border of Edom</b><br>Edom is a region southeast of Judah, inhabited by the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. The relationship between Israel and Edom is complex, marked by both kinship and conflict. The border with Edom signifies the southernmost extent of Judah's territory. This boundary is significant as it represents the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites a land of their own, distinct from their neighbors, including Edom. The proximity to Edom also foreshadows future interactions and conflicts between the two nations, as seen in passages like <a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>.<p><b>to the Wilderness of Zin</b><br>The Wilderness of Zin is a desert region located in the southern part of Canaan. It is mentioned in the context of the Israelites' wilderness wanderings in <a href="/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a> and <a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>. The wilderness serves as a geographical marker for the southern boundary of Judah's territory. This area is characterized by its arid climate and sparse vegetation, which posed challenges for the Israelites during their journey to the Promised Land. The mention of the Wilderness of Zin highlights the vast and varied nature of the land allotted to Judah, encompassing both fertile areas and harsh desert regions.<p><b>at the extreme southern boundary</b><br>The phrase "extreme southern boundary" emphasizes the extent of Judah's territory, reaching the farthest southern limits of the land of Canaan. This boundary is significant as it delineates the portion of the land that God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The southern boundary also serves as a strategic defense line against potential threats from neighboring nations. The comprehensive description of Judah's borders in this passage underscores the importance of land inheritance in Israel's covenant relationship with God, as well as the fulfillment of divine promises regarding the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_judah.htm">Tribe of Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Leah.

Israel has crossed the Jordan, subdued hostile kings (<a href="/bsb/joshua/12.htm">Joshua 12</a>), and is settling the land &#8220;by lot&#8221; just as Moses commanded (<a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55-56</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1-2</a>). This allotment is not random chance; <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a> reminds us that &#8220;its every decision is from the LORD.&#8221; In other words, the boundaries about to be described flow directly from God&#8217;s covenant promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-17</a>) and reaffirm His faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the clans of the tribe of Judah</b><p>The focus tightens from the whole nation to Judah&#8217;s individual clans.

Giving this tribe its inheritance first highlights Judah&#8217;s preeminence and foreshadows the coming King who would arise from this line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-6</a>). Listing &#8220;clans&#8221; underscores that every family&#8212;large or small&#8212;has a defined place in God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>extended to the border of Edom</b><p>Judah&#8217;s territory stretches southward &#8220;to the border of Edom.&#8221; Edom, the nation descended from Esau (<a href="/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>), lay immediately beyond Israel&#8217;s southern frontier (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a>). This boundary kept the brothers&#8212;Jacob&#8217;s and Esau&#8217;s descendants&#8212;side by side yet distinct, honoring God&#8217;s earlier instruction not to seize Edomite land (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>).

God turns even a bleak desert into a landmark of promise fulfilled; land once associated with unbelief now becomes part of Judah&#8217;s secure inheritance (<a href="/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3-4</a>). The mention of Zin links past wanderings to present possession, declaring that years of discipline have culminated in rest (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-4</a>:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the extreme southern boundary</b><p>Finally, <a href="/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1</a> emphasizes that this allotment reaches &#8220;the extreme southern boundary.&#8221; <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a> had spoken of borders &#8220;from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines,&#8221; and <a href="/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3</a> pinpointed the &#8220;Southern border&#8221; in similar terms.

With it compare <a href="/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3-5</a>, which gives the southern border of the Israelitish territory, corresponding closely with this account of the southern border of Judah. The word <span class="accented">tribe</span> here is, as might be expected from the context <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Even to the border of Edom.</span> The literal translation, which makes the passage clearer, is, "the border of Edom, the wilderness of Zin towards the dry region (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) from the extreme limit of the south <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>. The latter of these words, derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> "right hand," being the position of the south when regarded from the point of view of a man looking eastward, denotes the southward <span class="accented">direction</span> (see above, <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>). The former word has reference to the physical conditions of the country, its heat and dryness. The LXX. does not attempt to translate the former word and has evidently <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness of Zin.</span> Not to be confounded with the wilderness of Sin (<a href="/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>; cf. <a href="/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>, 36). This wilderness was on the border of Edom (<a href="/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>). Thence the border of Judah (which here includes the small portion afterwards allotted to Simeon) extended to the utmost limits of the south (see <a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1, 9</a>). A wall of mountains extends southwestward from the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and formed the natural boundary of Judaea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/15-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the allotment</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
