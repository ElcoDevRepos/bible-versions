The command referenced here is found in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4-6</a>, where Moses instructs the Israelites to build an altar on Mount Ebal. This act of obedience underscores the continuity of leadership from Moses to Joshua and the importance of adhering to God's commands as a covenant people. It also highlights the role of Moses as a mediator of God's law, a type of Christ who mediates the New Covenant.<p><b>He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses:</b><br>The "Book of the Law of Moses" refers to the Pentateuch, particularly the legal and covenantal instructions found within. This phrase indicates that Joshua's actions were not arbitrary but were grounded in the written Word of God, emphasizing the authority and sufficiency of Scripture. It reflects the importance of Scripture as a guide for worship and life, a principle that is echoed throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's Word is described as a lamp and light.<p><b>&#8220;an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool has been used.&#8221;</b><br>The use of uncut stones for the altar signifies purity and the avoidance of human craftsmanship in sacred matters, symbolizing that worship should be free from human pride and manipulation. This command is rooted in <a href="/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>, where God instructs that altars should not be made with hewn stones, lest they be profaned. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, the "stone the builders rejected" (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>), who is perfect and unaltered by human hands.<p><b>And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD,</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and complete dedication to God. The offering being wholly consumed by fire represents total surrender and devotion. This practice points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself completely for the atonement of sin, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>.<p><b>and they sacrificed peace offerings.</b><br>Peace offerings, or fellowship offerings, were expressions of thanksgiving and communion with God, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>. These offerings symbolize reconciliation and the restoration of fellowship between God and His people. In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in Christ, who is our peace (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>) and through whom we have fellowship with God (1 <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>).

Each detail underscores that true worship arises from God&#8217;s Word, relies on His provision rather than human improvement, and culminates in restored fellowship with Him and with one another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded</span> (see <a href="/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4, 5</a>). Here, and in ver. 33, we find the writer making an extract from the Book of Deuteronomy. As has been before said, the natural explanation is that the Book of Joshua was written after the Book of Deuteronomy, and that the Book of Deuteronomy was written by Moses, or how could Joshua have carried out instructions which had never been given? The Elohist, Jehovist, and Denteronomist theory supposes the compiler of the Book of Joshua to have done his work in so perfunctory a fashion, that it is quite possible for critics living at a distance of three thousand years and more to detect the various fragments of which his mosaic is constructed. He is so void of common sense as to have inserted this narrative in a place so obviously unsuitable that it involves a palpable contradiction to probability and common sense, and this when he could have placed it in a dozen other parts of the book where no such improbability would be involved. Yet, in spite of the incredible carelessness with which he put his materials together, we are required to believe that "the Deuteronomist" had the foresight to insert the fulfilment of the command of Moses which he had invented in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26-30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-1.htm">Deuteronomy 27:1-26</a>; and that in so doing he abbreviated the narrative so as to leave out many details of his own invention. Now, under the supposition of a later fabrication of supplementary observances to be imposed upon the children of Israel, it is hardly probable that the account of the plaster with which the stones were to be plastered, and the enumeration of the tribes and the curses, would be omitted, since by the hypothesis the object of the Deuteronomist was to secure implicit obedience to the sacerdotal enactments he was inventing. But on the hypothesis of the genuineness of both writings everything fits in naturally enough. <span class="cmt_word">An altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron.</span> As though to intimate (see <a href="/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>) that all should be natural and spontaneous in the worship of God, and that as little of human devising should be introduced as possible. The altar must be raised by man, but the principles of the worship must not be devised by him. This interpretation, however, is rejected by Calvin, who thinks that all that was meant was to preclude the perpetual existence of the altar (though how the substitution of whole for hewn stones could effect this is not apparent); and Keil and Bahr ('Symbolik,' 1. pp. 487, 488),who think that the altar ought (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>) properly to be of earth, since sacrifice is rendered necessary by man's earthly or carnal nature, and that unhewn stone is the only substitute for earth which is allowed. But surely man's handiwork is the offspring of his unregenerate nature, and therefore may, from this point of view, be rightly employed in sacrifice. Hengstenberg ('Gesehichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 223) thinks that the reason of the command was that, since only one place of worship was permitted for all Israel, an altar had sometimes to be hastily thrown up. But when we consider the symbolic character of the Mosaic worship, we are compelled to reject this interpretation as unsatisfactory. Benjamin of Tudela (see Drusius <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) appears to have supposed that these stones were those which had been taken out of Jordan. Masius devotes considerable space to the refutation of this opinion (see also note on last verse). <span class="cmt_word">And they offered thereon.</span> Delitzsch remarks on the inversion of the order here, as compared with <a href="/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>. But this is obviously the true order. The worship would naturally precede the ceremony rather than follow it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/8-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">just as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
