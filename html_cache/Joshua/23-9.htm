The Israelites' victories over formidable nations such as the Amorites, Hittites, and Canaanites were not due to their own strength but were acts of God fulfilling His promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This reflects the covenantal faithfulness of God, as He had promised Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The phrase also underscores the theme of God as a warrior, a motif seen throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). Archaeological evidence, such as the destruction layers found in cities like Jericho and Hazor, supports the biblical narrative of conquest during this period.<p><b>and to this day no one can stand against you</b><br>This statement emphasizes the ongoing protection and favor of God over Israel. Historically, this period marks the establishment of Israel as a dominant force in the region, with surrounding nations unable to defeat them. The phrase "to this day" suggests a continued state of divine favor and security, which is a recurring theme in the Deuteronomic history. It also serves as a reminder of the conditional nature of this protection, as later texts reveal that Israel's disobedience leads to their eventual downfall (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-15</a>). This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides ultimate victory and security for believers, as no spiritual force can stand against those who are in Him (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31-39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>- The leader of Israel after Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land and is delivering his farewell address in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>- The covenant God of Israel, who has been faithful in fulfilling His promises to the Israelites by driving out their enemies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God, who have been given the land of Canaan as their inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>- The Promised Land, which the Israelites are in the process of fully possessing as God drives out the nations before them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_and_powerful_nations.htm">Great and Powerful Nations</a></b><br>- The various Canaanite tribes and peoples who occupied the land before the Israelites and were known for their strength and fortifications.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflect on how God has been faithful in fulfilling His promises to Israel.

The text underlines the reliability of promises first voiced to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18&#8211;21</a>) and reiterated to Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the LORD drove the nations out, Israel&#8217;s calling is to trust rather than tremble. Obedience becomes an act of confidence in proven divine power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>great and powerful nations</b><p>&#8226; These peoples were superior in size, fortification, and military skill (<a href="/numbers/13-28.htm">Numbers 13:28</a>). The Hittites, Amorites, and Canaanites fielded chariots and walled cities (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting their strength, the verse magnifies God&#8217;s greatness. What looked humanly impossible fell easily when confronted by divine might&#8212;echoing Gideon&#8217;s later lesson that &#8220;the LORD will deliver Midian into your hand with the three hundred men&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today meet &#8220;strongholds&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>), yet the same God remains unconstrained by earthly odds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before you</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s action is personal; He does not merely clear territory, He clears it &#8220;before you&#8221;&#8212;for the benefit of His covenant people.<p>&#8226; Earlier Moses declared, &#8220;The LORD your God will go before you; He will fight for you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a>). Joshua experienced that reality at Jericho when the ark circled the walls ahead of the army (<a href="/joshua/6-7.htm">Joshua 6:7&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also signals purpose: land possession served the larger goal of showcasing God&#8217;s name among the nations (<a href="/joshua/4-24.htm">Joshua 4:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to this day</b><p>&#8226; Joshua speaks near the end of his life, four or five decades after the first conquest. The victories were not fleeting; the security remained current.<p>&#8226; This ongoing preservation fulfills the promise &#8220;I will never leave you nor forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). Solomon later testifies, &#8220;Not one word has failed of all His good promises&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>).<p>&#8226; The line invites Israel to look backward for confidence about tomorrow. Gratitude fuels future faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no one can stand against you</b><p>&#8226; The statement reiterates an earlier pledge: &#8220;No man will be able to stand against you all the days of your life&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). God&#8217;s presence neutralizes resistance.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Stand&#8221; pictures an enemy holding ground; the verse asserts that opposition crumbles when confronting God-backed obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>).<p>&#8226; For Christians, this principle finds ultimate expression in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>&#8212;&#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221; The battle posture moves from fear to settled assurance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/23-9.htm">Joshua 23:9</a> celebrates completed victories, highlights God&#8217;s unmatched power, and calls God&#8217;s people to ongoing trust. The LORD Himself expelled formidable nations for Israel&#8217;s sake, proving that divine promises outlast human strength or opposition. Remembering those acts equips believers to obey courageously, confident that the same faithful God still goes before His people and renders every foe powerless to stand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">No man hath been able to stand before you.</span>--Comp. <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm" title="There shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you: I will not fail you, nor forsake you.">Joshua 1:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord your God hath driven out.</span> So the Masora and the LXX. The Vulgate and the margin of our version translate by the future. So Luther also. The next verse is undeniably future. An appeal to their experience, which did not fail (see <a href="/joshua/24-31.htm">Joshua 24:31</a>) to be effective as long as the memory of these things was fresh in their minds. So in the Prayer Book of the Church of England we find the appeal, "O God, we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have declared unto us, the noble works that thou didst in their days, and in the old time before them." And the passage (<a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1-3</a>), from which the idea of this petition is taken, is an allusion to this speech of Joshua. And we often, in times of faintheartedness or sloth, need to be thus reminded of the moral and spiritual victories of the true Israel, under the true Joshua the Saviour, over the enemies with whom we are forbidden to make a compromise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/23-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has driven out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;re&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
