Kohath was a son of Levi, making his descendants part of the tribe set apart for religious duties. The Kohathites had a special role in the tabernacle service, responsible for the most sacred objects, including the Ark of the Covenant. This phrase indicates that not all Kohathites were given the same allotment, as some had already received cities in Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.<p><b>received ten cities by lot</b><br>The allocation of cities by lot was a common practice in ancient Israel, believed to reflect divine will. This method ensured that the distribution was seen as fair and ordained by God. The number ten is significant, symbolizing completeness and order, suggesting that the Kohathites received a full and sufficient provision for their needs.<p><b>from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</b><br>These tribes were located in the central and northern regions of the Promised Land. Ephraim and Manasseh were sons of Joseph, and their tribes were among the most prominent in Israel. Dan was initially located in the central region but later moved to the north. The inclusion of the half-tribe of Manasseh refers to the division of this tribe, with half settling east of the Jordan River and half on the west. This allocation reflects the geographical spread and influence of the Kohathites, allowing them to serve the spiritual needs of a broad area. The connection to these tribes also highlights the unity and interdependence among the tribes of Israel, as the Levites were distributed throughout the land to teach and maintain the worship of Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohathite_clans.htm">Kohathite Clans</a></b><br>Descendants of Kohath, one of the sons of Levi.

Unlike their brothers the priests (the line of Aaron), this branch serves in tabernacle duties but does not offer sacrifices (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-16.htm">1 Chronicles 6:16&#8211;19</a>).<p>- Scripture treats this detail as historical fact; God really set aside a specific clan for sacred service, fulfilling earlier commands (<a href="/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>received ten cities</b><p>- God allotted forty-eight Levitical cities in total (<a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>), and this Kohathite subgroup received ten of them (<a href="/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26</a>).<p>- These towns functioned as bases of ministry, ensuring Israel always had teachers of the Law nearby (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>).<p>- Practical implications:<p>&#8226; The Levites lived among the people, modeling worship in daily life.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s inheritance remained balanced&#8212;no tribe was overburdened, yet every tribe benefited from Levite presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by lot</b><p>- &#8220;By lot&#8221; underscores God&#8217;s direct governance: &#8220;The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).<p>- Lots guaranteed impartiality (<a href="/joshua/18-6.htm">Joshua 18:6</a>).
