The hill country refers to the mountainous regions of Ephraim and Manasseh, which were part of the inheritance given to the tribes of Joseph. Historically, these areas were known for their strategic military advantage and fertile land. The assurance of ownership reflects God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to the Israelites, as seen in <a href="/genesis/48-21.htm">Genesis 48:21-22</a>, where Jacob blesses Joseph with a portion of land.<p><b>It is a forest; clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours.</b><br>The mention of a forest suggests that the land was undeveloped and required effort to make it habitable and productive. Clearing the forest symbolizes the need for diligence and hard work in claiming God's promises. This task also reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship and the responsibility to cultivate and manage God's creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>. The phrase "its farthest limits will be yours" emphasizes the extent of the inheritance, encouraging the Israelites to fully occupy and utilize the land.<p><b>Although the Canaanites have iron chariots and although they are strong,</b><br>Iron chariots were a significant military advantage in ancient warfare, representing the strength and technological superiority of the Canaanites. This detail highlights the formidable challenge faced by the Israelites. The Canaanites' strength is acknowledged, yet it serves as a reminder of the Israelites' reliance on God's power rather than their own. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/deuteronomy/20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>, where God reassures His people not to fear their enemies' might.<p><b>you can drive them out.&#8221;</b><br>This statement is a call to action and a declaration of victory. It underscores the theme of divine empowerment, where God enables His people to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The assurance of driving out the Canaanites aligns with God's covenant promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as seen in <a href="/exodus/23-30.htm">Exodus 23:30-31</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who empowers believers to overcome spiritual battles, as reflected in <a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>.<div

God enlarges Manasseh&#8217;s inheritance, yet calls them to clear forests and face formidable foes. The passage reassures believers that no obstacle&#8212;whether untamed terrain or iron-clad opposition&#8212;can nullify God&#8217;s pledge. Active obedience unlocks the full extent of His provision, proving that what He assigns, He equips His people to possess.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the mountain shall be thine, for it is a wood.</span> This passage makes it clear that it was not the whole territory of Mount Ephraim, but only the portion habitable at present, that was too small for Ephraim and Manasseh. When cleared it would afford them more space. But Joshua also recommends them to extend their operations beyond its borders, as is clear from the mention of the "plain," and the "chariots of iron" (see next note). <span class="cmt_word">The outgoings.</span> Not only the mountain itself, but the country to which the mountain passes led. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt drive out.</span> Perhaps <span class="accented">thou mayest drive out - i.e.</span>, it is in thy power. <span class="cmt_word">Though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.</span> "No weapon can prosper" against him who trusts in the Lord. Yet, in spite of the encouragement given by Joshua, the children of Joseph did not drive the Canaanites out, as vers. 11-13 show. The only reason of this was that they did not trust in Gad, but preferred an unworthy compromise with neighbours who, however rich in warlike material, were sunk in sensuality and sloth. Keil would render "because" for "though," and regard the very fact of the strength of the Canaanites as the reason that the sons of Joseph would subdue them. But <a href="/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-17.htm">Psalm 49:17</a> supply us with other instances of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. in the sense of although, which certainly is the best sense here. "Let it be remembered how long it was before the Saxons were firmly established in Britain, the Islamite Arabs in Egypt. Israel could look for no reinforcements from kindred left behind. So much the worse might afterwards be the position of the nation, left alone without hope of kindred auxiliaries to meet the repeated outbreaks of the half-subdued Canaanites" (Ewald, 'Hist. Israel,' 2 2. c.). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/17-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the hill country</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(har)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2022.htm">Strong's 2022: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mountain, hill, hill country</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;yeh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">yours as well.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
