This reflects the broader theme of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to the Israelites. The concept of inheritance is significant in biblical theology, symbolizing the blessings and rest that God provides to His people. Joshua's burial in his own inheritance underscores his role as a faithful servant who led Israel into the land God had promised to Abraham and his descendants.<p><b>at Timnath-serah</b><br>Timnath-serah, also known as Timnath-heres, was located in the territory of Ephraim. This city was given to Joshua as his inheritance (<a href="/joshua/19-49.htm">Joshua 19:49-50</a>). The name Timnath-serah means "portion of abundance," which may reflect the prosperity and blessing associated with Joshua's leadership. Archaeological evidence suggests that this area was inhabited during the Late Bronze Age, aligning with the biblical timeline of Joshua's life. The location serves as a testament to Joshua's leadership and the successful conquest of Canaan.<p><b>in the hill country of Ephraim</b><br>The hill country of Ephraim was a central region in the land of Israel, known for its rugged terrain and strategic importance. Ephraim was one of the prominent tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Ephraim. This area was significant in Israel's history, serving as a center for various events and leaders, including Samuel and the early monarchy. The choice of this location for Joshua's burial emphasizes his connection to the tribe of Ephraim and his role in establishing Israel in the Promised Land.<p><b>north of Mount Gaash</b><br>Mount Gaash is mentioned in connection with the burial of Joshua, though it is not frequently referenced elsewhere in Scripture. Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the vicinity of Timnath-serah. The mention of Mount Gaash provides a geographical marker that situates Joshua's burial site within the landscape of ancient Israel. This detail underscores the historical reality of the biblical narrative, grounding Joshua's story in a specific and identifiable location.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua was the leader of Israel after Moses.

For Timnath-Serah, see note on Joshua 19:50. The burial-place of Joshua has been supposed to be identified by the Palestine Exploration Committee. Lieutenant Conder describes what he saw at Tibneh. Amid a number of tombs he found one evidently, from more than 200 lamp niches on the walls of the porch, the sepulchre of a man of distinction. The simple character of the ornamentation, he thinks, and the entire absence of it in the interior of the tomb itself, not only suggest an early date, but are in harmony with the character of the simple yet noble-minded warrior, whose tomb it is supposed to be (see Quart. Paper, oct. 1873). In later papers, however (see Oct. 1877, and Jan. 1878), Lieutenant Conder abandons Tibneh for Kerr Haris, on the ground that Jewish tradition, usually found to be correct, is in its favour. And more mature reflection has induced him to modify his former opinion as to the early date of the tombs. Until these researches commenced, the situation of the hill Gaash was unknown, though it is mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/23-30.htm">2 Samuel 23:30</a> ("the brooks" or "valleys of Gaash"), and <a href="/1_chronicles/11-32.htm">1 Chronicles 11:32</a>. Nothing in these places serves to identify it. This passage is copied, with a few minute verbal discrepancies, into the Book of Judges (<a href="/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6-9</a>), a strong ground, according to all ordinary haws of literary criticism, for concluding that the latter book was written after the former. This is the chain of evidence by which the authenticity of the historical books of the Scriptures is established, not, of course, beyond the reach of cavil or dispute, but to the satisfaction of practical men. The LXX. as well as the Arabic translators have added here the following words: "There they placed with him in the sepulchre, in which they buried him there, the stone knives with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Gilgal, when he led them out from Egypt, as the Lord commanded, and they are there unto this day." This passage is not found in the Hebrew. And as the Arabic and the LXX. do not altogether agree, the probability seems to be that some apocryphal legend was inserted here at a very early date. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/24-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they buried</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
