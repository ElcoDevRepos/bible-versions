Rising early is often associated with diligence and devotion in Scripture, as seen in the lives of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and David (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>). It reflects Joshua's commitment to God's command and the importance of the task ahead.<p><b>Joshua got up and left Shittim</b><br>Shittim, also known as Abel-Shittim, was the last encampment of the Israelites before crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land. It is located in the plains of Moab, east of the Jordan. This departure marks a significant transition from the wilderness wanderings to the conquest of Canaan. Joshua's leadership is pivotal here, as he follows in the footsteps of Moses, leading the people into a new chapter of their history.<p><b>with all the Israelites</b><br>The inclusion of "all the Israelites" emphasizes the unity and collective movement of the nation. This was not just a military campaign but a spiritual journey for the entire community. The unity of the Israelites is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in their collective experiences throughout the Exodus and wilderness period.<p><b>They went as far as the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River represents a significant geographical and spiritual boundary. It is a natural barrier separating the Israelites from the Promised Land. Crossing the Jordan is symbolic of entering into God's promises and is often seen as a type of baptism or spiritual renewal, paralleling the Christian experience of entering into new life through Christ.<p><b>where they camped before crossing over</b><br>Camping before crossing the Jordan allowed the Israelites time for preparation and consecration, as detailed in the following verses. This pause signifies a moment of reflection and readiness before a major transition. It also connects to the theme of waiting on God's timing, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the Israelites' wait at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19). The crossing itself foreshadows the miraculous works of God, reminiscent of the Red Sea crossing, and points to the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.

The narrative moves right from the spies&#8217; report (<a href="/joshua/2-24.htm">Joshua 2:24</a>) to immediate action.<p>&#8226; Rising early reveals a heart eager to obey. Abraham did the same when called to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>), Moses when meeting Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/8-20.htm">Exodus 8:20</a>), and the Lord Jesus when withdrawing to pray (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently presents prompt obedience as the pattern of faith (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-12.htm">Joshua 6:12</a>). By placing this detail first, the Spirit highlights that decisive obedience precedes breakthrough.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joshua got up</b><p>&#8226; Leadership begins with personal responsiveness. Joshua does not delegate this first step; he rises himself. Compare Moses standing before the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>) and David hastening toward Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua&#8217;s name means &#8220;Yahweh is salvation,&#8221; foreshadowing Jesus who likewise leads His people into promise (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Both models show that godly leaders act, not merely speak (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and left Shittim with all the Israelites.</b><p>&#8226; Shittim had been the last long-term camp on the east side of the Jordan. It was also where Israel previously fell into sin with Moabite idolatry (<a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>). Leaving Shittim therefore pictures a clean break from past failures (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;All the Israelites&#8221; emphasizes corporate unity. No tribe lags behind (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>). Obedience is communal, not private.

Camping also positions everyone&#8212;young, old, strong, weak&#8212;to cross together (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>, principle of shared grace).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a> records deliberate, unified, and faith-filled movement toward God&#8217;s promise. Rising early shows eagerness; Joshua&#8217;s personal initiative models leadership; leaving Shittim marks repentance; standing at the Jordan confronts human limits; camping in expectancy cultivates consecration.

"This newes is brought but overnight, Joshua is on his way by morning, and prevents the sunne for haste. Delays, whether in the business of God or our owne, are hatefull and prejudiciall. Many a one loses the land of promise by lingering; if we neglect God's time, it is just with Him to crosse us in ours" (Bp. Hall). <span class="cmt_word">And they removed from Shittim.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">from the acacias</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> note on Joshua 2:1). To do this completely, and to be quite ready for the crossing, would, as Rosenmuller thinks, require the greater part of three days. But it adds that "they lodged (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) there before they passed over." But this need be no difficulty. The great mass of the people could easily leave the acacia meadows on the higher ground, and encamp on the brink of the Jordan, while the remaining two days might be spent in making the necessary arrangements for the crossing. For we must remember (as Keil observes) that, not only a body of armed men, but their women and children, and all their possessions, had to be led safely across. "Though they were not told how they should pass the river, yet they went forward in faith, having been told (<a href="/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a>), that they should pass it" (Matthew Henry). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Early the next morning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1436;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(bab&#183;b&#333;&#183;qer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
