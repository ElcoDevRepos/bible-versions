The context is the battle where Joshua prayed for the sun to stand still, allowing the Israelites more time to defeat their enemies. This highlights the extraordinary nature of God's intervention, which is unparalleled in biblical history. It underscores the idea that God's actions in history can be singular and unprecedented, reflecting His sovereignty and power.<p><b>when the LORD listened to the voice of a man</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the relationship between God and His chosen leader, Joshua. It shows that God is responsive to the prayers of His faithful servants, especially when they align with His divine will. This is a powerful reminder of the efficacy of prayer and the importance of faith. Theologically, it points to the concept of intercession, where human requests can influence divine action. This is seen in other biblical figures like Moses and Elijah, who also had significant interactions with God through prayer.<p><b>because the LORD fought for Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the central theme of divine intervention in the battles of Israel. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to be their protector and deliverer. Historically, this is consistent with the accounts of God fighting for Israel in other battles, such as the crossing of the Red Sea and the fall of Jericho. Theologically, it points to the idea of God as a warrior, a motif found throughout the Old Testament. This also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God through Jesus Christ, who fights and wins the spiritual battle against sin and death for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

God had parted the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21&#8211;31</a>), rained fire on Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24&#8211;25</a>), and would later reverse a shadow for Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8&#8211;11</a>), yet none of those acts receive this exact accolade.<p>&#8226; The emphasis is not only on the miracle&#8217;s scale but on its singular purpose: preserving Israel&#8217;s covenant advance exactly as promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; 15:18&#8211;21).<p>&#8226; By highlighting its uniqueness, the writer invites us to stand in awe, much like later psalmists who recounted God&#8217;s &#8220;wondrous works&#8221; to bolster faith (<a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>; 105:5).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when the LORD listened to the voice of a man</b><p>&#8226; Joshua spoke, and the Creator adjusted the cosmos (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>).

God&#8217;s intervention secured Israel&#8217;s victory over the Amorite coalition (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar language appears whenever God defends His people: &#8220;The LORD will fight for you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>) and &#8220;The battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). Each instance highlights grace&#8212;Israel wins because God fights.<p>&#8226; The clause frames the entire event as covenant faithfulness: the land must be conquered so Messiah&#8217;s line can be preserved (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).
