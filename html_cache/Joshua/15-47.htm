Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. / But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. / And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven?

It was strategically located near the coast, making it a significant trade and military hub. The mention of "towns and villages" indicates the surrounding settlements that were under Ashdod's influence. Historically, Ashdod was known for its worship of Dagon, a Philistine deity, which is evident in the account of the Ark of the Covenant being placed in the temple of Dagon (<a href="/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-7</a>). The city's inclusion in the territory of Judah signifies the extent of the land promised to Israel, although full control was not always realized due to ongoing Philistine resistance.<p><b>Gaza, with its towns and villages,</b><br>Gaza was another major Philistine city, known for its strength and fortifications. It was a key location on the trade route between Egypt and the Levant, contributing to its economic and strategic importance. The phrase "with its towns and villages" again highlights the broader region under Gaza's control. Biblically, Gaza is noted for its association with Samson, who was imprisoned and ultimately brought down the temple of Dagon there (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-30</a>). The city's mention in Joshua underscores the challenge Israel faced in fully possessing the land, as Gaza remained a Philistine stronghold for much of Israel's early history.<p><b>as far as the Brook of Egypt</b><br>The "Brook of Egypt" is generally identified with the Wadi El-Arish, a seasonal river marking the southwestern boundary of the Promised Land. This boundary delineates the extent of the land given to the tribe of Judah. The reference to this brook is significant in understanding the geographical limits of Israel's inheritance. It also serves as a reminder of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land his descendants would inherit (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<p><b>and the coastline of the Great Sea.</b><br>The "Great Sea" refers to the Mediterranean Sea, which formed the western boundary of the land allotted to Judah. This coastline was crucial for trade and interaction with other cultures, although it also exposed Israel to foreign influences and military threats. The inclusion of the coastline in the description of Judah's territory highlights the comprehensive nature of God's promise, encompassing diverse landscapes and resources. The sea also serves as a metaphor for the vastness of God's creation and the reach of His covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ashdod.htm">Ashdod</a></b><br>A significant Philistine city located in the coastal region of Canaan.

marks one of the key Philistine strongholds included in Judah&#8217;s western allotment (<a href="/joshua/15-46.htm">Joshua 15:46&#8211;47</a>).<p>&#8226; The list underscores God&#8217;s promise to provide ample territory (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Although physically handed to Judah, Ashdod later remained in Philistine hands because Israel did not fully drive them out (<a href="/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries later, kings such as Uzziah briefly subdued Ashdod (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), demonstrating what obedient leadership could accomplish.<p>&#8226; Prophets foretold Ashdod&#8217;s eventual judgment (<a href="/zechariah/9-6.htm">Zechariah 9:6</a>), confirming God&#8217;s authority over every city named.<p>Takeaway: The verse reminds believers that divine inheritance can be left unexplored if obedience is partial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gaza, with its towns and villages</b><p>&#8220;Gaza, with its towns and villages&#8221; highlights another border city.<p>&#8226; Gaza had been noted as far back as <a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>, showing the long history of the territory God now assigns to Judah.<p>&#8226; Joshua&#8217;s earlier sweep &#8220;from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/10-41.htm">Joshua 10:41</a>) proved God&#8217;s power to conquer even formidable cities.<p>&#8226; Later, Hezekiah &#8220;defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>), illustrating that faith-filled leaders could reclaim what God originally granted.<p>&#8226; Philip&#8217;s New-Testament meeting with the Ethiopian official &#8220;on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a>) reveals how God keeps using the same geography to advance His purposes.<p>Takeaway: God&#8217;s gifts are meant to be stewarded through every generation, from conquest to gospel mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As far as the Brook of Egypt</b><p>The phrase sets Judah&#8217;s southwestern limit: &#8220;as far as the Brook of Egypt&#8221;.<p>&#8226;

(<a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>), showing the boundary&#8217;s enduring relevance.<p>&#8226; Isaiah foresaw the day when the Lord would &#8220;gather you one by one, O children of Israel&#8230; from the River Euphrates to the Brook of Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>), reaffirming the literal borders still in His plan.<p>Takeaway: God marks borders with precision; every promise line on the map will be honored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The coastline of the Great Sea</b><p>Judah&#8217;s inheritance stretched to &#8220;the coastline of the Great Sea&#8221;, the Mediterranean.<p>&#8226;

The verse challenges believers to trust every word of Scripture, fully possess God&#8217;s gifts, and anticipate the day when Christ claims every promised inch for His glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/15-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ashdod,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1438;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;d&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_795.htm">Strong's 795: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ashdod -- a city of the Philistines</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with its towns</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1443;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124;
