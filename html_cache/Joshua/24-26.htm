The "Book of the Law of God" refers to the sacred writings that included the laws given to Moses. This act of recording signifies the importance of preserving God's commands and the people's promises for future generations. It reflects the continuity of divine revelation and the importance of written records in maintaining the covenant relationship. This practice of documentation is seen throughout the Pentateuch and highlights the role of Scripture in guiding the community of faith.<p><b>Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak</b><br>The setting up of a large stone serves as a physical and enduring witness to the covenant made between God and Israel. Stones were often used in ancient times as memorials or witnesses to significant events (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18, 31</a>:45-48). The oak tree mentioned here may have been a significant landmark or a place of gathering, adding to the solemnity of the occasion. The use of natural elements like stones and trees in covenant ceremonies underscores the permanence and seriousness of the commitments made.<p><b>that was near the sanctuary of the LORD.</b><br>The reference to the "sanctuary of the LORD" indicates the proximity to a sacred space, likely the tabernacle, which was the center of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. This location emphasizes the religious and spiritual significance of the covenant renewal. The sanctuary served as a constant reminder of God's holiness and the need for the Israelites to remain faithful to Him. The choice of this location for setting up the stone highlights the connection between the covenant and worship, as well as the centrality of God's presence in the life of the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

Its unchanging presence would remind future generations that their ancestors pledged wholehearted loyalty to the LORD (<a href="/joshua/24-22.htm">Joshua 24:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical reminders help safeguard against forgetfulness and drift, a principle echoed in the Lord&#8217;s Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24&#8211;26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Set it up there under the oak that was near the sanctuary of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Shechem&#8217;s oak had historical resonance&#8212;Abram built an altar there when God first promised the land (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6&#8211;7</a>), and Jacob buried foreign idols under an oak at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Placing the stone &#8220;near the sanctuary of the LORD&#8221; links the people&#8217;s oath to the very presence of God; the tabernacle was apparently stationed at Shechem for this covenant ceremony (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Oaks are long-lived; combining a durable tree with a sturdy stone underscores that God&#8217;s covenant and Israel&#8217;s responsibility endure.<p>&#8226; The location situates their promise within worship, not mere civic duty; every future visit to that sanctuary would confront Israel with the stone&#8217;s silent testimony (<a href="/joshua/24-27.htm">Joshua 24:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/24-26.htm">Joshua 24:26</a> shows Israel&#8217;s covenant renewal being sealed in two complementary ways: by written Scripture and by a visible stone witness. Recording the event in &#8220;the Book of the Law of God&#8221; affirms the authority and permanence of God&#8217;s Word, while erecting the stone beneath the historic oak near the sanctuary embeds their promise in the landscape of worship. Together these acts declare that obedience to the LORD must be remembered, recorded, and lived out before His enduring presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God.</span>--Primarily "these words" appear to refer to the transaction just recorded. But it must be observed that this is also the second signature among the sacred writers of the Old Testament. The first is that of Moses, in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm" title="And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.">Deuteronomy 31:9</a> : "Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests," &c. The next signature after Joshua's is that of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/10-25.htm" title="Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.">1Samuel 10:25</a>): "Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in the [not a] book, and laid it up before the Lord." We have here a clue to the authorship of the Old Testament, and to the view of the writers who succeeded Moses in what they did. They did not look upon themselves as writers of distinct books, but as authorised to add their part to the book already written, to write what was assigned to them "in the book of the law of God." The <span class= "ital">unity </span>of Holy Scripture is thus seen to have been an essential feature of the Bible from the very first.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua wrote these words.</span> Or, these <span class="accented">things</span>, since the word (see note on Joshua 22:24; 23:15) has often this signification. Joshua no doubt recorded, not the whole history of his campaigns and the rest of the contents of what is now called the Book of Joshua, but the public ratification of the Mosaic covenant which had now been made. This he added to his copy of the book of the law, as a memorial to later times. The covenant had been ratified with solemn ceremonies at its first promulgation (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>). At the end of Moses' ministry he once more reaffirmed its provisions, reminding them of the curses pronounced on all who should disobey its provisions, and adding, as an additional memorial of the occasion, the sublime song contained in <a href="/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>. (see <a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19, 22</a>). Joshua was present on this occasion, and the dying lawgiver charged him to undertake the conquest of the premised land, and to maintain the observance of the law among the people of God. Hitherto, however, God's promise had not been fulfilled. It seems only natural that when Israel had obtained peaceful possession of the land sworn unto their fathers, and before they were left to His unseen guidance, they should once more be publicly reminded of the conditions on which they enjoyed the inheritance. It may be remarked that, although Joshua's addendum to the book of the law has not come down to us, yet that it covers the principle of such additions, and explains how, at the death of Moses, a brief account of his death and burial should be appended by authority to the volume containing the law itself. The last chapter of Deuteronomy is, in fact, the official seal set upon the authenticity of the narrative, as the words added here were the official record of the law of Moses, having been adopted as the code of jurisprudence in the land. <span class="cmt_word">And took a great stone</span> (see notes on Joshua 4:2, 9).
