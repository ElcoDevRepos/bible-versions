The direction northward indicates a shift in the boundary line, which is significant in the precise delineation of tribal territories. This reflects the importance of land inheritance in Israelite society, as each tribe's portion was divinely ordained and crucial for maintaining tribal identity and heritage.<p><b>and proceeded to En-shemesh</b><br>En-shemesh, meaning "spring of the sun," is a location east of Jerusalem. Springs were vital in ancient times for water supply, and their mention often indicates a significant landmark. This site is associated with the boundary between Judah and Benjamin, highlighting the importance of natural features in defining territorial limits.<p><b>and on to Geliloth facing the Ascent of Adummim</b><br>Geliloth is a place whose exact location is uncertain, but it is thought to be near the border of Benjamin and Judah. The Ascent of Adummim, meaning "ascent of the red places," refers to a pass or slope characterized by red rock or soil. This area is near the road from Jericho to Jerusalem, a route that would later be significant in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30-37</a>), illustrating the enduring relevance of these locations.<p><b>and continued down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben</b><br>The Stone of Bohan is a landmark named after a member of the tribe of Reuben. This stone served as a boundary marker, emphasizing the importance of physical markers in ancient land division. The mention of Bohan, a Reubenite, underscores the interconnectedness of the tribes and the shared history of the Israelites, as Reuben's territory was east of the Jordan, yet his name is memorialized here.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/en_shemesh.htm">En Shemesh</a></b><br>A location mentioned in the boundary descriptions of the tribal allotments.
