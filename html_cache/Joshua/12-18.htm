It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, indicating its strategic importance. The city is identified with several archaeological sites, including Tel Afek near the Yarkon River. Historically, Aphek was a site of significant battles, such as those involving the Philistines and Israelites (<a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>). The mention of "one" king signifies the individual defeat of each king, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of Israel's conquest under Joshua. This reflects God's promise to give the land to the Israelites, fulfilling the covenant made with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>the king of Lasharon, one;</b><br>Lasharon is less well-known, and its exact location remains uncertain, though it is believed to be in the region of Canaan. The mention of Lasharon in this list underscores the thoroughness of the conquest, as even lesser-known cities and their rulers were subdued. This reflects the fulfillment of God's command to Joshua to conquer the land (<a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3-5</a>). The listing of these kings serves as a testament to God's faithfulness in delivering the promised land to the Israelites, demonstrating His sovereignty over all nations. The singular mention of each king highlights the individual accountability and the complete victory achieved by Israel under divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_aphek.htm">King of Aphek</a></b><br>Aphek was a city located in the northern part of ancient Israel, often associated with various battles in the Old Testament.

By noting &#8220;one&#8221; king, Joshua emphasizes that even a ruler seated in a fortified, militarily important city fell before the Lord&#8217;s advancing people.<p>- The victory fulfills God&#8217;s earlier promise: &#8220;He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall wipe out their name from under heaven&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>).<p>- It underscores that Israel&#8217;s success did not hinge on its own strength but on the Lord who &#8220;gave them into the hand of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8</a>).<p>- Each single tally reminds us of God&#8217;s personal accounting&#8212;no enemy, however entrenched, is overlooked (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The king of Lasharon, one</b><p>Lasharon likely lay in the fertile Sharon region, famed for its lush beauty (<a href="/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>).
