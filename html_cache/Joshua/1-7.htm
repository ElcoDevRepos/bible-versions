The phrase "be strong and very courageous" is repeated multiple times in the opening chapter of Joshua, underscoring its importance. This strength is not merely physical but also spiritual and moral, reflecting a reliance on God's presence and promises. The call to courage is rooted in the assurance of God's support, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6-8</a>, where Moses encourages Joshua with similar words. The context of entering the Promised Land, a place filled with formidable enemies, necessitates such courage.<p><b>Be careful to observe all the law that My servant Moses commanded you.</b><br>This directive highlights the centrality of the Mosaic Law in the life of Israel. Joshua is instructed to adhere strictly to the commandments given through Moses, which are detailed in the Torah, particularly in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The law serves as a covenantal guide for the Israelites, outlining their relationship with God and each other. Observance of the law is crucial for maintaining the nation's identity and ensuring God's continued favor. This mirrors the emphasis on obedience found in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32-33</a>, where adherence to God's commands is linked to life and prosperity.<p><b>Do not turn from it to the right or to the left,</b><br>This phrase signifies the importance of unwavering commitment to God's law. The imagery of not turning to the right or left suggests a straight path, symbolizing faithfulness and consistency in following God's commands. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>, which advises staying on the path of righteousness. The historical context involves the temptation to adopt the practices and gods of surrounding nations, which could lead Israel astray. The call to steadfastness is a reminder of the need for single-minded devotion to God.<p><b>so that you may prosper wherever you go.</b><br>The promise of prosperity is contingent upon obedience to God's law. In the biblical context, prosperity encompasses not only material success but also spiritual well-being and fulfillment of God's promises. The Hebrew understanding of prosperity includes peace, security, and flourishing in the land. This conditional promise is consistent with the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where obedience leads to blessings and disobedience to curses. The assurance of prosperity wherever Joshua goes reflects God's faithfulness to His covenant and His desire for Israel's success in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the leader of the Israelites after Moses.
