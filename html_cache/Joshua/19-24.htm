Geographically, Asher's territory was located in the northern part of Canaan, along the Mediterranean coast, which provided strategic trade routes and access to maritime resources. Historically, Asher struggled with fully driving out the Canaanite inhabitants, which led to periods of idolatry and conflict (<a href="/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31-32</a>).
