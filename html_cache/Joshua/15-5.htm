It is the lowest point on Earth's surface and is characterized by its high salinity, which prevents most marine life from thriving. In biblical times, the Salt Sea marked the eastern boundary of the tribe of Judah's inheritance. This boundary was significant as it separated the land of Israel from the territories to the east, such as Moab and Ammon. The Salt Sea is also associated with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, as mentioned in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, symbolizing God's judgment.<p><b>as far as the mouth of the Jordan.</b><br>The mouth of the Jordan refers to the point where the Jordan River flows into the Dead Sea. The Jordan River is a central waterway in the biblical narrative, symbolizing transition and purification. It was the site where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 3-4) and where John the Baptist later baptized Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). The river's mouth serves as a natural demarcation line, emphasizing the completion of the eastern boundary of Judah's territory.<p><b>The northern border started from the bay of the sea</b><br>The bay of the sea likely refers to the northernmost part of the Dead Sea, where the Jordan River enters. This area would have been a strategic location, providing access to water resources and serving as a natural defense line. The northern border's starting point at this bay highlights the importance of water bodies in defining territorial boundaries in ancient times. It also underscores the connection between the land and the covenant promises given to the Israelites, as the land was a tangible sign of God's faithfulness.<p><b>at the mouth of the Jordan,</b><br>Reiterating the mouth of the Jordan as a boundary point emphasizes its significance in the territorial delineation of the tribes of Israel. This location not only served as a geographical marker but also held spiritual importance. The Jordan River was a site of miraculous events, such as the parting of its waters for the Israelites' crossing and the healing of Naaman the leper (<a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>). The river's mouth, therefore, represents both a physical and spiritual threshold, marking the transition from wilderness wandering to the inheritance of the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/salt_sea.htm">Salt Sea (Dead Sea)</a></b><br>A significant body of water in the region, known for its high salinity.

(<a href="/joshua/15-5.htm">Joshua 15:5</a>a).<p>&#8226; This statement fixes Judah&#8217;s frontier along the Salt Sea&#8212;known today as the Dead Sea&#8212;up to the point where the Jordan River empties into it. <a href="/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3&#8211;4</a> had earlier predicted this same line for Israel&#8217;s southern boundary, underscoring God&#8217;s consistency in parceling out the land.<p>&#8226; By naming recognizable landmarks (the sea and the river&#8217;s mouth), the text grounds Judah&#8217;s inheritance in geography that can be traced even now. <a href="/psalms/74-16.htm">Psalm 74:16&#8211;17</a> celebrates the Lord who &#8220;set all the boundaries of the earth,&#8221; reminding us He stakes out territory with sovereign precision.<p>&#8226; The Dead Sea&#8217;s lifeless waters stand in stark contrast to the fertile hills westward, a vivid illustration that blessing or barrenness hinges on obedience to God&#8217;s placement (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Placing the border here also secures Judah&#8217;s access to a natural defensive barrier. <a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29</a> shows God&#8217;s people protected by water before; now He grants a permanent watery rampart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The northern border started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan</b><p>&#8220;The northern border started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan&#8221;

This same spot later defines Benjamin&#8217;s southern edge (<a href="/joshua/18-15.htm">Joshua 18:15</a>), proving each tribe&#8217;s lot fits together like puzzle pieces in God&#8217;s larger design.<p>&#8226; Because the Jordan marked entry into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>), its mouth recalls the miracle of crossing&#8212;a boundary that once parted now becomes a border to keep.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a> foretells a future allotment with the Jordan as &#8220;the eastern boundary,&#8221; indicating God&#8217;s unchanging use of the river as a marker through redemptive history.<p>&#8226; The clear delineation of territory curbs potential disputes. <a href="/proverbs/22-28.htm">Proverbs 22:28</a> warns against moving ancient boundary stones; here the Lord Himself sets them, inviting His people to honor what He has drawn.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/15-5.htm">Joshua 15:5</a> records precise, God-appointed borders for Judah: east along the Salt Sea up to the Jordan&#8217;s mouth, then turning north from that very bay. These divinely fixed lines fulfill earlier promises, provide natural protection, and knit Judah&#8217;s inheritance into the broader tapestry of Israel&#8217;s land. By anchoring spiritual promise in concrete geography, the verse invites trust that the Lord who measured Judah&#8217;s borders also faithfully orders every boundary of our lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Their border in the north quarter.</span>--This can be followed with the Ordnance Survey of Palestine, and is described by Conder in the following way:--"It started from the Jordan mouth, but did not apparently follow the river, as Beth Arabah (unknown) and Beth Hogla (<span class= "ital">'Ain Hajlah, </span>about two miles west of Jordan--sheet 18) belonged to Benjamin. Passing along the valley of Achor (<span class= "ital">Wady Kelt</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>it left Gilgal on the north, and ascended the pass to the going up of Adummim (<span class= "ital">Tal'at-ed-Dumm</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the ancient and modern name 'bloody' being apparently derived from the brick-red marls here found amid a district of white chalk." (It is easy to conjecture other reasons.) A line of Roman road on the map is a very fair guide to the boundary here described, and thus far it lies on sheet 18 En Rogel, the next known point (on sheet 17), close to Zoheleth (Zahweileh, <a href="/1_kings/1-9.htm" title="And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brothers the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:">1Kings 1:9</a>), was evidently the present spring <span class= "ital">'Ain Umm-ed-Deraj, </span>in the Kedron Valley (this may be sought in the separate survey of Jerusalem, which is upon a larger scale). Thence the border ran across the slope (Cataph, <a href="/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>, "side"), beside the valley of Ben Hinnom (<span class= "ital">Wady Rababy</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>south of Jebus, and thus reached the watershed. (Here the boundary-line takes a turn to the northward.) It then apparently passed along the broad vale (Emek, <a href="/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>) of Rephaim ("valley of the giants"), which Josephus makes to extend towards Bethlehem. This valley is identified with <span class= "ital">El-Bukeia </span>(sheet 17).
