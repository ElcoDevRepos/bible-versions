The tribe of Benjamin, named after Jacob's youngest son, held a significant position among the tribes of Israel. Benjamin was the only son born in the Promised Land, and his tribe was known for its warriors (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>). The allocation of land by lot underscores the divine sovereignty in the distribution of the land, as God had promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Benjamin's territory would later become strategically important, as it included Jerusalem, the future capital of Israel.<p><b>Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph:</b><br>Geographically, Benjamin's land was a buffer zone between the powerful tribes of Judah to the south and Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) to the north. This location was significant for several reasons. It placed Benjamin at the crossroads of major trade routes, contributing to its economic and military importance. Historically, this central position also meant that Benjamin often played a pivotal role in the political dynamics of Israel, as seen in the stories of King Saul, a Benjamite, and the later division of the kingdom (<a href="/1_samuel/9.htm">1 Samuel 9:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-21.htm">1 Kings 12:21</a>). Theologically, the placement of Benjamin between Judah and Joseph can be seen as a type of Christ, who unites the divided people of God, as Benjamin's territory would later include Jerusalem, the city of peace and the site of the temple, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jacob and Rachel, Benjamin is the progenitor of the tribe that bears his name.

No wiser method could have been devised to secure an united Israel than thus to make Benjamin the link between the two most powerful and naturally rival tribes. In the story of Joseph, the brethren are reconciled through the mutual affection of Judah and Joseph for Benjamin as their father's youngest and best-loved son.<p>The position thus given to Benjamin under Joshua was still further developed by circumstances. The tribe was almost exterminated in the time of the judges; the survivors were united in marriage with women of Ephraim and Manasseh (?). On the other hand, the city of Jerusalem, although assigned by Joshua to Benjamin, was first a joint possession of Judah and Benjamin (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-28.htm" title="These were heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief men. These dwelled in Jerusalem.">1Chronicles 8:28</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-32.htm" title="And Mikloth begat Shimeah.

The selection of the first king of Israel from Benjamin, and the ultimate planting of the religious and political centre of all the tribes on the confines of Judah and Benjamin in Jerusalem, would have been two masterstrokes of policy if they had been schemes of man's devising. They were really links in the long chain of God's providential dealing with the chosen people.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">And their border.</span>--This is first described on the north side, where it coincided with the southern border of Ephraim.
