The law given through Moses included moral, ceremonial, and civil instructions that were meant to set Israel apart as God's chosen people. The call to be "very careful" underscores the seriousness with which the Israelites were to approach their covenant obligations. This reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience as a demonstration of faith and commitment to God.<p><b>to love the LORD your God,</b><br>Loving God is a foundational commandment in the Hebrew Scriptures, encapsulated in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which Jesus later affirmed as the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-38</a>). This love is not merely emotional but involves a deep commitment and loyalty to God, reflecting His covenantal love for His people. It is a call to prioritize God above all else, aligning one's heart and actions with His will.<p><b>to walk in all His ways,</b><br>Walking in God's ways implies living a life that reflects His character and commands. It suggests a daily, ongoing relationship with God, characterized by righteousness, justice, and mercy. This phrase echoes the call to holiness found throughout Scripture, where believers are urged to imitate God's attributes (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>). It also points to the journey of faith, where one's life path is directed by divine guidance.<p><b>to keep His commandments,</b><br>Keeping God's commandments involves both knowing and doing what God has instructed. This obedience is a tangible expression of love for God (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The commandments serve as a guide for living in a way that pleases God and benefits the community. This phrase highlights the continuity of God's moral expectations from the Old Testament to the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills and deepens the understanding of the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-20</a>).<p><b>to hold fast to Him,</b><br>Holding fast to God suggests a steadfast, unwavering commitment, especially in the face of challenges or temptations. It conveys the idea of clinging to God as one's source of strength and security. This phrase is reminiscent of the covenantal language used throughout the Bible, where God promises to be faithful to His people, and they are called to remain faithful to Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>).<p><b>and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.</b><br>Serving God with all one's heart and soul indicates total devotion and dedication. It involves not only external actions but also internal attitudes and motivations. This comprehensive service is a response to God's love and grace, reflecting the holistic nature of worship that encompasses every aspect of life. The call to serve God wholeheartedly is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to offer themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

His first words are a loving warning: &#8220;But be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you.&#8221; The call is not casual; it is urgent vigilance. Obedience to God&#8217;s revealed Word is the unshakable foundation of covenant life.<p>&#8226; Joshua had received the same charge in <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7&#8211;8</a>: &#8220;Be strong and very courageous.

Each facet reinforces the others: true love leads to walking; walking requires command-keeping; command-keeping is sustained by clinging to God; clinging naturally expresses itself in joyful service. This verse distills covenant life with God&#8212;then and now&#8212;into one seamless, all-embracing devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But take diligent heed.</span> This passage is a quotation from the Book of Deuteronomy (<a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-13.htm">Joshua 11:13, 22</a>; 30:6, 16, 20, etc.) The expressions, as Keil well remarks, are "crowded together, so that obedience to God's commands may be the more deeply impressed on their hearts." It is worthy of remark, that while beginning with the love of God, Joshua does not end there. The best proof of love is our conduct towards the person loved. If love be genuine, it is the practical principle which produces diligent service, punctual obedience, faithful attachment, the devotion of the heart and soul. <span class="cmt_word">Commandment and law.</span> The first of these words, derived from a root signifying to <span class="accented">set up</span>, has rather the force of what we call a <span class="accented">positive</span> precept, referring to single acts. The word translated <span class="accented">law</span>, derived from the root to <span class="accented">cast</span>, hence to stretch out the hand, to point out, refers rather to <span class="accented">moral</span> precepts. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and our <span class="accented">law</span> are used in the same sense. <span class="cmt_word">Cleave unto Him.</span> The Hebrew is stronger, cleave <span class="accented">into</span> Him, as though regarding not so much isolated actions as principles of life. Our life was to be "rooted and grounded," to use an apostolic phrase, in His. But the full significance of these words could not be understood till One had come who enabled us by faith to "eat His flesh and drink His blood," and so be united to Him as the branch to its root. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/22-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1511;
