The tribe of Judah is significant as it is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come. This selection process reflects the communal nature of sin and accountability in Israelite society, where the entire community is affected by the actions of one member. The process of bringing the clans forward indicates a methodical approach to identifying the guilty party, emphasizing the seriousness of sin and the need for purification.<p><b>and the clan of the Zerahites was selected</b><br>The Zerahites are descendants of Zerah, one of the sons of Judah and Tamar. This selection narrows down the search for the transgressor, showing the divine guidance in the process. The Zerahites' mention highlights the importance of lineage and family in Israelite culture, where one's actions could bring honor or dishonor to their entire clan. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty in choosing and revealing His purposes through specific individuals and families.<p><b>He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward</b><br>This further step in the selection process underscores the thoroughness and fairness in dealing with sin. It reflects the biblical principle that God sees and knows all, and nothing is hidden from Him. The public nature of this process serves as a deterrent to sin and a reminder of the communal responsibility to uphold God's commandments.<p><b>and the family of Zabdi was selected</b><br>Zabdi is identified as the head of the family from which Achan, the transgressor, comes. This selection highlights the biblical theme of individual responsibility within the community. The identification of Zabdi's family shows the precision of God's justice and the importance of dealing with sin at its root. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the need for repentance and restoration. The narrative foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Christ, who would bear the sin of many and restore the broken relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.
