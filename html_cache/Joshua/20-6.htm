The cities of refuge were established by God through Moses (<a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-15</a>) and were strategically located throughout Israel to be accessible to all. This provision underscores the value of human life and the importance of justice tempered with mercy.<p><b>until he stands trial before the assembly</b><br>The assembly refers to the local congregation or elders who would hear the case of the manslayer. This trial was necessary to determine whether the killing was accidental or premeditated. The process reflects the judicial system established in Israel, which emphasized fairness and the rule of law (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-12.htm">Deuteronomy 19:12</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment before God, where every deed is weighed.<p><b>and until the death of the high priest serving at that time</b><br>The high priest held a significant role in Israel as the spiritual leader and mediator between God and the people. His death marked a transition and provided a form of atonement, allowing the manslayer to return home. This provision highlights the concept of substitutionary atonement, a theme that is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our High Priest, whose death provides ultimate redemption and freedom from sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<p><b>Then the manslayer may return to his own home</b><br>The return to one's home signifies restoration and reconciliation. It indicates that the period of refuge was temporary and served its purpose in protecting the manslayer from the avenger of blood. This return is symbolic of the believer's reconciliation with God through Christ, who provides a permanent refuge and restores us to our intended place in His family (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>).<p><b>in the city from which he fled.</b><br>The city from which the manslayer fled represents his original community and life. The ability to return signifies the restoration of relationships and the reintegration into society. This mirrors the biblical theme of exile and return, seen throughout Scripture, where God&#8217;s people are often exiled due to sin but are promised restoration and return through repentance and God&#8217;s grace (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_manslayer.htm">The Manslayer</a></b><br>An individual who has unintentionally killed someone and seeks refuge in a city of refuge to avoid revenge from the avenger of blood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_refuge.htm">City of Refuge</a></b><br>Designated cities where those who committed unintentional manslaughter could seek asylum and be protected from the avenger of blood until a fair trial.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>The group of elders or leaders who would conduct the trial to determine the manslayer's fate.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The religious leader whose death marked the end of the manslayer's required stay in the city of refuge, allowing them to return home.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_avenger_of_blood.htm">The Avenger of Blood</a></b><br>A family member of the deceased who sought to avenge the death, according to ancient customs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_mercy.htm">Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The cities of refuge illustrate God's balance of justice and mercy.

It was no object of the Jewish law to make a man a victim to passion. <span class="cmt_word">Until the death of the high priest.</span> The further to protect the unwitting homicide from the consequences of an unjust revenge, he was, if innocent, to return to the city of refuge, and to dwell there until there was reasonable ground to suppose that the anger of the relatives of the slain man should have abated. This is clear from <a href="/numbers/35-24.htm">Numbers 35:24, 25</a>. Why the period of the death of the high priest should have been fixed upon is not easy to explain. Keil thinks it is because the death of the high priest was typical of the death of Christ, and refers to <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14, 15</a>. But the reference is not to the point. The high priest's death was in no sense typical of the death of Christ. His yearly entrance into the holy place once a year, on the Day of Atonement, was so typical. It might have been supposed that this yearly atonement would have been regarded as a propitiation for all the sins committed during the year. Certainly the fact that the high priest died the common death of all men, and the inauguration of his successor to fill his place could in no way be regarded as an atonement for sin. There is more force in Bahr's suggestion in his 'Symbolik' (2:52). The high priest, on this view, is the head of the theocracy, the representative of the covenant. He concentrates in his person (so Bahr puts it in another place - see vol. 2:13) the whole people of Israel in their religious aspect. His death, therefore, stands in a connection with the life of Israel which that of no other man could do. "It is," says Maimonides ('Moreh Nevochim,' 3.40), "the death of the most honoured and beloved man in all Israel. His death plunges the whole community into such distress that private sorrow is lost in the general affliction." Thus the covenant in a way recommences with the inauguration of the new high priest. Bahr complains that Philo has carried this view to an extravagant and fanciful extent. Hengstenberg ('Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' vol. 2, sec. 3, p. 258) takes the same view as Maimonides, that the high priest's death was "a great calamity," affecting the whole nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/20-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He is to stay</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1443;&#1489;
