Yes (Joshua 10:23, 40) No (Joshua 15:63)</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Joshua 18:16 Mean</div><b>Foot of the hill that faces the Valley of Ben-hinnom</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Then it went down to the foot of the hill that faces the Valley of Ben-hinnom&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>) marks the shift from elevated ground west of Jerusalem into the steep ravine south of the city.<p>&#8226; This identifies a literal topographical marker for Benjamin&#8217;s southern border, echoing the same physical feature described earlier for Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;Valley of Ben-hinnom&#8221; later becomes infamous for idolatrous child sacrifice (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). At this stage, however, it is simply a fixed, God-ordained boundary line, underscoring that geography itself belongs to the Lord (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Northern end of the Valley of Rephaim</b><p>&#8226; The border touches &#8220;the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim,&#8221; a fertile plain southwest of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Rephaim means &#8220;giants,&#8221; reminding readers of earlier battles where God gave victory over formidable foes (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Positioning Benjamin&#8217;s territory just north of this valley places the tribe strategically between Judah to the south and Ephraim to the north, fulfilling God&#8217;s orderly allotment promised in <a href="/numbers/34-13.htm">Numbers 34:13</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Down the Valley of Hinnom toward the southern slope of the Jebusites</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;And ran down the Valley of Hinnom toward the southern slope of the Jebusites.&#8221; The Jebusites controlled Jerusalem until David captured it (<a href="/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of their &#8220;southern slope&#8221; shows that, although the city itself lay just outside Benjamin&#8217;s inheritance, the tribe bordered it closely, giving Benjamin partial oversight of key approaches to Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; The double reference to Hinnom (Ben-hinnom/Hinnom) in this verse highlights a continuous descent, emphasizing how the land&#8217;s contours naturally guided the boundary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Downward to En-rogel</b><p>&#8226; The line ends &#8220;downward to En-rogel,&#8221; a perennial spring southeast of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17</a>).<p>&#8226; En-rogel served as a gathering point during several pivotal events, including Adonijah&#8217;s attempted coronation (<a href="/1_kings/1-9.htm">1 Kings 1:9</a>), showing its importance as a landmark.<p>&#8226; Its inclusion fixes the southernmost tip of Benjamin&#8217;s border before the line turns east toward the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a>), demonstrating God&#8217;s precise care in assigning heritage to every tribe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a> traces the southern border of Benjamin in four descending stages&#8212;from a hill west of Jerusalem, past the notorious Valley of Ben-hinnom, skirting the northern edge of Rephaim, sliding along the Jebusite slope, and finally reaching the spring of En-rogel. Each landmark is literal, confirming Scripture&#8217;s historical accuracy, and each reminds us that God sovereignly parcels out land, positions His people, and weaves future redemptive events into present geography.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/18-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [it]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
