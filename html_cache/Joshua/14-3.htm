This event is detailed in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>, where these tribes requested to settle in the fertile lands of Gilead and Bashan, east of the Jordan River, because they were suitable for their large herds. Moses initially hesitated, fearing a repeat of the rebellion at Kadesh Barnea, but he agreed after they promised to help the other tribes conquer the land west of the Jordan. This allocation fulfilled part of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land his descendants would inherit (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>But he granted no inheritance among them to the Levites.</b><br>The Levites were set apart for religious duties and service to the Tabernacle, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>. They were not given a specific territory like the other tribes but were instead provided with cities scattered throughout Israel (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>). This arrangement emphasized their role as spiritual leaders and mediators between God and the people. Their inheritance was the Lord Himself, symbolizing a deeper spiritual truth that points to the New Testament concept of believers being a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).

It explains why there was still ample land west of the Jordan to allocate.<p>&#8226; It also highlights the unity of Israel despite geographic separation. Though two and a half tribes settled east of the Jordan, they remained bound by covenant obligations (<a href="/joshua/22-1.htm">Joshua 22:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he granted no inheritance among them to the Levites</b><p>&#8226; Moses obeyed God&#8217;s directive that the Levites would not receive a territorial allotment (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). Instead, their &#8220;inheritance&#8221; was the LORD Himself and the privilege of serving at the tabernacle.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14</a> repeats this principle: &#8220;But to the tribe of Levi, Moses had given no inheritance; the offerings made by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Practically, the Levites were given forty-eight cities scattered throughout the tribes (<a href="/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1-42</a>). This distribution kept priests near the people they were called to teach and bless (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the arrangement underscored dependence on God rather than land for security&#8212;foreshadowing believers&#8217; identity as &#8220;a royal priesthood&#8221; whose ultimate inheritance is Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/14-3.htm">Joshua 14:3</a> reminds us why the land west of the Jordan was being divided only among nine and a half tribes: Moses had already settled two and a half tribes east of the river, while the Levites looked to the LORD Himself as their portion. The verse reinforces God&#8217;s faithfulness to earlier promises, the cohesiveness of the nation despite differing inheritances, and the call to prize fellowship with God above material possession.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/14-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had given</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1448;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5159.htm">Strong's 5159: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something inherited, occupancy, an heirloom, an estate, patrimony, portion</span><br /><br /><span class="word">east of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1430;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7687;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
