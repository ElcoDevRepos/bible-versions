Gilgal, located near the Jordan River, served as the Israelites' base camp after crossing into the Promised Land. This location is significant as it was the first place they camped after the miraculous crossing of the Jordan, symbolizing a new beginning and God's faithfulness. The march demonstrates strategic military planning and reliance on God's guidance, as Joshua responds to the Gibeonites' plea for help. The all-night journey reflects the urgency and dedication required to fulfill God's commands, reminiscent of the Israelites' previous experiences of divine intervention and guidance.<p><b>Joshua caught them by surprise</b><br>The element of surprise was crucial in ancient warfare, and Joshua's ability to catch the Amorite coalition off guard highlights his tactical acumen. This surprise attack underscores the theme of divine assistance, as God had promised Joshua victory over his enemies. The Amorites, confident in their alliance and fortified positions, were unprepared for such a swift and decisive move. This event parallels other biblical accounts where God grants victory to His people against overwhelming odds, such as Gideon's victory over the Midianites. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, achieved through unexpected means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, and a faithful servant of God.
