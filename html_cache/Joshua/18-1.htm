Shiloh, located in the territory of Ephraim, becomes a central place of worship and governance. This assembly marks a transition from the nomadic life in the wilderness to a more settled existence in the Promised Land. Shiloh's choice as a meeting place is significant, as it becomes the religious center for Israel until the time of Samuel. The gathering at Shiloh also fulfills earlier instructions given in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a> about seeking a place where God would choose to establish His name.<p><b>and set up the Tent of Meeting there.</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites. Setting it up in Shiloh indicates a shift from a temporary to a more permanent location for worship. This act symbolizes God's presence and guidance among His people. The Tabernacle's establishment in Shiloh underscores the importance of worship and obedience to God's commands. It also foreshadows the future establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem, a more permanent dwelling place for God's presence.<p><b>And though the land was subdued before them,</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the military success and divine assistance the Israelites experienced in conquering the Promised Land. The subduing of the land fulfills God's promises to the patriarchs, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>. However, the phrase also implies that while the land was largely under control, there were still areas and peoples that needed to be fully conquered and integrated. This incomplete conquest serves as a reminder of the Israelites' ongoing responsibility to fully obey God's commands and the consequences of failing to do so, as seen in later narratives in the Book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are now in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>A significant location in the tribal territory of Ephraim where the Tent of Meeting was set up, serving as a central place of worship before the temple was built in Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>Also known as the Tabernacle, this was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, symbolizing His presence and guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which was being divided among the tribes of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/subdued.htm">Subdued</a></b><br>Indicates that the land was under control, suggesting a period of peace and stability for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/centrality_of_worship.htm">Centrality of Worship</a></b><br>The setting up of the Tent of Meeting in Shiloh emphasizes the importance of having a central place of worship and the presence of God in the community.

The inheritance of the tribe of Judah was determined in Gilgal. The assignment of the central part of the country to Ephraim and Manasseh brought the leaders of Israel into that district, and as soon as the position of Ephraim, Joshua's tribe, was settled, the tabernacle was set up there. For the situation of Shiloh, see <a href="/judges/21-19.htm" title="Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.">Judges 21:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Congregation</span>. The word signifies a body of persons gathered together at a spot before indicated. The LXX. renders by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>. The idea is evidently that of an assembly gathered together for some specific acts of worship. This passage teaches the duty of a national recognition of religion. Whatever evils there might be in Israel at that time, the absence of a general and formal acknowledgment of God was not one of them. When that public acknowledgment of Him ceased, the downfall of the nation was at hand. It was the absence of such acknowledgment that was the ruin of Israel, while the hypocritical and purely external recognition of God by Judah was equally offensive in God's sight. <span class="cmt_word">Assembled</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">was summoned</span>; by whom, we are not told. But this general gathering to set up the tabernacle was at once an act of due homage to Him by whose power they had done so many great deeds, and also the establishment of a centre of national life. As long as the worship of God was maintained in its purity, the unity of Israel would be preserved, in spite of the twelve-fold division into tribes, and without the need to introduce the monarchical power. When fidelity to the outward symbol of Israelitish unity, the tabernacle at Shiloh, relaxed, then dissension and weakness crept in, and Israel became a prey to her enemies. A remarkable instance of an opposite character meets us in the history of our own country. The prey of various unconnected Teutonic tribes, the island was one vast scene of anarchy and confusion, until the great Archbishop Theodore came over and founded a National Church. It was this religious unity and cooperation which tended to harmonise the conflicting forces in the land and steadily pioneered the way to an union of the rival tribes under one head. Without attempting to say whose fault it is that this religious unity is lost, or how it may best be reestablished, it surely is the duty of every patriot and every Christian to cooperate to the best of his ability and knowledge, with all the forces that he sees tending towards unity, and both pray and labour for the coming of the day when men may once more "with one mind and with one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," and be willing to meet together "with one accord in one place." <span class="cmt_word">Shiloh</span>. In <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14</a>, we find God prescribing that only in a place chosen by Himself shall the public worship of the congregation be paid to Him. Thither were all the males to resort three times a year. It is obvious how such a regulation tended to keep alive national feeling among the Israelites. The reason for the choice of Shiloh (which was probably made by Urim and Thummim, the case being important enough for such a decision) is to be found in its central position, five hours south of Shechem, and eight hours north of Jerusalem. Its situation is minutely described in <a href="/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>. It is difficult to understand why; since Shiloh must have been well known to all the dwellers in Israel at that time, unless it was to explain to those who were not acquainted with the localities in the tribe of Benjamin the reason for the selection of Shiloh, namely, that it lay close by the road between Bethel and Shechem (see, however, note on Joshua 24:1). The place has been identified. It is the modern Seilun, but only a few ruins remain to mark the place once so famous in the history of Israel, where Eli abode, where Samuel spent his early years. Rejected by God Himself, as the Jewish Psalmist relates with patriotic pride (<a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60, 67-69</a>), it fell into utter neglect, and even in the days of Jeremiah it seems to have become a by word (see <a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12, 14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6, 9</a>. Also Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper, Jan., 1873, where an account, with a plan, is given of the place in its present condition. There are a few rock-hewn tombs there). Whether it was named Shiloh on account of the word used in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, it is impossible to say. The name appears to signify <span class="accented">rest</span>, and was an appropriate name to be given to the visible symbol of rest from warfare which Joshua had obtained for Israel (see <a href="/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-4.htm">Joshua 22:4</a>). The difficult passage in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> is not of course included in this interpretation of the meaning of the word Shiloh. <span class="cmt_word">Congregation</span> The word here differs slightly from the word translated "congregation" in the first part of the verse, but it comes from the same root. <span class="cmt_word">And the land was subdued before them.</span> That is, the land in which the tabernacle was set up.
