Hazor was a significant Canaanite city, often considered the head of all those kingdoms (<a href="/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). The act of putting everyone to the sword reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of total warfare, where the complete annihilation of the enemy was sometimes seen as necessary to prevent future threats. This action was also in obedience to God's command to the Israelites to completely destroy the Canaanite nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>), which was intended to prevent the Israelites from being led astray by pagan practices.<p><b>devoting them to destruction</b><br>The term "devoting to destruction" translates the Hebrew word "herem," which means to consecrate something to God by completely destroying it. This was a form of divine judgment against the Canaanites for their idolatry and wickedness (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>). It also served to purify the land for the Israelites, ensuring that no pagan influences would remain to corrupt them. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in the destruction of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-21</a>).<p><b>Nothing that breathed remained</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of the destruction. It underscores the completeness of the judgment executed upon Hazor, leaving no survivors. This mirrors the instructions given in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>, where God commanded the Israelites to leave nothing alive in the cities of the nations He was giving them as an inheritance. The thoroughness of this destruction was intended to prevent any future resurgence of the Canaanite culture and religion.<p><b>and Joshua burned down Hazor itself</b><br>Burning the city was a symbolic act of finality, ensuring that Hazor could not be easily rebuilt or reoccupied. Archaeological evidence supports the biblical account, as excavations at Hazor have revealed a layer of destruction by fire dating to the time of Joshua. This act of burning also served as a visible sign of God's judgment and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel. The destruction of Hazor can be seen as a type of the ultimate judgment that will come upon the world, as described in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon the Great is also burned and destroyed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, who led the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazor.htm">Hazor</a></b><br>A significant Canaanite city, described as the head of all those kingdoms, which was targeted and destroyed by the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land of Canaan, who were the primary opponents of the Israelites during their conquest of the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were fulfilling God's promise to give them the land of Canaan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_conquest_of_canaan.htm">The Conquest of Canaan</a></b><br>A series of military campaigns led by Joshua to take possession of the land promised by God to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Joshua's actions demonstrate the importance of following God's instructions completely, even when they are difficult or challenging.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_severity_of_sin.htm">The Severity of Sin</a></b><br>The complete destruction of Hazor serves as a reminder of the seriousness with which God views sin and idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>The conquest of Canaan illustrates God's sovereign plan and His justice in dealing with nations that oppose His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were called to destroy physical strongholds, Christians are called to demolish spiritual strongholds in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>The fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites the land of Canaan encourages believers to trust in God's promises for their lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_11_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 11:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_11_11_God_s_judgment_on_sin.htm">How does Joshua 11:11 demonstrate God's judgment against persistent sinfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_obedience_from_Joshua_11_11.htm">What can we learn about obedience from Joshua's actions in Joshua 11:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Joshua_11_11_to_Deut_7_2_promises.htm">How does Joshua 11:11 connect to God's promises in Deuteronomy 7:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_God_s_commands.htm">How should believers today respond to God's commands, as seen in Joshua 11:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_11_11_Consequences_of_defiance.htm">What does Joshua 11:11 teach about the consequences of opposing God's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_11_11_and_God_s_love_align.htm">How does Joshua 11:11 align with the concept of a loving and merciful God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Joshua_11_11_events.htm">What archaeological evidence supports the events described in Joshua 11:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_were_all_killed_in_Joshua_11_11.htm">Why were no survivors left according to Joshua 11:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_there_proof_of_psalm_111_6's_events.htm">Psalm 111:6 speaks of God gifting nations to His people&#8212;what archaeological proof exists that this specific divine intervention took place?

He resolved to prevent this in the case of Hazor, which had been the capital of the neighbourhood, though he did not think the same step necessary in the case of the inferior cities. Hazor was afterwards rebuilt and reoccupied by the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>), though not in the time of Joshua. For the present, this destruction of the stronghold of Phoenician power in the north was a decisive measure, and would have been so permanently had the Israelites followed up the policy of Joshua. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[The Israelites] struck down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1440;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yak&#183;k&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
