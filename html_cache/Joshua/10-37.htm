The act of capturing and putting to the sword signifies total military victory and the execution of judgment upon the city. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such actions were common in warfare, especially when a city was considered under divine judgment. The king's execution symbolizes the removal of leadership and authority, ensuring no future rebellion. The mention of "all its villages" indicates the thoroughness of the conquest, extending beyond the main city to its surrounding settlements. This reflects the fulfillment of God's command to the Israelites to take possession of the Promised Land and eliminate the Canaanite influence, which was seen as corrupt and idolatrous.<p><b>Joshua left no survivors, just as he had done at Eglon;</b><br>The phrase "left no survivors" emphasizes the completeness of the destruction, aligning with the concept of herem, or the ban, where certain cities were devoted to destruction as an offering to God. This was not merely an act of war but a religious act of obedience to God's command. The reference to Eglon serves as a precedent, showing a pattern in Joshua's conquests. It highlights the consistency in Joshua's leadership and the Israelites' commitment to God's instructions. This also serves as a warning to other Canaanite cities about the seriousness of God's judgment.<p><b>he devoted to destruction Hebron and everyone in it.</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" is significant, indicating that Hebron was set apart for complete annihilation as an act of divine judgment. This was not just a military strategy but a theological statement about the holiness of God and the need to purify the land from idolatry and sin. Hebron, being a significant city with historical ties to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, underscores the gravity of its destruction. The complete destruction of everyone in it reflects the severity of God's judgment against sin and the fulfillment of His promises to give the land to the descendants of Abraham. This act prefigures the ultimate judgment and purification that will be accomplished through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the role of both judge and savior.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the conquest of Canaan.
