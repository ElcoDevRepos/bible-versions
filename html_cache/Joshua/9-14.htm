The act of sampling their provisions indicates a reliance on their own judgment and senses. This reflects a common human tendency to trust in physical evidence rather than seeking divine guidance. The provisions, which appeared old and worn, were part of the Gibeonites' ruse to secure a treaty. This moment highlights the importance of discernment and the potential for deception when relying solely on human perception.<p><b>but did not seek the counsel of the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores a critical error made by the Israelites. Throughout the Old Testament, seeking God's counsel was a fundamental practice for Israel, especially in decision-making. The failure to consult God here contrasts with previous instances where divine guidance led to success, such as the crossing of the Jordan River and the fall of Jericho. This oversight serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of neglecting prayer and divine consultation. It also foreshadows the consequences of their decision, as the Israelites later discovered the true identity of the Gibeonites, leading to complications and obligations they had not anticipated. This incident emphasizes the necessity of seeking God's wisdom in all matters, a principle echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises trust in the Lord over one's own understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are in the process of conquering the land of Canaan as God commanded.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gibeonites.htm">The Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people from Canaan who deceived the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them by pretending to be from a distant land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>A significant city in Canaan, whose inhabitants sought to make a treaty with Israel to avoid destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_god's_counsel.htm">The Importance of Seeking God's Counsel</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure to seek God's guidance led to unintended consequences.

Consistent prayer shields us from costly shortcuts.<p>&#8226; The episode underscores Scripture&#8217;s accuracy in portraying human frailty and the literal consequences of disobedience: the Gibeonites lived among Israel as wood-cutters and water-carriers, fulfilling Joshua&#8217;s oath yet becoming a perpetual reminder of this lapse (<a href="/joshua/9-26.htm">Joshua 9:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a> teaches that victories and careful analysis are not enough; God expects His people to ask Him first.

The verse calls every believer to place divine guidance above human perception, trusting the Lord who sees beyond appearances and directs paths for those who seek His counsel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And the men took of their victuals.</span>--<span class= "ital">And they accepted the men from </span>(the appearance of) <span class= "ital">their provisions. </span>This, which is the view taken in our marginal reading, seems to be the more probable interpretation, and follows the Targum. "The men" can hardly refer to any one but the ambassadors of the Gibeonites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the men took of their victuals.</span> Most commentators prefer this rendering to that of the margin, "and they received the men because of their victuals." The natural explanation - though several others are given, for which see Keil <span class="accented">in loc. -</span> would seem to be that the Israelites relied on the evidence of their senses, instead of upon the counsel of God. They could see the condition of the garments, sacks, and wine skins of the Gibeonites. They tasted of their victuals to convince themselves of the truth of those statements of which the sight was insufficient to take cognisance. <span class="cmt_word">And asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord.</span> Even in the most obvious matter it is well not to trust too implicitly to our own judgment. Nothing could seem more clear or satisfactory than the account given of themselves by the Gibeonites - nothing more easy for the unassisted intellect to decide. And yet Joshua and the congregation were deceived. It is perhaps too much to say, with some commentators - Maurer, for instance - that Joshua disobeyed a plain command in acting thus. The passage in which Joshua is instructed to "stand up before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him at the judgment of Urim before the Lord" (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>), does not require him to do so in all cases. But it was clearly "an act of gross carelessness" (Calvin). And the inference may safely be drawn that in no case whatever is it wise to trust to ourselves. However obvious our course may be, we shall do well to take counsel with God by prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/9-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the men of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_582.htm">Strong's 582: </a> </span><span class="str2">Man, mankind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sampled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their provisions,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6718.htm">Strong's 6718: </a> </span><span class="str2">The chase, game, lunch</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">seek</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7592.htm">Strong's 7592: </a> </span><span class="str2">To inquire, to request, to demand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the counsel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">OT History: Joshua 9:14 The men sampled their provisions and didn't (Josh.
