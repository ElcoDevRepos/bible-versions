This obedience is reminiscent of earlier commands given to Moses and the Israelites, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>, where God instructs them to completely destroy the nations in the Promised Land. Joshua's actions here are a continuation of the covenantal faithfulness expected of Israel's leaders. This obedience is also a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<p><b>he hamstrung their horses</b><br>Hamstringing horses involved cutting the tendons of the hind legs, rendering them useless for battle. This act was significant because it demonstrated reliance on God rather than military might, as horses and chariots were symbols of power and strength in ancient warfare (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). By disabling the horses, Joshua ensured that Israel would not be tempted to trust in these war instruments, aligning with God's command in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, which warned against amassing horses.<p><b>and burned up their chariots.</b><br>Burning the chariots further symbolizes the rejection of reliance on human strength and technology. Chariots were advanced military technology of the time, and their destruction signified a commitment to trust in God's provision and protection. This act also fulfilled God's instructions and served as a physical manifestation of divine judgment against the Canaanite nations. The destruction of chariots can be seen as a precursor to the ultimate victory over sin and death through Christ, who triumphed not by earthly power but through sacrifice and resurrection (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the leader of the Israelites following Moses.
