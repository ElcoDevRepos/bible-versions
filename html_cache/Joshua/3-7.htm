It parallels the way God spoke to Moses, establishing Joshua as Moses' rightful successor. This communication underscores the continuity of God's plan and leadership for Israel.<p><b>Today I will begin to exalt you</b><br>God's promise to exalt Joshua marks a pivotal moment in his leadership. This exaltation is not for Joshua's personal glory but to affirm his role as leader. It reflects God's pattern of raising leaders at the right time, as seen with figures like Joseph and David. The timing ("Today") signifies the immediacy and importance of the events about to unfold.<p><b>in the sight of all Israel</b><br>The public nature of Joshua's exaltation is crucial for establishing his authority among the Israelites. It ensures that the people recognize and respect his leadership, which is essential for the unity and success of the nation. This public affirmation is reminiscent of Moses' leadership being confirmed through signs and wonders.<p><b>so they may know that I am with you</b><br>This assurance of God's presence is central to Joshua's mission. It echoes God's promise to Moses and reassures the Israelites that their journey is under divine guidance. The phrase highlights the importance of God's presence for success and victory, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>just as I was with Moses</b><br>By comparing Joshua to Moses, God reinforces the continuity of His covenant and leadership. This comparison not only legitimizes Joshua's leadership but also comforts the Israelites, reminding them of God's past faithfulness.
