Bashan was known for its fertile land and strong cities, such as Ashtaroth and Edrei. This allocation fulfilled part of the promise to the descendants of Joseph, as Manasseh was one of his sons. The division of land east of the Jordan was significant because it demonstrated God's faithfulness in providing for all tribes, even those not settling in Canaan proper. This allocation also highlights the leadership of Moses in establishing the tribes before his death.<p><b>and to the other half Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan among their brothers</b><br>Joshua, as Moses' successor, continued the distribution of the Promised Land. The other half of the tribe of Manasseh received their inheritance west of the Jordan, integrating them with the other tribes in Canaan. This division ensured that the tribe of Manasseh had a presence on both sides of the Jordan, symbolizing unity and cooperation among the tribes. It also reflects the broader theme of God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises to the patriarchs, as seen in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where Jacob prophesied that Manasseh would become a great people.<p><b>When Joshua sent them to their homes he blessed them</b><br>Joshua's blessing upon sending the tribes to their homes signifies a formal and spiritual acknowledgment of their service and faithfulness. The act of blessing is a recurring biblical theme, often associated with imparting God's favor and protection. Joshua's leadership is marked by his adherence to God's commands and his role as a spiritual leader, similar to Moses. This blessing also serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing obedience and faithfulness as keys to receiving God's continued blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Half-Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>This tribe was unique in that it was divided, with one half receiving land in Bashan (east of the Jordan) and the other half receiving land west of the Jordan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader who initially allocated land to the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, demonstrating his role in the early distribution of the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The successor of Moses who continued the distribution of land, giving the other half of the tribe of Manasseh their inheritance west of the Jordan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>A fertile region east of the Jordan River, known for its rich pastures and strong cities, given to the half-tribe of Manasseh by Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jordan_river.htm">Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical boundary in Israel's history, symbolizing the division between the lands east and west of the river.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The division of the tribe of Manasseh across the Jordan River illustrates how God's people can be united in purpose despite geographical and tribal differences.

The verse reminds us that every boundary, every inheritance, and every blessing comes from the LORD who never fails to keep His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7, 8) Joshua blesses the half tribe of Manasseh that dwelt on the west of Jordan.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">When Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them.</span>--It is noteworthy that of all the tribes of Israel who followed Joshua, and remained with him, this half tribe alone is mentioned as receiving a special blessing. We cannot fail to observe that both in ancient times, and also among ourselves, the conduct of the two and a half tribes in choosing their inheritance on the east of Jordan has been regarded as laying them open to some blame. Historically, this is incorrect. God delivered the land of Sihon and Og to Israel; some one must inherit it. Again, the true eastern boundary of Palestine is not the Jordan, but the mountain range of Gilead, which parts it from the desert that lies beyond. Really the two and a half tribes were as much in Palestine as the rest, only their position does not take advantage of that wonderful miracle by which Jordan was driven back, and the Israelites were enabled to strike at the heart of their Canaanitish foes. They themselves, however, were compelled to cross the Jordan before they could obtain the <span class= "ital">nest </span>which they seemed to have won before they crossed it--"that they without us should not be made perfect." In the spiritual world these two and a half tribes answer to the people who received their inheritance from Moses (i.e., from the law); the others are those who received nothing until they followed Joshua, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Captain of salvation, Jesus Christ, who gives rest to <span class= "ital">all. </span>When He came, His own people were divided, like the tribe of Manasseh. Some could not forsake Moses, a sacrifice which they thought He required of them; some gave up all, and followed Him. "Forgetting (Heb., <span class= "ital">M</span>'<span class= "ital">nasheh</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Manasseh) the things that were behind, and reaching forth unto the things before," they would take nothing but what He gave. These are they who receive special blessing from Him. (See <span class= "ital">Names on the Gates of Pearl</span>--Manasseh, p. 165, &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh.</span> We have here, as Keil remarks, a specimen of our author's habit of repetition. Four times do we read (<a href="/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14, 33</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-3.htm">Joshua 14:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-7.htm">Joshua 18:7</a>) that the Levites were to have no share in the division of the land. Four times (in <a href="/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-3.htm">Joshua 14:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-7.htm">Joshua 18:7</a>, and here) does he repeat that the tribe of Manasseh was divided into two, and had its inheritance on either side Jordan. The same kind of repetition occurs in the narrative of the passing of the Jordan. It has been before remarked to be a characteristic of the style of the Old Testament generally, but nowhere is it found to a greater degree than in the Book of Joshua. Yet this, to which critics of the analytical school have objected as a sign of spuriousness, is in fact one of those peculiarities of style which mark the individuality of the writer. It is to inspired history what the Gospel and Epistles of St. John are to inspired theology. The form belongs to the author; the matter, at least as regards its general purport, belongs to God. A Hebrew writer, we are reminded in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' does not quote or refer to what has been already stated. If it is necessary to make his narrative clear, he repeats it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/22-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">(To the half-tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1510;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;
