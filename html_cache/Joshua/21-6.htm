As descendants of Levi, the Gershonites were set apart for specific duties related to the tabernacle, primarily involving the care of the tabernacle's fabrics and coverings (<a href="/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25-26</a>). This division highlights the organized structure of Israelite worship and the importance of the Levites in maintaining the sacred space.<p><b>received thirteen cities by lot</b><br>The allocation of cities by lot underscores the belief in divine providence guiding the distribution of land. The number thirteen is significant, as it reflects the specific needs and size of the Gershonite clan.

The half-tribe of Manasseh settled in this area, which was part of the land conquered from Og, king of Bashan (<a href="/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33-35</a>).
