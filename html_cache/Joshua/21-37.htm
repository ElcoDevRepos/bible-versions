It is mentioned in the context of the Levitical cities given to the Merarite clan. The name Kedemoth means "eastern parts," which may indicate its geographical position. In <a href="/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26</a>, Moses sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, seeking passage through his land. This highlights its strategic location and its role in Israel's journey to the Promised Land. The city served as a reminder of God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises to the tribes of Israel.<p><b>and Mephaath</b><br>Mephaath was another city given to the tribe of Reuben and assigned to the Levites. It is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a> as part of the Moabite territory, indicating its proximity to Moab. The name Mephaath means "splendor" or "beauty," suggesting a place of significance or attractiveness. The allocation of Mephaath to the Levites underscores the importance of providing for those who served in the temple, ensuring they had resources to sustain their ministry. This reflects the broader biblical principle of supporting those dedicated to spiritual service.<p><b>four cities</b><br>The mention of "four cities" refers to the total number of cities given to the Merarite Levites from the tribe of Reuben. This allocation was part of the larger distribution of Levitical cities throughout Israel, as commanded by God. The Levites were not given a specific territory like the other tribes but were instead dispersed among the tribes to perform their priestly duties and teach the Law. This distribution ensured that the spiritual needs of the entire nation were met and that the Levites could serve as a unifying spiritual influence.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The inclusion of "pasturelands" highlights the practical needs of the Levites, who required land to support their livestock and sustain their families. This provision reflects God's care for the Levites' material needs, allowing them to focus on their spiritual responsibilities. The pasturelands also symbolize the idea of rest and provision, themes that are echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd providing for His flock. This allocation ensured that the Levites could maintain their livelihood while fulfilling their sacred duties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kedemoth.htm">Kedemoth</a></b><br>A city allocated to the tribe of Reuben, located in the territory east of the Jordan River.

Its earlier mention in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26</a> places it in the wilderness east of the Jordan, from which Moses sent messengers to Sihon. By connecting these passages, we see Kedemoth had long been familiar to Israel before becoming a Levitical city. The inclusion of Kedemoth fulfills the divine instruction of <a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a> that designated towns be set apart for Levites so they could minister while living among the other tribes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mephaath</b><p>&#8226; Alongside Kedemoth, Mephaath is listed in <a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a> among Reuben&#8217;s inheritance, and later in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79</a> as a Kohathite city. <a href="/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a> cites Mephaath during an oracle against Moab, indicating the town lay near Moab&#8217;s border. The Levites stationed there acted as a godly influence in a region prone to idolatry, demonstrating how God strategically places His servants (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-5.htm">Deuteronomy 18:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Four cities</b><p>&#8226; Verses 36-37 summarize the allotment from Reuben: &#8220;Bezer&#8230; Jahaz&#8230; Kedemoth&#8230; and Mephaath &#8212; four cities&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-36.htm">Joshua 21:36-37</a>). The specific number matters; it shows the precision with which God kept His promise to provide forty-eight Levitical cities in total (<a href="/joshua/21-41.htm">Joshua 21:41</a>). Every tribe contributed, underscoring national responsibility to support worship and teaching (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Together with their pasturelands</b><p>&#8226; Each city came &#8220;with its pasturelands,&#8221; exactly as commanded in <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-3</a>. These open lands supplied food for the Levites&#8217; livestock, freeing them to focus on temple duties, teaching, and adjudication (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8-9</a>). The provision highlights God&#8217;s care for those devoted to spiritual service and invites His people to generous support (<a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37</a> shows God faithfully allocating Kedemoth and Mephaath, two of the four Kohathite cities taken from Reuben, complete with surrounding pasturelands. The verse illustrates the Lord&#8217;s detailed provision for His servants, the nation&#8217;s shared duty to sustain worship, and His strategic placement of spiritual leaders where their witness was most needed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/21-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Kedemoth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6932.htm">Strong's 6932: </a> </span><span class="str2">Kedemoth -- a city in Reuben</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Mephaath&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1508;&#1464;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4158.htm">Strong's 4158: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mephaath -- a Levitical city in Reuben</span><br /><br /><span class="word">four</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_702.htm">Strong's 702: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cities,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">along with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Direct object marker<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their pasturelands.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7713;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#353;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4054.htm">Strong's 4054: </a> </span><span class="str2">A suburb, the area around a, building, the margin of the sea</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/21-37.htm">OT History: Joshua 21:37 Kedemoth with its suburbs and Mephaath (Josh.
