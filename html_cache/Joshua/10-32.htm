Lachish was a significant Canaanite city, strategically located in the Shephelah region. The phrase underscores the belief that it was not by Israel's might but by God's will that the city was conquered. This reflects the recurring biblical theme of God fighting for Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>. Archaeological evidence suggests Lachish was a fortified city, making its capture a notable event.<p><b>and Joshua captured it on the second day</b><br>The mention of the "second day" indicates a relatively swift victory, suggesting both the effectiveness of Joshua's leadership and the demoralization of the Canaanite forces. This rapid conquest contrasts with the prolonged sieges typical of ancient warfare, further highlighting divine assistance. The quick capture also demonstrates the momentum Israel had gained in their campaign, as seen in the broader narrative of Joshua's conquests.<p><b>He put all the people to the sword</b><br>This phrase reflects the practice of herem, or the devotion of a city to destruction, which was commanded by God in certain instances (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>). It signifies the complete eradication of the city's inhabitants, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern warfare intended to prevent future rebellion and idolatry. This action is often difficult for modern readers but was understood within its historical and cultural context as a means of preserving the religious purity of Israel.<p><b>just as he had done to Libnah</b><br>Libnah was another Canaanite city that had been previously conquered by Joshua. The comparison to Libnah serves to illustrate the consistency and thoroughness of Joshua's campaign. It also reinforces the idea that the victories were part of a divinely ordained plan, as each city fell in a similar manner. This phrase connects the events at Lachish to the broader narrative of conquest, showing a pattern of divine judgment and fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, who led the Israelites in the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lachish.htm">Lachish</a></b><br>A significant Canaanite city-state in the Shephelah region of Israel, known for its strategic importance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is actively involved in the battles and victories of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/libnah.htm">Libnah</a></b><br>Another Canaanite city that was previously conquered by Joshua, setting a precedent for the conquest of Lachish.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, chosen to inherit the Promised Land and tasked with driving out the inhabitants of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty_in_victory.htm">Divine Sovereignty in Victory</a></b><br>Recognize that it is the LORD who grants victory.

Israel&#8217;s victory is not military genius but divine intervention, echoing earlier assurances: &#8220;Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant promises is on full display (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>). Lachish, a well&#8211;fortified Canaanite city, falls because &#8220;it was not by their sword that they took the land&#8230; it was Your right hand&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminds us that every battle narrated in Joshua is theological before it is historical. The conquest fulfills the pledge first given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Joshua captured it on the second day</b><p>&#8226; The quick, two-day siege underscores both Israel&#8217;s momentum and the effectiveness of trusting God&#8217;s strategy. Unlike Jericho&#8217;s seven-day march (<a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>), Lachish yields rapidly, illustrating that God tailors His methods while guaranteeing the same outcome&#8212;victory.<p>&#8226; Perseverance still matters: they fought through &#8220;the second day,&#8221; not giving in to fatigue. The pattern mirrors the second assault on Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-9.htm">Joshua 8:9-25</a>), teaching that persistence aligned with God&#8217;s word brings results (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the exact day, Scripture grounds the event in real time, reinforcing its historical reliability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He put all the people to the sword</b><p>&#8226; This difficult line reflects the command of &#8220;herem,&#8221; total destruction, already stated in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>. Israel acts as God&#8217;s agent of judgment against entrenched, generational wickedness (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The severity highlights the holiness of God and the seriousness of sin. Similar language is used at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>) and later at Hazor (<a href="/joshua/11-11.htm">Joshua 11:11</a>).<p>&#8226; While modern readers wrestle with the violence, the text insists on the moral dimension: &#8220;the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). God alone has the right to give life and to take it, and here He exercises that right through Israel as a judicial act (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as he had done to Libnah</b><p>&#8226; The comparison to Libnah (<a href="/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29-30</a>) shows a consistent pattern of obedience. Joshua does not deviate from God&#8217;s instructions; partial obedience would equal disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Each victory builds faith for the next. Observing God&#8217;s past faithfulness fuels courage for new challenges (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The repetition also assures Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that God&#8217;s standards don&#8217;t shift. What He required at Libnah He still requires at Lachish, highlighting His unchanging character (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/10-32.htm">Joshua 10:32</a> depicts another decisive step in Israel&#8217;s southern campaign. God grants the victory, Joshua swiftly carries it out, complete judgment falls on persistent evil, and the pattern of faithful obedience continues unbroken. The verse calls readers to trust God&#8217;s promises, persevere in obedience, take sin seriously, and remember that the LORD who delivered Lachish is still able to deliver today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">On the second day.</span>--With this fact we may connect two other facts of later history. When Sennacherib, king of Assyria, "came up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took them" (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2Kings 18:13</a>), although he "laid siege to Lachish, and all his power with him" (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-9.htm" title="After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,">2Chronicles 32:9</a>), he had to abandon the siege (<a href="/2_kings/19-8.htm" title="So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.">2Kings 19:8</a>). Again, when Nebuchadnezzar invaded the kingdom of Judah in the reign of Zedekiah, the last king, we read ( <a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm" title="When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defended cities remained of the cities of Judah.">Jeremiah 34:7</a>) of his army fighting "against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah, for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah." All these notices of Lachish point to its being a fortress of considerable strength. And the undesigned and indirect agreement of these three passages, which lie so far asunder, is worthy of observation.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">delivered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
