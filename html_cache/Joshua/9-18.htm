The Israelites refrained from attacking due to the covenant they had made. This highlights the importance of oaths and covenants in ancient Near Eastern culture, where breaking an oath was seen as a serious offense. The Israelites' decision not to attack, despite the deception, underscores the binding nature of their agreement.<p><b>because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them</b><br>The leaders' oath was a solemn promise, reflecting the weight of spoken words in biblical times. Swearing an oath was a sacred act, often invoking divine witness. This reflects the biblical principle that one's word should be trustworthy and binding, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which emphasize the importance of fulfilling vows.<p><b>by the LORD, the God of Israel</b><br>Invoking the name of the LORD in an oath added a divine dimension, making it irrevocable. This reflects the understanding of God as a witness and enforcer of covenants. The use of God's name in the oath indicates the seriousness with which the Israelites viewed their commitment, aligning with the commandment against taking the Lord's name in vain (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>).<p><b>And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders</b><br>The congregation's grumbling reflects a common biblical theme of dissent and dissatisfaction among the people, reminiscent of the Israelites' complaints during their wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). This reaction highlights the tension between the leaders' decision and the people's expectations, illustrating the challenges of leadership and the consequences of decisions made without seeking divine guidance, as the leaders failed to consult God before making the treaty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Joshua, who are in the process of conquering the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gibeonites.htm">The Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people from the region of Canaan who deceived the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_leaders_of_the_assembly.htm">The Leaders of the Assembly</a></b><br>The elders and leaders of Israel who made the oath with the Gibeonites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord,_the_god_of_israel.htm">The LORD, the God of Israel</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose name was invoked in the oath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_assembly.htm">The Whole Assembly</a></b><br>The congregation of Israel who were upset with their leaders for making the treaty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discernment.htm">The Importance of Discernment</a></b><br>The Israelites failed to seek God's guidance before making the treaty.

When the Gibeonites resort to deception and secure a treaty (<a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3-15</a>), Israel discovers the ruse &#8220;on the third day&#8221; yet withholds the sword.<p>- Their restraint underscores that obedience is not merely about conquering territory; it is about honoring God&#8217;s directives in every circumstance. Compare the similar moment in <a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a> where David refuses to &#8220;stretch out my hand against him, since he is the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221;.<p>- <a href="/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6-10</a> shows God still fights for Israel later, proving that choosing integrity never forfeits divine help.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel</b><p>- An oath invokes the Name above all names. <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> reminds us, &#8220;When a man makes a vow to the LORD&#8230;he must not break his word&#8221;.<p>- Breaking this covenant would have meant profaning God&#8217;s reputation among the nations (<a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>).

Israel now learns that faithfulness may feel costly, yet it mirrors God&#8217;s own unwavering covenant love (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>- Jesus re-emphasizes the heart behind oaths in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, calling His people to such transparent truthfulness that elaborate vows become unnecessary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders</b><p>- The tension between duty to God and pressure from people is familiar: &#8220;All the congregation grumbled against Moses and Aaron&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>).

Israel&#8217;s leaders, though deceived, refuse to violate an oath made in God&#8217;s Name. Their example teaches that honoring the Lord requires integrity even when it provokes criticism. Scripture consistently affirms that God blesses those who keep their word, value His reputation above personal ease, and lead with courage amid grumbling voices.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel smote them not.</span> There is great difference of opinion among the commentators as to whether this oath were binding off the Israelites or not. This difference is to be found among Roman Catholics as well as Protestants, and Cornelius a Lapide gives the ingenious and subtle arguments used on both sides by the Jesuit commentators. Many contend that as it was obtained by fraud, and especially by a representation that the Gibeonites did not belong to the tribes which Joshua was specially commanded to destroy (see <a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10-18</a>, with which compare the passages cited in note on ver. 7), it was null and void, <span class="accented">ab initio.</span> But the Israelites had sworn by the sacred name of Jehovah to spare the Gibeonites. It would have been to degrade that sacred name, and possibly (ver. 20) to bring trouble on themselves, to break that oath under any pretence whatever. If they had been deceived the fault was their own. The Jehovah by whom they swore had provided them with a ready mode of detecting such deceit, had they chosen to use it. Calvin, though he thinks the princes of the congregation were unnecessarily scrupulous, remarks on the superiority of Israelitish to Roman morals. It would have been easy enough for the congregation to argue, as the Romans did after the disaster at the Candine Forks, that the agreement was of no effect, because it was not made with the whole people. Cicero, however, had no sympathy with such morality. He writes ('De Officiis,' 1:13), "Atque etiam si quid singuli temporibus adducti, hosti promiserunt, est in eo ipso tides conservanda." And not a few instances of similar perfidy since the promulgation of Christianity may lead us to the conclusion that the example of Israel trader Joshua is not yet superfluous. As instances of such perfidy, we may adduce the battle of Varna, in 1444, in which Ladislaus, king of Hungary, was induced by the exhortations of Cardinal Julian to break the truce he bad entered into with Amurath, sultan of the Turks. It is said in this case that Amurath, in his distress, invoked Jesus Christ to punish the perfidy of His disciples. Be that as it may, a signal defeat fitly rewarded their disregard of truth. Later instances may be drawn from the conflict between Spain and the Netherlands in the latter part of the sixteenth century, in which the Spaniards frequently and wantonly, in the supposed interests of religion, violated the articles of capitulation formally entered into with the insurgents. These breakers of their plighted word also found that "wrath was upon them;" that God would not prosper the arms of those who, professedly for His sake, were false to their solemn obligations. Both the princes, in the narrative before us, in withstanding the wrath of the congregation, and the congregation in yielding to their representations, present a spectacle of moral principle which few nations have surpassed. Cornelius a Lapide, after giving the opinions of others, as we have seen, and remarking on the opinion here followed as "probabilior," sums up in the following noble and manly words: "Disce hic quam sancte fides, praesertim jurata, sit servanda hosti, etiam impio et infideli. Fide enim sublata, evertitur omnis hominum contractus et societas, quae fidei quasi basi innititur, ut homines jam non homines, sed leones, tygrides, et ferae esse videantur." Would that his Church had always acted upon these insatiable principles of justice and morality! In after years a terrible famine visited the Israelites as a chastisement for the infringement of this agreement (see <a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Murmured</span>.
