Joshua, as a type of Christ, leads his people into battle, symbolizing spiritual warfare and the need for unity in faith. The phrase also highlights the importance of leadership and obedience in achieving God's purposes, as seen throughout the conquest narratives.<p><b>moved on from Makkedah</b><br>Makkedah was a Canaanite city that had just been conquered by Joshua and the Israelites. This movement signifies the ongoing campaign to claim the Promised Land, reflecting God's promise to Abraham about his descendants inheriting the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The transition from one victory to another illustrates the progressive nature of God's plan for His people.<p><b>to Libnah</b><br>Libnah was a city in the Shephelah region of Judah. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a fortified city, typical of the Canaanite settlements. The conquest of Libnah is part of the southern campaign, demonstrating the systematic approach Joshua took in securing the land. Libnah later becomes a Levitical city (<a href="/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13</a>), indicating its significance in Israel's religious and cultural life.<p><b>and fought against Libnah</b><br>This phrase underscores the continuous nature of the battles faced by the Israelites. The fight against Libnah is part of the broader narrative of the conquest of Canaan, which involves both divine intervention and human responsibility. The battles serve as a reminder of the spiritual battles believers face, requiring faith and reliance on God's promises. The conquest of Libnah, like other cities, fulfills the command given in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a> to destroy the Canaanite nations, symbolizing the eradication of sin and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.

See note on ch. 9:1; also <a href="/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42</a>. It became a Levitical city. It revolted from Judah in the reign of Joram (<a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>). It seems to have returned to its allegiance, since we find it not included in the conquest of Israel by Shalmaneser, while, on the other hand, it undergoes a siege among the fenced cities of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>). The cause (see Blunt 'Undesigned Coincidences,' part 2:27) of this return is not far to seek. The Levites cast off the authority of Joram "because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers" (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-10.htm">2 Chronicles 21:10, 11</a>). It probably remained independent - for it was not likely to have joined itself to Israel, either from geographical position or religious principles - until the accession of Joash terminated the connection between the royal house of Judah and the descendants of the wicked Ahab. Libnah, or the white city, has been identified with Tell es Safieh, the <span class="accented">Blanche Garde</span> of the Crusaders. See Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 207, 258. Lieut. Conder, however, supposes it to have been Eleutheropolis, now Beit Jibrin, and Capt. Warren believes he has found it at Ibna. Vanclevelde suggests yet another site. But Lieut. Conder's description of the hill on which Tell es Safieh stands as "a white precipice of many hundred feet" ('Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper,' July, 1875), would account for the name Libnah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1440;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
