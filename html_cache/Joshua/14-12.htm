The "hill country" refers to the region of Hebron, a significant area in biblical history. Hebron is located in the southern part of the land of Canaan and is known for its rugged terrain. It is also the burial place of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, making it a spiritually significant location.<p><b>that the LORD promised me on that day</b><br>Caleb refers to the promise made by God through Moses that he would inherit the land he had explored because of his faithfulness (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>). This promise underscores the theme of divine faithfulness and reward for obedience. Caleb's request is based on a specific divine promise, highlighting the importance of God's word and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>for you yourself heard then that the Anakim were there</b><br>The Anakim were a race of giants mentioned in the Bible, known for their formidable size and strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-2.htm">Deuteronomy 9:2</a>). Their presence in the land was a source of fear for the other spies, but Caleb's faith in God's promise allowed him to see beyond the physical challenges. This reference emphasizes the contrast between fear and faith, and the importance of trusting in God's power over human obstacles.<p><b>with great and fortified cities</b><br>The mention of "great and fortified cities" indicates the significant military challenge that the inhabitants of Canaan posed. These cities were well-defended and strategically important, representing the strength and resilience of the Canaanite people. Caleb's willingness to confront these challenges demonstrates his courage and reliance on God's strength rather than human might.<p><b>Perhaps with the LORD&#8217;s help I will drive them out</b><br>Caleb acknowledges his dependence on God for victory, recognizing that success is not guaranteed by human effort alone but requires divine intervention. This statement reflects a humble reliance on God's power and a recognition of human limitations. It also illustrates the biblical principle that faith requires action, but ultimate success is granted by God.<p><b>as the LORD has spoken</b><br>Caleb's confidence is rooted in the word of God, as he recalls the divine promise of victory over the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-36.htm">Deuteronomy 1:36</a>). This phrase underscores the authority and reliability of God's word, serving as a reminder that God's promises are sure and trustworthy.

In this way the hill country of challenge becomes the ground of fulfilled inheritance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This mountain.</span> The neighbourhood of Hebron is described by Bartlett 'Egypt to Palestine,' p. 401, as "a region of hills and valleys." In one of the hollows in this "hill country of Judaea" Hebron still nestles, but at a height which (see Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 102) is "only 400 feet lower than Helvellyn," the highest point but one in England. The Dean remarks on the fact that Palestine was a mountainous country, and that therefore in its history we may expect the characteristics of a mountain people. <span class="cmt_word">Whereof the Lord spake in that day.</span> There must therefore have been a promise made to Caleb, regarding which the Pentateuch, having to deal with matters of more general interest, is silent, that he should lead the forlorn hope, as it were, of the children of Israel, and that the task of subduing the mountain fastnesses of the most powerful tribes in Palestine should be assigned to him. That the original inhabitants reoccupied the districts round Hebron, while the Israelites were otherwise engaged, we have already seen (see note on Joshua 11:21). The final work was to be carried out by Caleb. Houbigant, it is true, thinks that here the same incident is referred to as in <a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21, 22</a>, and that Joshua is there credited with what was clone by Caleb at his command. But we read that that expedition followed close upon the battle of Merom, whereas seven years elapsed before the final expulsion of the Anakim by Caleb. It is important to notice that the author of the Book of Joshua has access to sources of information beside the Pentateuch. This, though not sufficient to disprove, does at least seem inconsistent with the "Elohist" and "Jehovist" theory. <span class="cmt_word">For thou heartiest in that day.</span> The LXX. and Vulgate avoid the difficulty here by referring these words to what goes before - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the promise made to Caleb. In that case we must render the second <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> "for," instead of "that," or "how." Joshua can hardly have heard for the first time that the Anakim were in Hebron if, as <a href="/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a> appears to assert, he, in common with the other spies, had visited the place. But it is possible, though the narrative as it stands seems to suggest that they went together, that the spies went different ways, either separately or in pairs, and that Caleb visited Hebron, and that Joshua heard the account of it for the first time from Caleb's lips, as they brought their report to Moses, and that Caleb then asked and received the grant of Hebron. We may observe the minute agreement here in matters of detail between the Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua. The Pentateuch states that the spies visited Hebron. The Book of Joshua, without mentioning this, makes Caleb appeal to Joshua as a witness that a premise had been made to him, long before the entrance of Israel into the promised land, that this particular place should be allotted to him. The description of Hebron also in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>. agrees in every respect with what is stated here. <span class="cmt_word">Fenced</span>.
