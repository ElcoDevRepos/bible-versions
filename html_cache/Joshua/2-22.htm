This area provided natural cover and was a strategic choice for evading capture. The spies' journey into the hill country reflects the wisdom and guidance they received, possibly indicating divine protection. The choice of the hill country also connects to the broader biblical theme of God using the natural world to accomplish His purposes, as seen in other instances like David hiding from Saul in the wilderness.<p><b>and stayed there three days</b><br>The duration of three days is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing a period of testing, waiting, or preparation. This time frame allowed the spies to avoid detection and ensured the safety of their mission. The number three is frequently associated with divine completeness or resurrection, as seen in the three days Jonah spent in the fish and Jesus' resurrection on the third day, suggesting a period of divine intervention and fulfillment.<p><b>until their pursuers had returned</b><br>The pursuers were likely soldiers or scouts sent by the king of Jericho to capture the spies. Their return without success highlights the failure of human efforts against God's plans. This phrase underscores the theme of divine providence and protection over those who are part of God's mission, as seen throughout the Bible in stories like that of Daniel in the lions' den.<p><b>without finding them</b><br>This outcome emphasizes the effectiveness of the spies' strategy and God's protection over them. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God thwarting the plans of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-13</a>, where the Lord laughs at the wicked because He knows their day is coming. The inability of the pursuers to find the spies serves as a testament to God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will.<p><b>having searched all along the road</b><br>The road likely refers to the main routes leading to and from Jericho, which would have been the logical paths for the spies to take. The thorough search by the pursuers indicates the seriousness of the threat posed by the spies and the determination of Jericho's king to protect his city. This detail highlights the tension and danger of the mission, as well as the miraculous nature of the spies' escape, reminiscent of other biblical escapes, such as Peter's release from prison in <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Two men sent by Joshua to scout the land of Jericho.
