In the context of ancient warfare, this was a common practice among the Israelites, signifying that the victory and spoils belonged entirely to God. Jericho, as the first city conquered in the Promised Land, was to be a firstfruits offering to God. This act of devotion underscores the holiness and sovereignty of God, demanding total obedience and the removal of anything that could lead Israel into idolatry. The destruction of Jericho also serves as a judgment against the Canaanite culture, which was steeped in practices detestable to God, such as idolatry and immorality.<p><b>Only Rahab the prostitute and all those with her in her house will live,</b><br>Rahab's inclusion highlights God's grace and the power of faith. Despite her background, Rahab's faith in the God of Israel (as seen in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>) led to her and her family's salvation. This act of mercy prefigures the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community, as seen in the New Testament. Rahab is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>), illustrating God's redemptive plan through history. Her house, marked by the scarlet cord, symbolizes protection and deliverance, akin to the Passover lamb's blood in Exodus.<p><b>because she hid the spies we sent.</b><br>Rahab's actions demonstrated her faith and allegiance to the God of Israel. By hiding the spies, she risked her life, showing a commitment to God's purposes over her own people. This act of faith is commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a> and <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>, where Rahab is praised for her works as evidence of her faith. Her story exemplifies the biblical principle that faith without works is dead, and it serves as a powerful testimony of how God can use unlikely individuals to fulfill His divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>A fortified city in Canaan, the first city conquered by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership.

The verse calls readers to devote everything to the LORD, shun what He condemns, and cling to the saving faith that transforms outcasts into family.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The city shall be accursed.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">shall be cherem, </span>"a devoted or accursed thing"; and so <a href="/joshua/6-18.htm" title="And you, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make yourselves accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.">Joshua 6:18</a>, "from the accursed thing." (See Note on <a href="/deuteronomy/7-26.htm" title="Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>.) The combination of the two ideas of devotion to God and utter destruction may be seen in the sin offering (<a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.">Leviticus 6:25</a>), which is called "holy of holies," or most holy, and yet, when offered for the priest or congregation, must be utterly consumed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word"> Accursed.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">devotea</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> LXX. The original meaning of this word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5dd;</span> to "shut up." Hence it originally means "a net." With this we may compare the well known Eastern word <span class="accented">harem</span>, meaning the enclosed apartments reserved for the women of the family. Hence it comes to mean <span class="accented">under a ban, devoted</span>, generally to utter destruction under the pressure of a vow to God, as in <a href="/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2</a>, or in consequence of His command (see <a href="/leviticus/27-29.htm">Leviticus 27:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/13-15.htm">Deuteronomy 13:15</a> (Hebrew 16); <a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>, "the man of my <span class="accented">devoting,"</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, etc). But in <a href="/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>, <a href="/numbers/18-14.htm">Numbers 18:14</a>, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5de;</span> as devoted to the Lord, became the property of the priest. This ban was the most solemn and tremendous religious sentence, the absolute and final excommunication of the old law. The sin of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.) was the sparing of anything whatever in the city which had been laid under the ban - a ban which Saul had been specially commanded to execute (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>) according to the principles laid down in <a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a>. When Keil, however, states that the ban "could never be pronounced upon things and property alone, but only upon open idolaters, either with or without their possessions," he appears to have overlooked <a href="/leviticus/27-16.htm">Leviticus 27:16-21</a>, where a man may devote irredeemably to God property of <span class="accented">his own</span> (cf. ver. 28 of the same chapter). In his subsequent work, however, Keil qualifies this assertion by a consideration of this very passage. Idolatrous worship was the one thing which justified the Israelites in laying one of their own cities under the ban (see <a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12</a> 18, above cited). But (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>) it had been pronounced against the Canaanites. Property, how. ever, save in the case of Jericho, seems to have been exempted from the ban (see <a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>). Even at Jericho the silver and the gold, the brass and the iron, were placed in the treasury of the Lord (Joshua 5:19, 24). "Why," says Theodoret, "was the city thus devoted? It was devoted on the same principle which offered the first fruits to God, since it was the first fruits of their conquests." Because she hid.
