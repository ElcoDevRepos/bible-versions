In ancient times, wineskins were made from animal hides and were used to store wine. New wineskins were necessary because they could expand as the wine fermented. The mention of "new" wineskins suggests the Gibeonites' attempt to appear as if they had traveled a long distance, as new wineskins would not typically crack unless subjected to extensive use. This deception is part of a larger narrative where the Gibeonites seek to make a treaty with Israel, fearing the Israelites' God-given mandate to conquer the land.<p><b>but look, they are cracked</b><br>The cracked wineskins serve as physical evidence to support the Gibeonites' story. In the cultural context, cracked wineskins would indicate age and wear, reinforcing the idea of a long journey. This detail is crucial in the narrative, as it plays into the Israelites' decision to believe the Gibeonites without seeking God's counsel. The cracked wineskins symbolize the fragility of human plans and the ease with which appearances can deceive. This moment foreshadows the importance of seeking divine guidance in decision-making, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible.<p><b>And these clothes and sandals are worn out</b><br>The worn-out clothes and sandals further the Gibeonites' ruse, suggesting a lengthy and arduous journey. In the ancient Near East, clothing and footwear were valuable and not easily replaced, so their condition would be a significant indicator of travel. This imagery connects to the Israelites' own experience in the wilderness, where God miraculously preserved their clothing and sandals (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-5.htm">Deuteronomy 29:5</a>). The contrast highlights the Gibeonites' deception and the Israelites' failure to discern the truth.<p><b>from our very long journey.&#8221;</b><br>The claim of a "very long journey" is central to the Gibeonites' strategy to secure a peace treaty with Israel. This phrase emphasizes the supposed distance they have traveled, aiming to convince the Israelites of their sincerity and non-threatening nature. The narrative underscores the theme of discernment and the consequences of failing to seek God's guidance. The Gibeonites' deception ultimately leads to their servitude to Israel, fulfilling God's promise to give the land to the Israelites, yet also showing God's mercy in allowing the Gibeonites to live. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of spiritual vigilance and reliance on God&#8217;s wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeonites.htm">Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people from the city of Gibeon who deceived Joshua and the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them by pretending to be from a distant land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.

Their deliberate aging highlights how easily appearances can be manipulated (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; New wineskins elsewhere symbolize fresh, flexible readiness for God&#8217;s work (<a href="/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>; <a href="/mark/2-22.htm">Mark 2:22</a>), yet here the idea is twisted&#8212;what should have spoken of life is used to craft deception.<p>&#8226; Lesson: tangible proofs alone cannot replace seeking the Lord&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but look, they are cracked</b><p>&#8226; The cracks are produced evidence, meant to confirm the story of long travel. Ironically, a cracked container can no longer preserve what it holds, pointing to the emptiness of deceit (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s leaders judge by sight, repeating the error warned against in <a href="/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3</a>&#8212;relying on &#8220;eyes&#8221; rather than on God&#8217;s discernment.<p>&#8226; Cracked vessels also remind us of fallen humanity&#8217;s frailty; only truth keeps a vessel sound (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Lesson: when discernment is bypassed, even obvious flaws can be misread as authenticity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And these clothes and sandals are worn out from our very long journey.</b><p>&#8226; Torn garments and battered sandals complete the illusion. The description is literal&#8212;items were intentionally distressed to match the tale (<a href="/joshua/9-5.htm">Joshua 9:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast with <a href="/deuteronomy/29-5.htm">Deuteronomy 29:5</a>, where God preserved Israel&#8217;s clothing in the wilderness; here, worn articles underscore self-reliance and deception rather than divine provision.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses garments to signify spiritual conditions (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>). These tattered clothes picture a false humility designed to win sympathy.<p>&#8226; Lesson: external humility can mask internal dishonesty; truth must be tested against God&#8217;s word and guidance (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-13.htm">Joshua 9:13</a> records the Gibeonites&#8217; deliberate display of aged wineskins, cracked vessels, and worn clothing to convince Israel they had come from afar. The narrative is historically accurate and literally true, showing how persuasive appearances can be when God&#8217;s counsel is neglected. The passage warns believers to look beyond visible evidence, seek the Lord&#8217;s wisdom, and guard against deception that trades truth for convenience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/9-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1448;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wineskins</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1488;&#1491;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4997.htm">Strong's 4997: </a> </span><span class="str2">A skin bottle, skin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were new</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2319.htm">Strong's 2319: </a> </span><span class="str2">New</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when we filled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;l&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4390.htm">Strong's 4390: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fill, be full of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but look,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
