Her response demonstrates faith and trust in the God of Israel, aligning with <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>, which commends her faith. Rahab's agreement is a pivotal moment, showing her willingness to abandon her former life and align with God's people. This act of faith is significant in the biblical narrative, as it sets the stage for her inclusion in the lineage of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>).<p><b>and she sent them away.</b><br>Rahab's action of sending the spies away safely is crucial for the success of their mission. It highlights her role in God's plan for Israel's conquest of Jericho. This act of protection and assistance to the spies is reminiscent of the hospitality and protection offered by other biblical figures, such as Lot in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. Her actions demonstrate courage and wisdom, ensuring the spies' safe return to Joshua with vital information.<p><b>And when they had gone,</b><br>This phrase indicates the completion of the spies' mission in Jericho and their safe departure, thanks to Rahab's intervention. It underscores the importance of timing and obedience in God's plan. The spies' departure marks the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the Israelites, as seen in <a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a>.<p><b>she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</b><br>The scarlet cord is a symbol of Rahab's faith and the covenant between her and the spies. It serves as a sign for the Israelites to spare her and her family during the conquest of Jericho. The color scarlet is often associated with sacrifice and redemption, drawing a parallel to the blood of the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a> and foreshadowing the redemptive work of Christ. The act of tying the cord signifies Rahab's commitment to the agreement and her hope for salvation, making it a powerful symbol of faith and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho, known for her faith and actions in hiding the Israelite spies.
