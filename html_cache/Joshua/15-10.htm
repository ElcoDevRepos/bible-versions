It was a place where the Ark of the Covenant was kept for a time (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). The mention of Mount Seir here is not to be confused with the more famous Mount Seir associated with Edom. This Mount Seir is a lesser-known location within the boundaries of Judah. The westward curling of the border indicates a change in direction, marking a transition in the territorial demarcation.<p><b>ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon)</b><br>Mount Jearim, identified as Chesalon, is part of the Judean hill country. The northern slope would have been a significant geographical marker, providing a natural boundary. Chesalon is mentioned in other biblical texts as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah, emphasizing its importance in defining tribal territories. The use of both names suggests a dual identity or a change in name over time, which was common in ancient times.<p><b>went down to Beth-shemesh</b><br>Beth-shemesh, meaning "house of the sun," was a Levitical city within the territory of Judah. It played a role in the narrative of the Ark of the Covenant when it was returned by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12-15</a>). The city's location on the border of Judah and Dan made it strategically significant. Archaeological excavations have uncovered evidence of its ancient occupation, including fortifications and religious artifacts, underscoring its historical importance.<p><b>and crossed to Timnah</b><br>Timnah was a town on the border of Judah and Dan, known for its vineyards and as the place where Samson sought a Philistine wife (<a href="/judges/14.htm">Judges 14:1-2</a>). The crossing to Timnah indicates a continuation of the boundary line, marking the extent of Judah's territory.

Not the dwelling place of Esau, afterwards the country of the Edomites (<a href="/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>), but a range running southwestward from Kirjath-jearim, part of which is still known as Sairah, or Saris, "auf welchem <span class="accented">Saris</span> und <span class="accented">Mihsir</span> liegen" (Kuobel). Since Kirjath-jearim means the "city of the forests," and Seir means "hairy," we may conjecture that the name was given to the ridge on account of its wooded character.

The fact that the border passed northward of Chesalon is a confirmation of the view taken above. We learn from <a href="/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a> (cf. ver. 33 of this chapter), that the border passed by Zorah and Eshtaol in the Shephelah, through a neighbourhood described in Conder's Handbook as "an open corn country." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shemesh.</span> The "house of the sun," identified with the modern Ain (or fountain of) Shems.

The propinquity to the Philistines appears to have affected the principles of its inhabitants, and their conduct contrasts most unfavourably with that of the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim. This was the more disgraceful, in that Beth-shemesh (<a href="/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>) was a priestly city, and being inhabited by those whose "lips should keep knowledge," might have been expected to set a better example. It was required to furnish Solomon's household with provisions (<a href="/1_kings/4-9.htm">1 Kings 4:9</a>), it witnessed the defeat and capture of Amaziah (<a href="/2_kings/14-11.htm">2 Kings 14:11-13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21</a>) by Joash, king of Israel.
