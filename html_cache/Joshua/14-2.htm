Casting lots was seen as a way to discern God's will, as evidenced in <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>, which states, "The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD." This method ensured that the distribution of land was perceived as fair and divinely ordained, minimizing human bias or conflict. The use of lots is also seen in other biblical contexts, such as the selection of Saul as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20-24</a>) and the replacement of Judas Iscariot by Matthias (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>).<p><b>for the nine and a half tribes</b><br>The nine and a half tribes refer to the tribes of Israel that settled west of the Jordan River. This division occurred because the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had already received their inheritance east of the Jordan, as described in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>. The nine and a half tribes included Judah, Ephraim, Benjamin, Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, Dan, and the remaining half of Manasseh. This division highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>as the LORD had commanded through Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the continuity of God's covenantal promises and commands from Moses to Joshua. Moses, as the servant of the LORD, had received detailed instructions regarding the division of the land (<a href="/numbers/34-13.htm">Numbers 34:13-29</a>). Joshua's leadership in carrying out these commands demonstrates his role as Moses' successor and the importance of obedience to God's directives. This continuity is crucial for maintaining the unity and identity of the Israelite nation as they settle in the Promised Land. The command also reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs, reinforcing the theme of divine faithfulness throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, responsible for leading the Israelites into the Promised Land and overseeing the distribution of the land among the tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nine_and_a_half_tribes.htm">The Nine and a Half Tribes</a></b><br>Refers to the tribes of Israel that received their inheritance west of the Jordan River.

By the time we reach <a href="/bsb/joshua/14.htm">Joshua 14</a>, Israel has taken possession of Canaan&#8217;s key strongholds, and now the promised land is being distributed. The word reminds us:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promises are tangible and traceable&#8212;He gives real territory, not merely abstract blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; An inheritance is a family matter. Every clan will settle, farm, raise children, and worship on soil God specifically picked for them (<a href="/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The distribution signals completion of a long, wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>), showing that God finishes what He starts (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was assigned by lot</b><p>Casting lots may sound random, but in Scripture it is a divinely guided process (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).

Every tribe sees that the Lord controls the lots, fulfills His word, and unites His people across the Jordan.

Of Ephraim and Manasseh, Jacob had said to Joseph, "as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine:" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> though grandsons, they shall count as sons of Jacob, and each one shall be the head of a tribe. Thus there are two ways of counting Jacob's sons, each making twelve; and these two seem to be recognised as distinct in Exodus 28. There we are told that the high priest should bear the names of the children of Israel on his shoulders <span class= "ital">according to their birth </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Joseph being counted as well as Levi, but not Ephraim and Manasseh). On his breastplate he must have them <span class= "ital">according to the twelve tribes </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Ephraim and Manasseh being specified, but Joseph and Levi left out). Both ways of reckoning were necessary in order that the complete Israel might be represented by the high priest. And in each way the number <span class= "ital">twelve </span>was preserved and emphasised, as it is evidently intended to be in this place,<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By lot was their inheritance.</span> The commentators, following the Rabbis, have amused themselves by speculations <span class="accented">how</span> the lot was taken. The question is of no great practical importance; but no doubt the contrivance was a very primitive one, as the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> a small pebble, used here, seems to imply. What is of more importance is the fact that the distribution of territory was the result of no one's caprice, or ambition, or intrigue. The whole matter was referred to God, and the leader of the Israelitish hosts and the high priest presided over the ceremony. It was a common belief among the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, that the use of the lot was to refer the matter to a Divine decision. So we read in the Proverbs, "The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord" (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>; cf. 18:18). It is a strong evidence for the truth of this narrative that we read of no conflicts between the various tribes respecting the division of territory. Jealousies sprung up between the tribes, as the narratives in <a href="/judges/8.htm">Judges 8, 9, 12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>, are sufficient to show. But in no one case was there any complaint of unfairness, any attempt to disturb the territorial arrangement made at the time of the original settlement in Palestine. There can be little doubt that Keil is right in supposing this original division to have been in outline merely. It is obvious from the onward course of the narrative (especially ch. 18.) that no very minute accuracy in detail could possibly have been arrived at. The country was roughly mapped out at first, and the complete adjustment of boundaries was a matter which would naturally be put off until the land were actually in possession. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/14-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Their inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
