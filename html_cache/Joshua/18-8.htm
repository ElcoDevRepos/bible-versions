The men referred to are representatives from the seven tribes of Israel who had not yet received their inheritance. This action follows Joshua's earlier instructions, demonstrating their willingness to fulfill God's command to possess the land. It reflects a transition from a period of waiting to active participation in God's plan.<p><b>Joshua commanded them to map out the land</b><br>Joshua, as the leader of Israel, gives a clear directive to the men. Mapping out the land was a practical step necessary for dividing the territory among the tribes. This task required careful observation and recording, emphasizing the importance of preparation and planning in fulfilling God's promises. It also highlights Joshua's role as a wise and strategic leader.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Go and survey the land, map it out, and return to me.</b><br>The repetition of the command underscores its importance. Surveying the land involved a detailed examination of its features, resources, and boundaries. This process ensured that the division of the land would be fair and based on accurate information. The instruction to return to Joshua signifies accountability and the need for centralized leadership in the distribution process.<p><b>Then I will cast lots for you here in Shiloh</b><br>Casting lots was a common biblical practice used to discern God's will. It reflects a reliance on divine guidance rather than human decision-making. Shiloh, where this event takes place, was the religious center of Israel at the time, housing the Tabernacle. This location underscores the sacred nature of the task and the presence of God in the decision-making process.<p><b>in the presence of the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the spiritual dimension of the land distribution. Conducting the casting of lots in the presence of the LORD signifies that the process is not merely administrative but a divine ordinance. It reflects the belief that God is actively involved in the affairs of His people and that His presence sanctifies the proceedings. This also serves as a reminder of God's covenant with Israel and His faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land and overseeing its division among the tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men.htm">The Men</a></b><br>Representatives from the tribes of Israel who were sent to survey the land to ensure a fair distribution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>A significant religious and cultural center for the Israelites at the time, where the tabernacle was located and where the lots were cast.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which was to be divided among the tribes of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/casting_lots.htm">Casting Lots</a></b><br>A method used to discern God's will in the distribution of the land, ensuring that the division was seen as divinely ordained.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_leadership.htm">Obedience to Leadership</a></b><br>Joshua's command to the men to survey the land demonstrates the importance of following godly leadership.
