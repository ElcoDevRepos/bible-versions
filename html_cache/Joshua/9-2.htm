In the ancient Near East, it was common for smaller kingdoms to form alliances to strengthen their military capabilities against a common enemy. This reflects the political landscape of Canaan during the time of Joshua, where city-states were often in conflict but could unite against a larger threat. The unity of these groups highlights the perceived threat of Israel's presence in the land.<p><b>to wage war</b><br>The intent to wage war signifies a direct opposition to the Israelites' conquest of Canaan, as commanded by God. This opposition is not just a physical battle but also a spiritual one, as the Canaanites' resistance is against God's plan for Israel. The concept of war in the Old Testament often carries a dual meaning, involving both physical and spiritual dimensions. This phrase also foreshadows the numerous battles Israel would face in claiming the Promised Land.<p><b>against Joshua</b><br>Joshua, as the leader of Israel, is the primary target of this coalition. His leadership is central to the conquest of Canaan, and his role is a continuation of Moses' mission. Joshua's name, meaning "The Lord is salvation," is significant as he leads the people into the Promised Land, prefiguring Jesus Christ, who leads believers into spiritual rest and salvation. The opposition against Joshua can be seen as a type of the opposition Christ faced.<p><b>and Israel</b><br>Israel represents the people of God, chosen to inherit the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The mention of Israel alongside Joshua emphasizes the collective identity and mission of the nation. This phrase underscores the unity and shared purpose of the Israelites under Joshua's leadership. The opposition they face is not just against an individual but against the entire covenant community, reflecting the broader spiritual battle between God's people and the forces opposed to His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are entering the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_kings.htm">Canaanite Kings</a></b><br>Various kings of the land of Canaan who unite to oppose Israel's conquest of the land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, a region inhabited by various tribes and nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/coalition_of_kings.htm">Coalition of Kings</a></b><br>The alliance formed by the Canaanite kings to resist the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_opposition.htm">Unity in Opposition</a></b><br>The Canaanite kings united against a common threat, showing how opposition can bring together even disparate groups.
