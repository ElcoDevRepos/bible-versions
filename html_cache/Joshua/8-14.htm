This reflects the vigilance of city leaders during the conquest of Canaan, as they were aware of Israel's previous victories. The Israelites' presence would have been a significant threat, given their recent success at Jericho.<p><b>he hurried out early in the morning</b><br>The king's decision to act quickly suggests a sense of urgency and confidence, possibly due to the previous defeat of the Israelites at Ai (Joshua 7). Early morning was a strategic time for battle, taking advantage of the coolness of the day and the element of surprise.<p><b>with the men of the city</b><br>This phrase indicates that the king mobilized all available fighting men, showing the seriousness of the threat perceived. It also highlights the communal nature of warfare in ancient times, where city inhabitants were directly involved in defense.<p><b>to engage them in battle</b><br>The king's intent was to confront the Israelites directly, likely expecting a similar outcome to the previous encounter. This reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of meeting enemies in open battle rather than relying solely on city defenses.<p><b>at an appointed place</b><br>The phrase suggests a pre-determined location for battle, possibly a strategic site known for its tactical advantages. This could indicate a level of planning and military strategy on the part of Ai's king.<p><b>overlooking the Arabah</b><br>The Arabah is a desert region south of the Dead Sea, extending to the Gulf of Aqaba. This geographical reference provides context for the battle's location, emphasizing the varied terrain the Israelites had to navigate during their conquest.<p><b>But he did not know that an ambush had been set up against him behind the city</b><br>This reveals the Israelites' strategic planning under Joshua's leadership, employing tactics such as ambush to overcome their enemies.
