It marks a significant transition in Israel's history, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The crossing of the Jordan is a pivotal event, akin to the crossing of the Red Sea, and signifies a new chapter for the nation under Joshua's leadership.<p><b>the LORD exalted Joshua</b><br>The exaltation of Joshua is a divine act, indicating God's approval and appointment of Joshua as the leader of Israel. This mirrors the way God had previously exalted Moses, establishing Joshua's authority and ensuring the people's confidence in his leadership. It underscores the theme of divine election and empowerment, as God chooses and equips leaders for His purposes.<p><b>in the sight of all Israel</b><br>This public exaltation ensures that the entire nation witnesses God's endorsement of Joshua. It is crucial for maintaining unity and obedience among the people, as they prepare to conquer the land. The visibility of this act reinforces the legitimacy of Joshua's leadership and serves as a unifying factor for the tribes of Israel.<p><b>and they revered him</b><br>The reverence shown to Joshua by the Israelites is a response to God's exaltation of him. It reflects the respect and obedience that the people are to have for God's chosen leader. This reverence is not merely personal admiration but is rooted in the recognition of God's authority working through Joshua.<p><b>all the days of his life</b><br>This phrase indicates the enduring nature of the respect and authority Joshua held among the Israelites. Unlike some leaders whose influence wanes, Joshua's leadership remains strong throughout his lifetime, suggesting his faithfulness and effectiveness in fulfilling God's commands.<p><b>just as they had revered Moses</b><br>The comparison to Moses highlights the continuity of leadership and the fulfillment of God's promises. Moses was a central figure in Israel's history, and his leadership set a standard for future leaders. By paralleling Joshua with Moses, the text emphasizes that Joshua is the rightful successor, continuing the mission of leading Israel into the Promised Land. This also points to the typology of Christ, as both Moses and Joshua serve as types of Christ, leading God's people to salvation and rest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the leader of the Israelites following Moses.

The verse underscores that true leadership is God-appointed, publicly authenticated, and instrumental in keeping God&#8217;s people aligned with His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">All the days of his life.</span>--This ends the section, as appears by comparison with <a href="/joshua/3-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.">Joshua 3:7</a>.

But it was, nevertheless, one important result of it. Joshua was the appointed leader of the Israelites, and he was under God's special protection and guidance. But however much God may overrule our human nature to His own purposes, He never abrogates the laws of its working. Confidence in a leader, from a human point of view, is one of the most essential requisites for success in war. Therefore in the crossing of the Jordan we find Joshua directing all the operations, though the direction of affairs might have been put into other hands, that of Eleazar the high priest, for instance. But this was the public attestation of the secret intimation God had given Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>): "As I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not fail thee nor forsake thee." From this point onward we see no signs of hesitation on the part of the Israelites; nothing but the most unwavering confidence in the Divine mission, as well as in the extraordinary natural gifts, of their leader. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
