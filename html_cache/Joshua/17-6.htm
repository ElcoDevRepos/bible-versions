This was unusual in ancient Israelite culture, where inheritance typically passed through male descendants. The daughters of Zelophehad&#8212;Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah&#8212;approached Moses and Eleazar the priest, requesting a share of the inheritance since their father had no sons (<a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>). God instructed Moses to grant their request, setting a precedent for inheritance rights for women in Israel. This event underscores the importance of justice and equity in God's law and reflects God's care for all His people, regardless of gender. It also foreshadows the New Testament principle of equality in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.</b><br>Gilead was a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain. It was part of the territory allocated to the half-tribe of Manasseh, which settled on the east side of the Jordan, along with the tribes of Reuben and Gad (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1-5, 33</a>-42). The allocation of Gilead to the rest of the sons of Manasseh indicates the division of land among the tribe, with some settling east of the Jordan and others west. This division reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) and demonstrates the complexity of tribal inheritances in Israel. The land of Gilead later became significant in biblical history, serving as a backdrop for events involving figures like Jephthah (Judges 11) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughters_of_manasseh.htm">Daughters of Manasseh</a></b><br>These are the female descendants of Manasseh, one of the tribes of Israel.
