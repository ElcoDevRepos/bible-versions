Asher's territory was located in the northern part of Canaan, along the Mediterranean coast. This region was known for its fertile land and olive oil production, fulfilling Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, which speaks of Asher's food being rich and providing royal delicacies. The tribe's location and resources played a significant role in its economic prosperity.<p><b>they were given</b><br>This phrase refers to the allocation of cities to the Levites, who were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a specific territory like the other tribes. Instead, they were given cities within the territories of the other tribes. This distribution ensured that the Levites were spread throughout Israel, facilitating their role in teaching the Law and maintaining the spiritual life of the nation. This system also fulfilled the command in <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-8</a>, where God instructed Moses to allocate cities to the Levites.<p><b>Mishal</b><br>Mishal was a city located in the territory of Asher. Its exact location is uncertain today, but it is believed to have been near the Mediterranean coast. The allocation of Mishal to the Levites highlights the integration of religious leaders within the community, ensuring that spiritual guidance was accessible to all Israelites. The presence of Levites in Mishal would have provided the inhabitants with instruction in the Law and oversight of religious practices.<p><b>Abdon</b><br>Abdon was another city given to the Levites within the territory of Asher. Like Mishal, its precise location is not definitively known, but it is thought to have been situated in the northern part of Asher's territory. The inclusion of Abdon in the list of Levitical cities underscores the importance of having spiritual leaders distributed throughout the land. This arrangement allowed the Levites to fulfill their role as mediators between God and the people, offering sacrifices and teaching the commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_asher.htm">Tribe of Asher</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Asher, the eighth son of Jacob and Zilpah.
