The number ten is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or the entirety of a group. The sending of ten chiefs underscores the seriousness of the situation and the desire for a comprehensive representation of the Israelite community. This action reflects the communal decision-making process in ancient Israel, where leaders were chosen to represent the collective interests of the tribes.<p><b>one family leader from each tribe of Israel,</b><br>The selection of one leader from each tribe emphasizes the unity and equality among the tribes of Israel. Each tribe had its own distinct identity and leadership, yet they were all part of the larger covenant community. This structure of leadership is reminiscent of the organization seen in the wilderness journey, where tribal leaders played crucial roles in guiding and managing the people (<a href="/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4-16</a>). It also highlights the importance of family and tribal affiliations in ancient Israelite society, where leadership was often hereditary and based on lineage.<p><b>each the head of a family among the clans of Israel.</b><br>The term "head of a family" indicates a position of authority and respect within the clan structure. In ancient Israel, clans were sub-divisions of tribes, and family heads were responsible for the welfare and representation of their extended families. This hierarchical structure ensured that decisions were made with consideration for the needs and perspectives of all community members. The involvement of family heads in this delegation underscores the gravity of the situation and the need for a resolution that would maintain the unity and purity of worship among the Israelites. This structure also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the church as a family of believers, with Christ as the head (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas.htm">Phinehas</a></b><br>The son of Eleazar the priest, Phinehas is a key figure in this chapter, leading the delegation to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

The actual head of each tribe accompanied him; that is, the head of the family, as we should call it, in each tribe. This seems preferable to Keil's idea, that some tribes were represented by a prince, and some by heads of families, which seems inadmissible from the fact that the Hebrew states that each tribe was represented in the same manner, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>.
