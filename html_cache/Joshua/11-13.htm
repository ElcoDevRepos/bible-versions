The "mounds" refer to ancient fortified cities often built on elevated ground, known as "tells." These cities were typically well-defended and served as administrative centers. The decision not to burn these cities suggests a desire to preserve them for future use, reflecting a practical approach to settlement and governance. This restraint aligns with God's instructions to Israel to inherit the land and its cities (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-11</a>), emphasizing the continuity of civilization under new leadership.<p><b>except Hazor,</b><br>Hazor was a significant Canaanite city, often considered the head of all those kingdoms (<a href="/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). Its destruction was unique and symbolically important. Archaeological evidence supports the biblical account, showing a layer of destruction at Hazor dating to the Late Bronze Age. The burning of Hazor signifies a decisive victory over a major power in the region, demonstrating God's deliverance and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel. Hazor's destruction also serves as a warning against idolatry and rebellion against God, themes prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>which Joshua burned.</b><br>Joshua's role as the leader of Israel is highlighted here, emphasizing his obedience to God's commands and his role as a military leader. The act of burning Hazor can be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment against the Canaanites, who were known for their idolatry and moral corruption (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). This act also prefigures the ultimate judgment and purification that Christ will bring, as Joshua (Yeshua in Hebrew) is a type of Christ, leading God's people into the promised inheritance. The destruction of Hazor underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and the establishment of His kingdom through His chosen leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses.

Rather, <span class="accented">on their hill</span> ("in collibus et in tumulis sitae," Vulg.). As many of the towns in Italy, and the castles in Germany in the middle ages, so these Phoenician cities were placed upon hills, that they might be more easily defended. The various tribes of Palestine were no doubt continually at war, and, as regards these northern tribes at least, were not accustomed to subsist by commerce. Therefore each of these cities stood (the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span> surely implies <span class="accented">situation</span> here) on its own hill, a detail possibly obtained from an eyewitness, who was probably struck by this feature of the district, a feature he had not observed before. The expression is used, however, as Masius observes, by Jeremiah (Joshua 30:18). Knobel observes that all the early versions have no suffix here. What he calls the "free translation," however, of the LXX. (which has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) requires the suffix, though the Vulgate requires none. We must not adopt the very plausible explanation of Knobel and others that Joshua burnt the cities in the valleys, but spared the cities on the hills, because they could be more easily defended (see <a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>; <a href="/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19, 34</a>), since we read that Hazor alone was burnt. The word here translated hill (<span class="accented">Tell</span>, Arabic) is one with which we are familiar in the modern name of places in Palestine (see note on Joshua 8:28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/11-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(raq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7535.htm">Strong's 7535: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, even, except, howbeit howsoever, at the least, nevertheless</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">burn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
