The long blast signifies a divine announcement, indicating God's direct intervention. The use of the shofar here connects to the idea of God's presence and power leading the Israelites.<p><b>and you hear its sound</b><br>Hearing the sound of the shofar was a call to action for the Israelites. It required attentiveness and obedience, reflecting the importance of listening to God's commands. This moment emphasizes the need for faith and trust in God's plan, as the Israelites were to act upon hearing the sound without hesitation.<p><b>have all the people give a mighty shout</b><br>The shout represents a unified act of faith and obedience. It symbolizes the collective trust of the Israelites in God's promise to deliver Jericho into their hands.
