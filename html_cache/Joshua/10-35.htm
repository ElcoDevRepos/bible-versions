The capture of Eglon was part of Joshua's southern campaign, which was a strategic move to secure the land promised to Israel. The rapid conquest of Eglon demonstrates the effectiveness of Joshua's military strategy and the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over their enemies. This event is part of the larger narrative of the Israelites taking possession of the Promised Land, as commanded by God.<p><b>and put it to the sword</b><br>The phrase "put it to the sword" indicates a complete military victory, where the inhabitants of the city were killed. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, often intended to prevent future rebellion and to demonstrate total dominance. In the context of the Israelite conquest, it also served as a means of purging the land of idolatry and pagan practices, in accordance with God's instructions to Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>.<p><b>and Joshua devoted to destruction everyone in the city</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" translates the Hebrew word "herem," which refers to the complete consecration of something to God, often through its destruction. This was a divine command given to ensure that the Israelites would not be influenced by the Canaanite's idolatrous practices. It reflects the seriousness of maintaining the purity of worship and obedience to God. This act also prefigures the final judgment, where sin and rebellion are completely eradicated.<p><b>just as he had done to Lachish</b><br>Lachish was another key city in the southern campaign, and its destruction set a precedent for the treatment of other Canaanite cities. The mention of Lachish serves to remind the reader of the consistency and thoroughness of Joshua's campaign. It also highlights the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, as each victory reinforced the certainty of God's word. The destruction of Lachish and Eglon can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where He will establish His kingdom in righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, chosen to inherit the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eglon.htm">Eglon</a></b><br>A city in Canaan that was captured and destroyed by the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lachish.htm">Lachish</a></b><br>Another Canaanite city previously conquered by Joshua and the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' actions at Eglon demonstrate their obedience to God's specific instructions.
