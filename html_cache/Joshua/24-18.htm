The Israelites attribute their victories to divine intervention rather than their own military prowess. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The driving out of nations is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing God's sovereignty and faithfulness. It also serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to divine assistance.<p><b>including the Amorites who lived in the land</b><br>The Amorites were one of the prominent Canaanite tribes inhabiting the land before the Israelite conquest. Historically, the Amorites were known for their fortified cities and advanced culture. Their mention here underscores the significant challenge they posed to the Israelites. The defeat of the Amorites is a testament to God's power and the fulfillment of His promise to give Israel the land. This also connects to earlier biblical narratives, such as the defeat of Sihon and Og, Amorite kings, in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>, which demonstrated God's might and set the stage for the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>We too will serve the LORD</b><br>This declaration by the Israelites is a reaffirmation of their commitment to the covenant with God. It echoes the covenant renewal ceremony at Shechem, where Joshua challenges the people to choose whom they will serve (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14-15</a>). The people's response indicates their recognition of God's past deeds and their desire to remain faithful. This commitment is crucial for maintaining their identity as God's chosen people and ensuring His continued favor and protection.<p><b>because He is our God!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal relationship between the Israelites and God. It reflects the covenantal bond established at Sinai, where God declared, "I will be your God, and you will be My people" (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). The acknowledgment of God as "our God" signifies exclusive worship and allegiance, rejecting the gods of the surrounding nations. This personal and communal relationship with God is foundational to Israel's identity and mission. It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers as God's people through faith in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered them from Egypt and led them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who is addressing the Israelites in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are being reminded of God's faithfulness and their covenant obligations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amorites.htm">The Amorites</a></b><br>One of the Canaanite nations that inhabited the Promised Land before the Israelites conquered it.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, as demonstrated by His actions in driving out the nations before Israel.
