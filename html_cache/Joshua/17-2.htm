Manasseh, along with Ephraim, received a significant inheritance in the Promised Land. This phrase indicates that the passage is detailing the specific land allotment for the remaining families within the tribe of Manasseh. Historically, the tribe of Manasseh was divided, with some settling east of the Jordan River and others west. This division reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land his descendants would inherit.<p><b>the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida.</b><br>These names represent the heads of families or clans within the tribe of Manasseh. Each clan received a portion of land, which was a common practice in ancient Israel to ensure that each family had a stake in the Promised Land. Abiezer is notable as the family from which Gideon, a judge of Israel, descended (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>). Shechem is also a significant city in biblical history, serving as a central location for various events, including the covenant renewal under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>). The mention of these clans highlights the importance of family lineage and inheritance in Israelite society.<p><b>These are the other male descendants of the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the patriarchal nature of inheritance in ancient Israel, where land was typically passed down through male descendants. Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, was given a double portion of inheritance through his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, as a reward for his faithfulness and leadership in Egypt. This allocation underscores the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Joseph's sons in <a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5-6</a>, where they are adopted as Jacob's own sons, thus receiving their own inheritance among the tribes of Israel. The reference to Joseph also serves as a reminder of God's providence and the continuity of His promises through generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Manasseh, the firstborn son of Joseph.

The word &#8220;allotment&#8221; underscores that the land is not seized by Israel&#8217;s ambition but distributed by the Lord&#8217;s directive (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida</b><p>Six family groups are named, echoing the census lists of <a href="/numbers/26-28.htm">Numbers 26:28&#8211;34</a>. Each clan will occupy a specific portion, ensuring that every line within Manasseh enjoys God-given inheritance. Noticeable details:<p>&#8226; Abiezer is later home to Gideon, whom the Angel of the LORD greets in Ophrah (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Shechem recalls the historic city where Abraham built an altar (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6&#8211;7</a>) and where Joshua will renew covenant vows (<a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Hepher is the ancestor of Zelophehad&#8217;s daughters, whose appeal for land clarified that inheritance may pass through faithful women (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>By listing these names, Scripture reinforces both God&#8217;s faithfulness to families and His meticulous record-keeping (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These are the other male descendants of the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph</b><p>The phrase &#8220;other male descendants&#8221; balances the earlier note about Zelophehad&#8217;s daughters, highlighting that while female heirs are honored, the customary patrilineal line continues (<a href="/numbers/36-1.htm">Numbers 36:1&#8211;12</a>). Mentioning &#8220;son of Joseph&#8221; ties the whole passage back to Genesis: Joseph&#8217;s faith that God would visit His people and give them the land (<a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24&#8211;25</a>) now finds visible fulfillment. Every allocation testifies that God&#8217;s covenant promises span generations (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a> confirms that God completes what He begins.
