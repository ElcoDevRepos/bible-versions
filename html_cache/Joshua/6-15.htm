This day marks the culmination of the Israelites' obedience to God's specific instructions for conquering Jericho, emphasizing the importance of divine timing and fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>they got up at dawn</b><br>Rising early demonstrates the Israelites' eagerness and readiness to follow God's command. This practice of early rising for significant events is seen throughout Scripture, such as Abraham rising early to obey God (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and Jesus rising early to pray (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>), indicating dedication and commitment to God's will.<p><b>and marched around the city seven times</b><br>The act of marching around Jericho seven times on the seventh day is a unique military strategy that underscores reliance on God's power rather than human strength. The number seven is often associated with divine completeness and perfection. This repetitive action also serves as a test of faith and obedience, reminiscent of Naaman's seven dips in the Jordan River for healing (<a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10-14</a>).<p><b>in the same manner</b><br>This phrase indicates consistency and faithfulness in following God's instructions.

It highlights the uniqueness of God's plan and the importance of following His specific instructions. The singularity of this event points to the extraordinary intervention of God, similar to other miraculous events in Scripture, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.

Israel rose with confident expectation, prepared to watch God act (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Dawn also underscores urgency: this was not a casual stroll but a decisive day in God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and marched around the city seven times</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and marched around the city seven times&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Seven signifies completeness (<a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>). By circling Jericho seven times, Israel enacted a visible declaration that God&#8217;s judgment was fully ripened and His promise to Abraham finally landing (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition impressed upon Israel&#8217;s hearts that victory comes by perseverance in God&#8217;s methods, not by shortcut (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>; <a href="/james/1-4.htm">James 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Naaman dipping seven times or Elijah&#8217;s servant scanning the horizon seven times (<a href="/1_kings/18-43.htm">1 Kings 18:43</a>), the action stretched faith right to the finish line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the same manner</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in the same manner.&#8221;<p>&#8226; They did exactly as on prior days&#8212;priests ahead, trumpets sounding, ark central, people silent (<a href="/joshua/6-6.htm">Joshua 6:6&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; God values precise obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32&#8211;33</a>).

If we seek His guidance by prayer, God will tell us when to do either. And when it is our duty not to do anything ourselves, but to wait for the deliverance which He never fails to send in His own good time, let us be careful to restrain ourselves, lest by our rash intermeddling with His designs, we bring disgrace and disaster upon ourselves and His cause. Had the Israelites disobeyed His command, and instead of the solemn procession round Jericho, ventured to attack the city at once, it would have fared worse with them than at Ai, or at the wilderness of Pavan (<a href="/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>). <span class="cmt_word">About the dawning.</span> So the Chethibh.
