If your tribe be as large as you say it is, it is capable of taking care of itself. There is the vast forest of Central Palestine before you. Do not complain to me, but go and take possession of it." <span class="cmt_word">Get thee up into the wood country.</span> The word "country" is not in the original, which is, strictly speaking, in the <span class="accented">direction</span> of the wood. Whether this be the "wood of Ephraim" mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6</a> has been much disputed. For not only David is related to have crossed the Jordan, but Absalom also, in hot pursuit of his father (see <a href="/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22, 24</a>). Neither army is mentioned as having recrossed the river; and it is a question whether it is more probable that there happened to be a "wood of Ephraim" on the other side of Jordan, or that Joab and Absalom, with their respective armies, recrossed Jordan without a word being said of the fact by the historian; the more especially as David (see <a href="/2_samuel/19-15.htm">2 Samuel 19:15-17, 31</a>) remained on the other side Jordan, while yet it was possible for the Ethiopian attendant, as well as Jonathan, to run to him with tidings of the defeat and death of Absalom. For the wood country in this neighbourhood cf. <a href="/psalms/132-6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>. Ewald would regard the language here as figurative, and the wood as referring to the powerful Phoenician tribes in the neighbourhood. He regards this answer as a sign of Joshua's "wit."
