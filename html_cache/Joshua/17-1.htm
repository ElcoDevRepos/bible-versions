The allotment refers to the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel, as directed by God through Moses and Joshua. Manasseh's inheritance was unique as it was divided on both sides of the Jordan River, reflecting the tribe's significant size and influence.<p><b>as Joseph&#8217;s firstborn son</b><br>Manasseh was the firstborn son of Joseph, one of the patriarchs of Israel. Joseph's sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, were adopted by Jacob as his own, granting them equal status with Jacob's other sons. This adoption effectively gave Joseph a double portion of inheritance, a privilege typically reserved for the firstborn, which was fulfilled through his sons.<p><b>namely for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh</b><br>Machir was the firstborn son of Manasseh and played a significant role in the tribe's history. His descendants, known as the Machirites, were prominent in the tribe of Manasseh. The emphasis on Machir highlights the importance of lineage and inheritance in Israelite society, where the firstborn often held a position of leadership and received a larger share of the inheritance.<p><b>and father of the Gileadites</b><br>The Gileadites were descendants of Machir, and they settled in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. This area was known for its balm, a valuable commodity in ancient times. The mention of the Gileadites underscores the tribal and familial connections that were central to Israelite identity and territorial claims.<p><b>who had received Gilead and Bashan</b><br>Gilead and Bashan were regions east of the Jordan River, known for their fertile land and strategic importance. The allocation of these lands to Machir's descendants reflects their military prowess and the fulfillment of God's promises to the tribes of Israel. These regions were also significant in biblical history, featuring in various battles and prophecies.<p><b>because Machir was a man of war</b><br>Machir's designation as a "man of war" indicates his and his descendants' military capabilities, which were crucial in conquering and securing the land. This warrior status was essential for the defense and expansion of Israel's territory. The emphasis on military strength highlights the challenges faced by the Israelites in establishing themselves in the Promised Land and the role of divine providence in their victories.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Joseph, one of the tribes of Israel.

Their identity is rooted in their ancestor&#8217;s faith-driven courage (<a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting Machir, Scripture reminds readers that God often raises up specific individuals to secure blessings for many (compare Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1&#8211;3</a>; David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had received Gilead and Bashan because Machir was a man of war</b><p>&#8220;who had received Gilead and Bashan because Machir was a man of war&#8221;<p>&#8226; The territory east of the Jordan&#8212;Gilead and Bashan&#8212;was awarded earlier when Machir&#8217;s sons conquered it (<a href="/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39&#8211;41</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;A man of war&#8221; underscores that faith is active. Trusting God&#8217;s promise led Machir to bold action against formidable foes like Og of Bashan (<a href="/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern mirrors <a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a> &#8212; &#8220;Every place on which the sole of your foot treads I have given you.&#8221; God gives; His people step out and possess.<p>&#8226; Future generations of Manasseh would continue to defend and cultivate these lands (<a href="/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29&#8211;31</a>; 17:5). Their story illustrates how obedience secures ongoing blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a> records more than a boundary line; it showcases covenant faithfulness. Joseph&#8217;s firstborn, Manasseh, receives the double portion promised long ago. Within that tribe, Machir&#8217;s courage wins Gilead and Bashan, proving that God honors valiant, obedient faith. The verse invites believers to trust every word of Scripture, confident that God still keeps His promises and equips His people to lay hold of them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was also a lot.</span> The preferable translation is, "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">the lot for the tribe of Manasseh - for he was the firstborn of Joseph - was</span> (<span class="accented">or fell</span>) <span class="accented">to Machir the son of Manasseh.</span> That is to say, the proper possession of the tribe of Manasseh fell to Machir and his descendants only, because of their warlike spirit, and possibly on account of their numbers also. They were sufficient to occupy the land of Gilead and Bashan, extensive and powerful though it was, while the rest of the tribe had a share in the inheritance westward of Jordan (see also <a href="/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For he was the firstborn of Joseph.</span> There has been much discussion why these words were introduced. It is probable that they are intended as an explanation of the existence of Ephraim and Manasseh as separate tribes; or possibly this is introduced to suggest the reason for mentioning the tribes in this order since Ephraim was not the firstborn (see <a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The father of Gilead.</span> There seems no reason to accept Keil's <span class="accented">dictum</span>, that because Gilead here has the article, whereas in other places where it signifies Machir's son it has not, the country and not the man is meant, and "father" must be taken as equivalent to "lord." The usage is found in Arabic and Ethiopic, but not in Hebrew. The reason why Gilead as the name of the individual has the article here is most likely because he gave his name to the territory mentioned immediately afterwards. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he had.</span> There is no "therefore" in the original, where we find "and he had." We must understand this as spoken of the tribe, not personally of Machir, who had been long dead (see note on Joshua 6:25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/17-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now this was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
