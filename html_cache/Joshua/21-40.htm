This allocation of cities ensured that the Merarites had a place to live and serve, emphasizing the importance of their role in the religious life of Israel.<p><b>the remaining Levite clans</b><br>The Levites were divided into three main families: the Gershonites, the Kohathites, and the Merarites. The phrase "remaining Levite clans" indicates that the Merarites were the last group to receive their cities, following the allocations to the other Levite families. This distribution underscores the organized and equitable manner in which the Israelites settled the Promised Land, ensuring that each clan had a place to fulfill their God-given roles. The Levites, as a whole, were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes, highlighting their unique position as mediators between God and the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/merarite_clans.htm">Merarite Clans</a></b><br>The Merarites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, descendants of Merari, the son of Levi.
