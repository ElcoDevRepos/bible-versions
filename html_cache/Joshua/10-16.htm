Their flight signifies a retreat in the face of Israel's divinely aided victory. This event follows the miraculous intervention where God extended the day for Joshua to defeat the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>).

The act of hiding in a cave suggests desperation and fear, contrasting with the confidence and faith of Joshua and the Israelites. This imagery of hiding in a cave can be seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as when David hid from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3</a>), highlighting a recurring theme of seeking refuge in times of distress.<p><b>at Makkedah</b><br>Makkedah is a city in the Shephelah region of Judah, known for its strategic location. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a fortified city, which would have made it a logical place for the kings to seek refuge. The choice of Makkedah as a hiding place underscores the futility of human plans against divine will, as God had already determined the outcome of the battle.

Dr. Maclear remarks on the number of caves in Palestine (see <a href="/genesis/19-30.htm">Genesis 19:30</a>; <a href="/judges/20-47.htm">Judges 20:47</a>), as well as the well-known caves of Adullam and Engedi (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>, 24:3), and the cave in which a hundred prophets were concealed by Obadiah (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>). Also see note on Joshua 2:22. But Lieut. Conder believes that in this particular neighbourhood there were few caves. See note on Makkedah above, ver. 10. For "these five kings" the original has simply "five kings." The order of the narrative is somewhat interrupted by the introduction of Joshua's adjuration, and the account of the flight of the five kings. Compare ver. 11 with ver. 20. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">five</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1461;&#1430;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2568.htm">Strong's 2568: </a> </span><span class="str2">Five</span><br /><br /><span class="word">kings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had fled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1467;&#1429;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;nu&#183;s&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5127.htm">Strong's 5127: </a> </span><span class="str2">To flit, vanish away</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and hidden</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2244.htm">Strong's 2244: </a> </span><span class="str2">To withdraw, hide</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the cave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;am&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4631.htm">Strong's 4631: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cavern</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at Makkedah.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;maq&#183;q&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4719.htm">Strong's 4719: </a> </span><span class="str2">Makkedah -- a place in Judah</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/10-16.htm">OT History: Joshua 10:16 These five kings fled and hid themselves (Josh.
