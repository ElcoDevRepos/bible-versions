The number thirteen is significant in biblical numerology, often associated with rebellion or sin, but here it signifies completeness in the provision for the Levites. This allocation is part of the broader distribution of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel, as detailed in the Book of Joshua.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The inclusion of pasturelands indicates the practical needs of the Levites, who required land to sustain their livestock. This provision underscores God's care for the daily needs of His servants. The pasturelands also symbolize the spiritual nourishment that the Levites were to provide for the people of Israel, as they were responsible for teaching the Law and leading worship.<p><b>were given to the Gershonite clans</b><br>The Gershonites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, descended from Gershon, the son of Levi. Their specific duties included the care of the tabernacle's fabrics and coverings, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25-26</a>. The allocation of cities to the Gershonites highlights the importance of their role in maintaining the worship and religious life of Israel. This distribution also reflects the broader theme of God's provision and order within the community, ensuring that each group had a place and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gershonites.htm">Gershonites</a></b><br>Descendants of Gershon, the firstborn son of Levi.
