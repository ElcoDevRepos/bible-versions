Zebulun, the sixth son of Jacob and Leah, is one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The inheritance signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land. Zebulun's territory is located in the northern part of Israel, which later becomes significant in the New Testament as the region of Galilee, where Jesus conducts much of His ministry. The prophecy in <a href="/genesis/49-13.htm">Genesis 49:13</a>, where Jacob blesses Zebulun, suggests a future maritime connection, which aligns with the tribe's proximity to the Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Galilee.<p><b>including these cities and their villages</b><br>The specific cities and villages within Zebulun's inheritance are detailed earlier in <a href="/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19</a>. These settlements are crucial for understanding the socio-economic structure of the tribe, as they provide the necessary resources and infrastructure for the community. Archaeological findings in this region, such as ancient ruins and artifacts, offer insights into the daily life and culture of the inhabitants. The cities serve as centers of trade, governance, and worship, reflecting the tribe's integration into the broader Canaanite landscape. The mention of cities and villages underscores the organized and communal nature of Israelite society, as well as the importance of land in establishing identity and fulfilling divine promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebulunites.htm">Zebulunites</a></b><br>The descendants of Zebulun, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

Possibly the fact that the "lines" of this tribe had "fallen in pleasant places," had tended to induce sloth. Certain it is that we hear but little of this tribe in the after history of Israel. They were not, like Reuben, absent from the great battle of Tabor, for there we read that, like Issachar, they "jeoparded their lives unto the death" for their homes and liberties. Yet though they seem thenceforth to have slackened in their zeal, theirs was a fair portion. It bordered on the slopes of Tabor, and seems (though the fact is not mentioned here) to have extended to the Sea of Galilee, as we may gather from <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/19-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1435;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was the inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5159.htm">Strong's 5159: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something inherited, occupancy, an heirloom, an estate, patrimony, portion</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the clans</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
