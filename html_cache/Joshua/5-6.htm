This period corresponds to the time it took for the disobedient generation to die off, as a consequence of their lack of faith and rebellion against God (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). The number forty is often symbolic in the Bible, representing a period of trial or judgment, as seen in the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p><b>until all the nation&#8217;s men of war who had come out of Egypt had died</b><br>The "men of war" refers to the fighting men who were counted in the census at Sinai (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>). These were the men who had witnessed the miracles in Egypt and the crossing of the Red Sea but still doubted God's promise to give them the land of Canaan. Their death in the wilderness was a direct result of their lack of faith and refusal to enter the Promised Land when first commanded (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-30</a>).<p><b>since they did not obey the LORD</b><br>Disobedience to God is a recurring theme in the history of Israel. The refusal to enter the Promised Land was a significant act of disobedience, as it demonstrated a lack of trust in God's power and promises. This disobedience is highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/3-18.htm">Hebrews 3:18-19</a>, which warns believers against hardening their hearts and failing to enter God's rest due to unbelief.<p><b>So the LORD vowed never to let them see the land</b><br>God's vow is a solemn declaration of judgment against the disobedient generation. This vow underscores the seriousness of their rebellion and the consequences of not trusting in God's promises. It serves as a reminder of God's holiness and justice, as well as His faithfulness to His word.<p><b>He had sworn to their fathers to give us</b><br>The land was promised to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;as part of God's covenant with them (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:3, 28:13). This promise was not nullified by the disobedience of the Exodus generation, but rather delayed until a faithful generation arose. The continuity of God's promise highlights His unchanging nature and the certainty of His covenantal commitments.<p><b>a land flowing with milk and honey</b><br>This phrase describes the fertility and abundance of the Promised Land, symbolizing prosperity and divine blessing. It is a recurring description of Canaan (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>) and serves as a metaphor for the richness of life under God's provision. The imagery of milk and honey suggests a land capable of sustaining livestock and agriculture, indicating both pastoral and agricultural wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and wandered in the wilderness for forty years due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert region where the Israelites wandered as a consequence of their lack of faith and disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_war.htm">Men of War</a></b><br>The generation of Israelite men who were of fighting age when they left Egypt but were not allowed to enter the Promised Land due to their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites through Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, described as "a land flowing with milk and honey," which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' forty-year journey in the wilderness serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God.

The forty years matched the forty days the spies had explored Canaan (<a href="/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>). Every sunrise in that desert underscored that sin has consequences and that God keeps His word, whether in promise or in discipline. Forty often marks periods of testing in Scripture&#8212;Moses on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>), Elijah on the way to Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), and Jesus in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1&#8211;2</a>). In each case, the lesson is the same: God is faithful and His people must learn to trust Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until all the nation&#8217;s men of war who had come out of Egypt had died</b><p>The generation that witnessed the plagues, the Red Sea crossing, and Sinai&#8217;s fire still refused to believe God could defeat the giants of Canaan (<a href="/bsb/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13&#8211;14</a>). Therefore, they died short of the promise, except Joshua and Caleb (<a href="/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>). Their graves scattered in the desert formed a visible reminder to the younger Israelites: unbelief forfeits blessings. <a href="/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14</a> records that the last of these warriors passed away before Israel crossed Moab, showing that God&#8217;s sentence was carried out to the letter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since they did not obey the LORD</b><p>Disobedience was the root, but the deeper issue was unbelief (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16&#8211;19</a>). They grumbled (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>), tested God (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>), and even threatened to stone Moses (<a href="/numbers/14-10.htm">Numbers 14:10</a>). Disobedience is never a mere mistake; it is a heart refusing to trust God&#8217;s goodness and power. First Samuel 15:22 reminds us that &#8220;to obey is better than sacrifice,&#8221; echoing the call that faith must be lived out in action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the LORD vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us</b><p>God&#8217;s oath of exclusion (<a href="/numbers/14-23.htm">Numbers 14:23</a>) sits beside His oath of inheritance to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; 26:3; 28:13). Both are equally certain. Divine promises are irrevocable, but participation in those promises can be forfeited by unbelief. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35&#8211;36</a> reiterates that only those who wholly followed the LORD would enter.

Yet the abundance was never an end in itself; it was meant to deepen Israel&#8217;s gratitude and obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7&#8211;10</a>). The same pattern carries into the New Testament, where believers are given &#8220;every spiritual blessing in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>) so that gratitude might fuel faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/5-6.htm">Joshua 5:6</a> explains why Israel camped on Canaan&#8217;s edge with a new generation ready for conquest. The verse looks back: forty years of wilderness wandering purged the disbelieving warriors. It highlights the cause: disobedience rooted in unbelief. It underscores God&#8217;s unbreakable word: He both withholds and bestows exactly as He promises. Finally, it points forward: the land of milk and honey still awaits those who trust and obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Us.</span>--The first person is used here as in <a href="/joshua/4-23.htm" title="For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until you were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:">Joshua 4:23</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-7.htm" title="And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.">Joshua 5:7</a>.

It is applied to the Israelites in <a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>; <a href="/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>. See also <a href="/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>. In the singular it means a people in the more general sense, a nation, as distinguished from a people in whom one has an interest. In the plural it always means the Gentiles. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span>. (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), the word usually applied to the people of God, is not used here, because the people who "provoked God in the wilderness" had made themselves in a sense a rejected people. Delitzsch regards this (after Calvin) as a sign that, for the time at least, the covenant between God and Israel was annulled, permanently in the case of those who were condemned to die in the wilderness, temporarily only in their descendants, who were formally reconciled to God, and restored to their former covenant position by this solemn performance of the covenant rite of circumcision (see note on verse 2). So also Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 205. The difficulty about the passover may be met by supposing that those only who were circumcised - a constantly decreasing number, of course - were allowed to celebrate that feast. Knobel would understand that in consequence of the "unquiet, unsettled, uncomfortable life" the Israelites led in the wilderness, they could keep very few of the ordained feasts. He continues: "the Elohist knows nothing of any cessation." Nevertheless we read of no passover being <span class="accented">kept</span> after the one recorded in <a href="/numbers/9-5.htm">Numbers 9:5</a>, so that if "the Elohist knows of no cessation," he knows as little of any continued observance of the feast. But there is no certainty on the point. Considering the loose way in which the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> is used in Scripture (see, for instance, <a href="/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>), we need not press the word to include <span class="accented">all</span> who were born after the departure from Egypt, but only those who were born after the rejection of the people recorded in <a href="/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> This rejection, be it remembered, did not include all the Israelites who were born in Egypt, but only those who were over twenty years of age (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a>). The view of Kurz (3:323, Clark's translation), that circumcision was suspended on account of the continual movements of the Israelites, is refuted by Delitzsch's remark that the Israelites were not continually on the march, but that they often encamped in one place for a long period, a period far longer, in fact, than the time in which they abode in Gilgal. Delitzsch asks why this circumcision did not take place before, why it was not performed as soon as they crossed the brook Zered. The answer is that, until the Jordan was crossed, they had not taken formal possession of their own land. As soon as, under the Divine protection, they had crossed the Jordan, the long-delayed promise was fulfilled. God's covenant with Abraham was accomplished, and now they, in their turn, had to place themselves once more in the position of God's covenant people, bound to serve Him with their whole heart. For a fuller discussion of this question see Keil's Commentary, and Hengstenberg in the passage cited above. We may observe that God fulfils His part of the covenant first, and then it is man's duty to fulfil his. God, under the Christian dispensation, first places us in the state of salvation. Then it becomes our duty to make that salvation sure by overcoming God's enemies, by the help which He never fails to afford. Give us. This introduction of the first person into the middle of the sentence is unexpected. Some MSS. and editors read "to them" (see note on ver. 1, and <a href="/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>, where there is a similar change of person). <span class="cmt_word">A land that floweth with milk and honey.</span> This, says Keil, "is a standing expression in the Pentateuch to express the great fertility of the land of Canaan. Milk and honey are produced by a land rich in grass and flowers, which were both of them plentiful in Canaan (see <a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15, 22</a>). Milk, not only of cows, but of sheep and goats also (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>), and eaten sometimes sweet, at other times thick or curdled (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>), was a leading article of food amongst the ancient Hebrews, as it is in the present day in most Eastern countries, and Palestine was peculiarly fitted for the rearing of cattle. Honey also, especially that of wild bees, was found in large quantities (<a href="/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a>, sqq.; <a href="/1_samuel/14-26.htm">1 Samuel 14:26</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), and is still found, notwithstanding its present desolate condition." Some have thought <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> to mean the newly expressed juice of grapes, which, under the Arabic name of <span class="accented">dibs</span>, is largely used at present in Palestine, and is even exported to other countries. But in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>, <a href="/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>, wild honey is clearly meant, which is to this day deposited by bees, in the clefts of the rock, whence it often overflows and is received into vessels placed beneath (see <a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a>; <a href="/songs/4-11.htm">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>; Jahn, 'Biblical Archaeology;' and Smith's Dictionary of the Bible.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;
