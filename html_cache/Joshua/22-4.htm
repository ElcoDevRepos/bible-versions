This rest is a significant theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing peace and security in the Promised Land. It echoes the rest God took on the seventh day of creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>) and foreshadows the spiritual rest found in Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>). The rest given to the Israelites is a tangible sign of God's faithfulness and covenantal promises.<p><b>as He promised them</b><br>This refers to the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). The fulfillment of these promises is a testament to God's unwavering faithfulness and serves as a reminder of His sovereignty and power. It also underscores the importance of obedience and faith in receiving God's blessings.<p><b>you may return to your homes</b><br>The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had fulfilled their commitment to help their fellow Israelites conquer the land west of the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20-22</a>). Their return signifies the completion of their duty and the unity among the tribes. It also reflects the importance of keeping one's word and the blessings that follow obedience to God's commands.<p><b>in the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you</b><br>This land east of the Jordan was allocated to these tribes by Moses as recorded in <a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>. Moses, as the servant of the LORD, acted under divine instruction, emphasizing the role of leadership in executing God's will. The land allocation was a strategic decision, providing these tribes with fertile land for their livestock and fulfilling God's plan for the distribution of the Promised Land.<p><b>across the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River served as a significant geographical and symbolic boundary for the Israelites. Crossing the Jordan represented entering into the Promised Land, a transition from the wilderness wanderings to a settled life. It also symbolizes spiritual transitions, such as moving from death to life, and is often associated with baptism in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). The land across the Jordan was part of God's provision and a testament to His promise-keeping nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel who fulfills His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites'_brothers.htm">The Israelites' Brothers</a></b><br>Refers to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh who had settled east of the Jordan River.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The servant of the LORD who led the Israelites out of Egypt and received the Law on Mount Sinai.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical boundary that separated the land given to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh from the rest of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>God fulfills His promises, as seen in the rest given to the Israelites.
