The shofar was often used to signal important events, such as the start of a battle or a call to worship. In this context, the sounding of the rams' horns signified the moment of divine intervention. The act of shouting by the people was an expression of faith and obedience to God's command, as instructed by Joshua. This moment reflects the power of collective faith and the importance of following divine instructions precisely.<p><b>When they heard the blast of the horn, the people gave a great shout,</b><br>The repetition of the horn blast and the people's shout emphasizes the unity and coordination among the Israelites. This event is a demonstration of faith in action, where the Israelites trusted in God's promise that the walls of Jericho would fall. The great shout can be seen as an act of worship and declaration of God's power. This moment parallels other biblical instances where vocal expressions of faith lead to divine intervention, such as in the story of Gideon (<a href="/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20-22</a>).<p><b>and the wall collapsed.</b><br>The collapse of Jericho's walls is a miraculous event attributed to God's direct intervention. Archaeological evidence suggests that Jericho was a fortified city with substantial walls, making their sudden collapse a significant demonstration of divine power. This event fulfilled God's promise to Joshua and the Israelites, showcasing that victory comes through faith and obedience to God rather than human strength or military might. Theologically, it represents the breaking down of barriers that stand against God's purposes.<p><b>Then all the people charged straight into the city and captured it.</b><br>The phrase indicates the immediacy and decisiveness of the Israelites' actions following the collapse of the walls. The capture of Jericho was the first major victory in the conquest of Canaan, symbolizing the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people over spiritual strongholds through faith and obedience. It also serves as a type of Christ's victory over sin and death, where seemingly insurmountable obstacles are overcome through divine power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.
