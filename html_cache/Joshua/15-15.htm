Joshua, leading the Israelites, is advancing to conquer the land promised to them by God. The context is the division of the land among the tribes of Israel, with Caleb, a key figure, taking initiative in this conquest. The march signifies obedience to God's command to take possession of the land.<p><b>against the inhabitants of Debir</b><br>Debir was a Canaanite city located in the hill country of Judah. The inhabitants were part of the broader Canaanite culture, which was characterized by polytheism and practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh. The conquest of Debir represents the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites the land and to drive out the Canaanite nations. This action also reflects the broader theme of God's judgment against the Canaanites for their idolatry and immorality.<p><b>(formerly known as Kiriath-sepher)</b><br>Kiriath-sepher, meaning "City of Books" or "City of Scribes," suggests that Debir may have been a center of learning or record-keeping. This name change signifies the transformation of the land under Israelite control, aligning with the biblical theme of new beginnings and the establishment of a society centered on the worship of Yahweh. The renaming of cities is a common biblical motif, symbolizing a shift in spiritual and cultural identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land and conquering it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/debir.htm">Debir</a></b><br>A city in the hill country of Judah, previously known as Kiriath-sepher, which means "City of Books" or "City of the Scribe."<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kiriath-sepher.htm">Kiriath-sepher</a></b><br>The former name of Debir, indicating its possible significance as a center of learning or record-keeping.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/caleb.htm">Caleb</a></b><br>Although not mentioned directly in this verse, Caleb is a key figure in the surrounding account, as he was given the task of conquering Debir.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inhabitants_of_debir.htm">Inhabitants of Debir</a></b><br>The people living in Debir, who were part of the Canaanite tribes that the Israelites were commanded to drive out.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_obedience.htm">Faithful Obedience</a></b><br>Caleb's actions in conquering Debir demonstrate faithful obedience to God's commands.

For believers, it pictures a life that refuses to stall after one triumph but keeps advancing in faith.<p>&#8226; The promise was clear, so Caleb moved.<p>&#8226; The ground already taken became the launching pad for the next objective.<p>&#8226; Faith celebrates past grace yet looks immediately to fresh assignments (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he marched</b><p>The verb captures energetic, purposeful movement. Caleb, now in his eighties (<a href="/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10-11</a>), acted with the confidence that the Lord still fought for him.
