His death marks the end of an era for the Israelites, as he was a key figure during the conquest of Canaan and the distribution of the land. Eleazar's role as high priest was crucial in maintaining the spiritual leadership and religious practices of the Israelites, as outlined in the books of Exodus and Leviticus. His death signifies a transition in leadership and a reminder of the mortality of even the most revered leaders.<p><b>and they buried him at Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah, in this context, is not to be confused with the more infamous Gibeah of Saul. This Gibeah is a location in the hill country of Ephraim. The act of burial in a specific location often held significant meaning, indicating a place of honor or familial connection. Burial practices in ancient Israel were deeply tied to family and tribal identity, and being buried in one's own land was considered a blessing and a sign of belonging.<p><b>which had been given to his son Phinehas</b><br>Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, is noted for his zealousness for God's covenant, as seen in <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, where he took decisive action against idolatry and immorality. His inheritance of Gibeah signifies the continuation of the priestly line and the blessings associated with faithfulness to God. The land given to Phinehas serves as a tangible representation of God's favor and the perpetuation of the priestly duties through his lineage.<p><b>in the hill country of Ephraim</b><br>The hill country of Ephraim was a central region in the land of Israel, known for its rugged terrain and strategic importance. Ephraim was one of the prominent tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph, and often played a significant role in the history of the nation. The location in Ephraim highlights the integration of the priestly line within the broader tribal structure of Israel, emphasizing the unity and shared heritage of the people. This region's significance is further underscored by its association with other key biblical figures and events, such as the leadership of Joshua, who was also from the tribe of Ephraim.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar.htm">Eleazar</a></b><br>The son of Aaron, Eleazar served as the high priest after Aaron's death.

The verse affirms that though leaders pass, the covenant stands, guiding Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;to trust the LORD who spans every generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">And Eleazar the son of Aaron died.</span>--"Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun," were the Moses and Aaron of this period. It is fitting that the Book of Joshua should close with the death of Eleazar, who was Joshua's appointed counsellor; for when Joshua was given as a shepherd to Israel, in answer to the prayer of Moses, Eleazar was also given to Joshua for a counsellor (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a>). At Eleazar's word he was to go out and come in, "both he and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation." It is rather singular that nothing but this has been recorded of Eleazar's personal history. Everything stated about him in his lifetime is official. Not a word that he uttered has been preserved.<p><span class= "bld">A hill. . . . given him in mount Ephraim.</span>--The inheritance of Phinehas as a priest would lie within the tribe of Judah (<a href="/joshua/21-13.htm" title="Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:13</a>, &c.) or Benjamin. This gift to Phinehas in Mount Ephraim, near the seat of government, seems to have been a special grant to him over and above his inheritance. But inasmuch as the tabernacle itself was at Shiloh, in Mount Ephraim, it was altogether suitable and natural that some place of abode should be assigned to the priests in that neighbourhood, where they were compelled to reside.<p>Although Phinehas himself was "zealous for his God," he lived to see the tribe of Benjamin nearly exterminated from Israel for repeating the sin of the Canaanites. (See <a href="/judges/20-28.htm" title="And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into your hand.">Judges 20:28</a>.) We can hardly say that the people served Jehovah all the days of Phinehas. With Eleazar and Joshua the spirit of strict obedience to the law seems to have, in a great measure, passed away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">A hill that pertained to Phinehas his son</span>. The LXX., Syriac, and Vulgate translate this as a proper name, Gibeath or Gabaath Phineas. But it may also mean Phinehas' hill. A city may or may not have been built there. Keil and Delitzsch believe it to be the Levitical town, Geba of Benjamin; but of this we cannot be sure. The tomb of Eleazar is still shown near Shechem, "overshadowed by venerable terebinths," as Dean Stanley tells us. And so the history ends with the death and burial of the conqueror of Palestine, the lieutenant of Moses, the faithful and humble servant of God, and of the successor of Aaron, who had been solemnly invested with the garments of his father before that father's death. A fitting termination to so strange and marvellous a history. With the death of two such men a new era had begun for the chosen people; a darker page had now to be opened. The LXX. adds to this passage, "In that day the children of Israel took the ark and carried it about among them, and Phinehas acted as priest, instead of Eleazar his father, until he died, and was buried in his own property at Gabaath. And the children of Israel went each one to his place and to his own city. And the children of Israel worshipped Astarte and Ashtaroth, the gods of the nations around them. And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Eglon king of the Moabites, and he had dominion over them eighteen years." The passage is an obvious compilation from the Book of Judges. It has no counterpart in the Hebrew, and the mention of Astarte and Ashtaroth as different deities is sufficient to discredit it. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/24-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Eleazar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;el&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;z&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
