Joshua, as the leader of Israel, is fulfilling the divine mandate to conquer the Promised Land. The unity of "all Israel with him" emphasizes the collective effort and obedience of the Israelites under Joshua's leadership. This unity is crucial for the success of their mission, reflecting the importance of communal faith and action in achieving God's purposes.<p><b>turned toward Debir</b><br>Debir, also known as Kiriath-Sepher, was a significant Canaanite city located in the hill country of Judah. Its name means "sanctuary" or "oracle," suggesting it may have been a center of religious or cultural importance. The strategic move to Debir follows the pattern of conquering key cities to establish control over the region. Archaeological evidence suggests Debir was a fortified city, indicating the challenge Joshua and the Israelites faced. The turning toward Debir signifies a deliberate and strategic decision in the conquest narrative.<p><b>and fought against it</b><br>The act of fighting against Debir is part of the broader conquest narrative where Joshua leads Israel in battles to claim the land promised to their ancestors. This phrase highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Canaanite inhabitants, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel the land. The warfare is not just physical but also spiritual, as it involves the overthrow of pagan practices and the establishment of a society centered on Yahweh. This battle, like others, can be seen as a type of spiritual warfare, prefiguring the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.

After victories at Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, Eglon, and Hebron (<a href="/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28-37</a>), &#8220;finally&#8221; shows God&#8217;s plan progressing to its intended completion.<p>- Israel&#8217;s momentum is not random but directed. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a> foretold, &#8220;When the LORD your God delivers them over to you and you defeat them, you must utterly destroy them.&#8221;. Joshua&#8217;s campaign is the fulfillment of that earlier charge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joshua</b><p>- Joshua&#8217;s steady obedience keeps pointing back to the charge in <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>, &#8220;Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe all the law My servant Moses commanded you.&#8221;. Each step&#8212;now including Debir&#8212;shows a leader walking out that command.<p>- His leadership mirrors Moses&#8217; earlier battlefield posture (<a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-13</a>), reminding Israel that victory rests in God-appointed authority under God&#8217;s power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all Israel with him</b><p>- The phrase stresses national unity. In <a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1-2</a> the LORD spoke to the entire fighting force, and they moved as one. That same oneness reappears here.<p>- Corporate obedience matters; every tribe shares both risk and reward. <a href="/judges/20-11.htm">Judges 20:11</a> later describes Israel when &#8220;all the men of Israel were gathered together as one man against the city.&#8221;. Debir echoes that solidarity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>turned toward Debir</b><p>- Debir (also called Kiriath-sepher, <a href="/joshua/15-15.htm">Joshua 15:15</a>) lay southwest of Hebron. Turning toward it means Israel methodically eliminates remaining strongholds rather than settling for partial victory.<p>- Their pivot fulfills God&#8217;s promise of territory (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) and keeps pace with His directive not to leave pockets of resistance (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-17</a>).<p>- Faith follows through. As <a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28-30</a> illustrates the cost of finishing a project, Joshua models finishing the conquest God began.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fought against it</b><p>- The verb is active and immediate. Spiritual courage translates into physical engagement. <a href="/joshua/10-39.htm">Joshua 10:39</a> records the result: &#8220;They captured it and its king and all its cities; they struck them with the sword and completely destroyed everyone in it.&#8221;.<p>- God&#8217;s partnership is central: &#8220;One of you can put a thousand to flight, because the LORD your God fights for you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a>). Their swords swing, but the victory is the LORD&#8217;s.<p>- For believers today the battle imagery becomes spiritual: &#8220;The weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world. Instead, they have divine power to demolish strongholds&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>).

The verse underscores perseverance, unity, and reliance on the LORD&#8217;s promise. Debir&#8217;s fall would shortly follow, but the meaning is already clear&#8212;when God directs, His people move, fight, and finish the task in His strength.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Debir</span> is not identified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua returned.</span> Rather, Joshua <span class="accented">turned.</span> Debir was not on the way <span class="accented">back</span> from Hebron to Eglon, but in a different direction. His march was now southward instead of eastward. <span class="cmt_word">Debir</span>. A city of importance, since only Hebron and it are mentioned in the history of the campaign as having cities dependent on them. It is also called Kirjath-Sepher (<a href="/joshua/15-15.htm">Joshua 15:15</a>; <a href="/judges/1-11.htm">Judges 1:11</a>), and Kirjath-Sannah (<a href="/joshua/15-49.htm">Joshua 15:49</a>). The first name signifies "the city of the hook," from whence it has been argued that it was the seat of what we should now call an university. Recent discoveries have rendered this supposition by no means improbable. The Hittite remains have proved that people to have been a more influential and intellectual people in early times than had ever been supposed until lately. Others have suggested that it was the abode of an oracle, which is rendered probable if Debir be connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> word. The meaning of Kirjath-Sannah is by no means clear. Some have derived it from the Arabic "sunna," <span class="accented">law</span>, or <span class="accented">doctrine</span> (whence the Sunnite sect among the Mohammedans), and some from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, a palm branch, or more probably a thornbush. Ritter thinks that both Kirjath-Sepher and Kirjath-Sannah imply the place where the public records were kept. Perhaps what is meant is that, like Mona or Anglesea to the Druids, Debir was the home of the Canaanitish religious traditions. Debir appears as Dapur in the list of fortified cities in Canaan captured by Seti I. and Rameses II. of Egypt. They are depicted on the monumental records. See Tomkins, 'Studies of the Time of Abraham,' p. 84. Debir has lately been identified by the Palestine Survey. Lieut. Conder ('Quarterly Paper,' Jan., 1875, p. 48) fixes it at El Dho-heriyeh or Dhaheriyeh. The identification depends upon the passages <a href="/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>, and <a href="/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>. See note on the former. The grounds of the identification are as follows: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Debir (see last note) was southward of Hebron. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The circumstances require an arid locality, but within a moderate distance two sets of springs, or pools of water. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> There must be signs of ancient dwellings, and, as Debir was a royal city, it must be the converging point of the various roads. All these conditions are fulfilled by El Dhaheriyeh. The rock excavations, the sign of the most ancient dwellings, are plentiful there; ancient roads are found converging in all directions. And six miles and a half north of the village fourteen springs, or pools, are found, some at the head of the valley, some lower down, and some at a lower level still. The distance of these from Debit is in exact accordance with the narrative. They are too far off to be included as a matter of course within the boundaries of Debit, and would naturally enough become the object of such a petition as Achsah is said to have preferred in the passage above cited. Wilson's 'Lands of the Bible,' 1:351, speaks of the excavations here, but does not appear to have been aware of their antiquity. He describes the inhabitants as living in them. But he remarks - and it is a singular confirmation of Lieut. Conder's subsequent discovery - that the sites of five out of the ten cities mentioned in conjunction with Debir in <a href="/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48-51</a>, are to be found in the immediate neighbourhood of Dhaheriyeh (ibid. p. 353). From this passage and some others, however, Knobel has anticipated Lieut. Conder's suggestion. He describes Thaharijeh, as he calls it, as on the high road from Gaza, with ruins of great antiquity, situated in the midst of a country which, though barren in appearance and destitute of trees and arable land, is yet rich in pasture. But he says nothing of the springs, the only thing wanting to make the evidence complete. Ritter's description of the place as the "first place of importance" on arriving in Palestine from the south, and as the meeting place of the roads from Beersheba, from Gaza and Egypt, and from Petra and Sinai, confirm Lieut. Conder's view, but Bitter does not seem to have identified it with Debir, though he regards it as "one of a series of fortresses designed to protect the southern frontier of Judaea" (3:193, 288). It became a Levitical city (<a href="/joshua/21-15.htm">Joshua 21:15</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-58.htm">1 Chronicles 6:58</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Finally Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1435;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
