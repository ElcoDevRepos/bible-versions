In the context of <a href="/joshua/22.htm">Joshua 22</a>, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar as a witness to their shared faith with the other tribes of Israel. This act was meant to prevent future disputes about their allegiance to the LORD. Biblically, the concept of a "witness" is significant, as seen in <a href="/genesis/31-44.htm">Genesis 31:44-48</a>, where Jacob and Laban set up a stone pillar as a witness to their covenant. The idea of a generational witness underscores the importance of passing down faith and traditions, as emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>.<p><b>that we will worship the LORD in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings.</b><br>Worship in the Old Testament often involved specific offerings, each with distinct purposes. Burnt offerings symbolized atonement and dedication to God (Leviticus 1), sacrifices were acts of worship and thanksgiving (Leviticus 3), and peace offerings represented fellowship with God. The phrase "in His presence" indicates the centrality of worshiping where God has chosen to dwell, which at that time was the tabernacle in Shiloh. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's presence among His people, a precursor to the New Testament revelation of God dwelling among us through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>Then in the future, your descendants cannot say to ours, &#8216;You have no share in the LORD!&#8217;</b><br>This phrase addresses the concern of future alienation or division among the tribes. The altar served as a physical reminder of their shared heritage and covenant with God. The fear of being told "You have no share in the LORD" reflects the deep desire for unity and inclusion within the covenant community. This concern for unity is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are reminded of their unity in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>). The altar as a witness is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator and unifier of God's people, ensuring that all who believe have a share in the promises of God (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eastern_tribes.htm">The Eastern Tribes (Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh)</a></b><br>These tribes settled on the east side of the Jordan River and built an altar as a witness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_witness.htm">The Altar of Witness</a></b><br>Constructed by the Eastern tribes as a symbol of unity and shared faith with the rest of Israel, not for sacrifices but as a testimony.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas,_son_of_eleazar_the_priest.htm">Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest</a></b><br>Sent by the Israelites to confront the Eastern tribes, ensuring their actions were not rebellious against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_canaan.htm">The Land of Canaan</a></b><br>The primary land of the Israelites, west of the Jordan River, where the rest of the tribes resided.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A geographical and symbolic boundary between the Eastern tribes and the rest of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_faith.htm">Unity in Faith</a></b><br>The altar served as a reminder of the unity among the tribes despite geographical separation.

in YHWH is to partake of covenant promises (<a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes this inheritance language: Gentiles are now &#8220;fellow heirs&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/22-27.htm">Joshua 22:27</a> records the eastern tribes&#8217; heartfelt desire to safeguard unity and covenant faithfulness. Their altar is not a rival shrine but a tangible witness, ensuring that every generation&#8212;east or west of the Jordan&#8212;remembers its rightful share in the LORD, worships Him according to His word, and remains one people under His everlasting covenant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Ye have no part in the Lord.</span>--Something of the kind was insinuated in the abuse of the Gileadites by the men of Ephraim (<a href="/judges/12-4.htm" title="Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.">Judges 12:4</a>), when they said, "Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites." That taunt cost the Ephraimites the lives of 42,000 men. The person who made it the law of Israel to have no part in Jehovah was "Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin" by setting up the calves, and thus diverting the stream of national worshippers from Jerusalem, the place chosen by the Lord. It may be further observed that Joshua's efforts under the direction of Jehovah for the establishment of national unity in Israel are proved by the narrative in this chapter to have taken considerable effect. At whatever cost, it was felt that the unity of national worship must be maintained. Rebellion "against Jehovah" is treated by the heads of Israel (<a href="/joshua/22-19.htm" title="Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass you over to the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.">Joshua 22:19</a>) as rebellion "against us."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But that it may be a witness.</span> Rather, for <span class="accented">this altar is a witness before Him.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">before His face</span>;
