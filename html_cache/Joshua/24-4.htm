Jacob and Esau, the twin sons of Isaac, represent two nations (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). Jacob, later named Israel, is the father of the twelve tribes of Israel, while Esau is the ancestor of the Edomites. This choice underscores the theme of divine election, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10-13</a>, where Paul discusses God's purpose in election, emphasizing that it is not by works but by His calling.<p><b>I gave Esau Mount Seir to possess,</b><br>Mount Seir, located in the region south of the Dead Sea, was given to Esau and his descendants, the Edomites, as their inheritance (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>). This allocation of land is significant as it shows God's provision and fulfillment of His promises to Esau, despite Esau not being the chosen line for the covenant. The Edomites' relationship with Israel was often contentious, as seen in various biblical accounts, including Obadiah's prophecy against Edom.<p><b>but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the migration of Jacob and his family to Egypt during a severe famine, as detailed in <a href="/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a>. This move was orchestrated by God to preserve the family and fulfill His promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). The sojourn in Egypt sets the stage for the Exodus, a pivotal event in Israel's history, symbolizing redemption and foreshadowing Christ's redemptive work. Egypt, in biblical typology, often represents bondage and sin, from which God delivers His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch in the lineage of the Israelites.

Yet even in the womb God distinguished their futures (<a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10-13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming both brothers, Joshua highlights that every line of descent&#8212;chosen or not&#8212;rests on God&#8217;s gracious initiative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I gave Esau Mount Seir to possess&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Although Esau was not the carrier of the covenant, the Lord still provided him with an inheritance (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; This grants Israel a lesson in humility: God blesses according to His own purposes, not merely human merit.<p>&#8226; The land grant also explains why Israel was later forbidden to seize Edomite territory (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>), underscoring God&#8217;s sovereign boundaries (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

The descent to Egypt set the stage for the Exodus, where God&#8217;s power and covenant faithfulness would be displayed on a national scale (<a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1-14</a>; 3:6-10).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that the route to promise sometimes travels through hardship, yet God oversees every mile (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-17.htm">Psalm 105:17-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/24-4.htm">Joshua 24:4</a> showcases God&#8217;s sovereign distribution of blessings: He formed two nations in Isaac&#8217;s household, assigned Esau immediate territory, and led Jacob into temporary exile so that He might later redeem an entire people.
