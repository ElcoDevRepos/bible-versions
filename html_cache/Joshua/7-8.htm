As the leader of Israel, Joshua is in a position of responsibility and accountability before God. His cry to the Lord is a plea for understanding and guidance. This moment of vulnerability is reminiscent of other biblical leaders who sought God's wisdom in times of crisis, such as Moses in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>. It highlights the importance of seeking divine counsel when faced with overwhelming challenges.<p><b>now that Israel has turned its back</b><br>The phrase "turned its back" signifies a retreat or defeat, which was a significant event for Israel, a nation that had experienced miraculous victories under God's guidance. This turning away can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual failure or disobedience, as Israel had sinned by taking devoted things from Jericho (<a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>). Theologically, it underscores the consequences of sin and the need for repentance and restoration. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where turning back to God is associated with healing and forgiveness.<p><b>and run from its enemies?</b><br>The act of running from enemies was a reversal of the victories Israel had experienced, such as the fall of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>. This defeat at Ai was unexpected and demoralizing, serving as a reminder of the conditional nature of God's promises, which required obedience and faithfulness. Historically, the city of Ai was strategically important, and its conquest was crucial for Israel's continued success in the Promised Land. Theologically, this defeat illustrates the principle that victory is dependent on God's presence and favor, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, where obedience leads to triumph over enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.

The leader&#8217;s role is to seek God&#8217;s counsel rather than rely on military skill.<p>&#8211; It also underscores that Israel&#8217;s victories were never due to their might (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a>); therefore, defeat must spring from a spiritual breach, not a tactical flaw.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now that Israel has turned its back</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Turned its back&#8221; signifies shame and covenant judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>). God had pledged, &#8220;No man shall stand against you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>), yet the promise was conditional on obedience.<p>&#8211; The reversal at Ai reveals hidden sin&#8212;Achan&#8217;s theft from Jericho&#8212;that broke the ban (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1, 11</a>-12).<p>&#8211; Corporate responsibility is highlighted: one man&#8217;s disobedience brought national disgrace, just as later Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness would bring exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And run from its enemies?</b><p>&#8211; Flight before enemies was a sign of divine displeasure (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9-10</a>).<p>&#8211; Joshua fears not only further military losses but the impact on God&#8217;s reputation among the Canaanites (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-9.htm">Joshua 7:9</a>).<p>&#8211; The question sets up the solution: identify and purge the sin so that God&#8217;s protective presence returns (<a href="/joshua/7-13.htm">Joshua 7:13</a>). Victory will be restored once holiness is restored (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/7-8.htm">Joshua 7:8</a> captures the leader&#8217;s raw bewilderment after an unexpected defeat. Addressing God first, Joshua admits his inability to fix the situation, recognizes that the nation&#8217;s retreat exposes covenant failure, and worries about God&#8217;s honor before the watching world.
