Setting up camp there turns the enemy&#8217;s former stronghold into Israel&#8217;s base of operations, a graphic picture of God turning opposition into opportunity (<a href="/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28</a>). The camp provides rest, regrouping, and renewed vision for the next stage of conquest, reminding us that victory is meant to be stewarded, not merely celebrated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and no one dared to utter a word against the Israelites</b><p>Fear grips the surrounding nations. God had promised, &#8220;I will send My terror before you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>), and &#8220;This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples under the whole heaven&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>). Now that promise materializes: opposition falls silent. The silence is not merely political; it is spiritual, reflecting a reverence for the God who fights for His people (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a>). For believers today, it foreshadows the ultimate vindication when every tongue will acknowledge the Lord&#8217;s supremacy (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/10-21.htm">Joshua 10:21</a> records a snapshot of total victory: every soldier preserved, leadership honored, territory secured, and enemies silenced.

Most likely the pursuit lasted one or two days. After the return to Makkedah the execution of the kings was carried out with much ceremony (ver. 24), and their bodies hung up before all Israel, not so much as a memorial of the victory, as to impress upon the Israelites the duty of exterminating their enemies, a duty which the after history of the twelve tribes shows them to have been very prone to forget. <span class="cmt_word">None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">He did not sharpen against the children of Israel, against a man, his tongue.</span> The Hebrew construction here is somewhat unusual. Houbigant and Maurer suppose that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;</span>is a mistake of the copyist and that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> is the subject of the sentence. They would translate as the LXX., "no man muttered with his tongue against the children of Israel." But Keil and Rosenmuller prefer a rendering agreeing with that of the Authorised Version, <span class="accented">node moved</span> (or <span class="accented">sharpened</span>) <span class="accented">his tongue against the children of Israel, not against a single man of them.</span> And this is a far more forcible way of expressing the awe in which they were held.
