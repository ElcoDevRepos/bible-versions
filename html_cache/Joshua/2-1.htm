His name means "The LORD is salvation," which is significant as he leads the people into the Promised Land, a type of Christ leading believers into spiritual rest. Joshua is from the tribe of Ephraim and was one of the original twelve spies sent by Moses (<a href="/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8</a>).<p><b>secretly sent two spies from Shittim</b><br>Shittim, located east of the Jordan River, was the Israelites' last encampment before entering Canaan. The secrecy of the mission underscores the strategic and cautious approach Joshua took, learning from Moses' earlier experience with the twelve spies. This action reflects a blend of faith and prudence, as Joshua seeks to understand the land's challenges.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Go, inspect the land, especially Jericho.&#8221;</b><br>Jericho was a fortified city and a key strategic target in the conquest of Canaan. Its location was crucial as it controlled access to the central highlands. The focus on Jericho highlights its importance as the first major obstacle in the Israelites' path. The command to inspect the land shows Joshua's reliance on intelligence and preparation.<p><b>So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab</b><br>Rahab's house, likely an inn or tavern, was a place where travelers could stay, making it a strategic choice for the spies to gather information without arousing suspicion. Rahab's profession and her role in the narrative highlight God's grace and the inclusion of Gentiles in His plan. Rahab is later mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) and praised for her faith in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>.<p><b>and stayed there</b><br>The spies' stay at Rahab's house sets the stage for her pivotal role in aiding the Israelites. This act of staying signifies a divine appointment, as Rahab's faith and actions lead to her and her family's salvation.

Shittim was the last stage of the Exodus under Moses. Probably the sending of these two spies was simultaneous with the issue of the general orders to Israel to prepare for the passage of Jordan within three days. The three days of <a href="/joshua/1-11.htm" title="Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.">Joshua 1:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-22.htm" title="And they went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.">Joshua 2:22</a> appear to be the same period of time.<p><span class= "bld">Two men to spy.</span>--The sending of these spies should be compared, as to the general effect and character of the measure, with other similar events. There are three instances of sending spies in reference to Canaan--viz., (1) the sending of the twelve by Moses from Kadesh-barnea; (2) the instance before us; (3) the sending of men to view Ai. The present instance is the only one in which the measure had a good effect. In the case of the twelve, Moses describes the action as a manifestation of unbelief. The spies took upon them to discover the right path for Israel to take, a thing which was God's prerogative, not theirs (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-22.htm" title="And you came near to me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.">Deuteronomy 1:22</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/1-32.htm" title="Yet in this thing you did not believe the LORD your God,">Deuteronomy 1:32-33</a>). The men who viewed Ai (<a href="/context/joshua/7-2.htm" title="And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.">Joshua 7:2-3</a>) came back and presumed to instruct Joshua how to proceed against it, with disastrous results. In this instance the two men brought back a report of the state of things in Jericho (exactly what they were ordered to do), which encouraged all Israel to proceed. Compare the effect of Gideon and Phurah's visit to the camp of Midian (<a href="/judges/7-11.htm" title="And you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.">Judges 7:11</a>), "Thou shalt hear what they say, and. afterwards shall thine hands be strengthened." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> -  <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua the son of Nun sent.</span> Rather, as margin, had sent (see note on Joshua 1:2). It might have been at the very time when the command was given to the Israelites, for, according to a common Hebrew manner of speech (see, for instance, <a href="/1_samuel/16-10.htm">1 Samuel 16:10</a>), the three days (ver. 22) may include the whole time spent by the spies in their exploring expedition.

It was "the long belt of acacia groves which mark with a line of verdure the upper terraces of the valley." (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 298). The word Abel, or meadow, signifying the long grass with its juicy moisture, points to it as a refreshing place of sojourn and pasture for flocks, after the weary wandering in the wilderness. The acacia, not the <span class="accented">spina AEgyptiaca</span> of the ancients, the <span class="accented">mimosa Nilotica</span> of Linnaeus, but the acacia Seyal, a tree with a golden tuft of blossom, which is still (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 524) to be found on the spot, very hard dark wood, of which much use was made in the tabernacle and its fittings (see <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 26, 36, 37</a>, etc.). The name Abel was a common one in Palestine, and is the same as Abila, from whence comes Abilene (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>). We may add that it has nowhere been said that they <span class="accented">were</span> at Shittim. We find this out from <a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>. This undesigned coincidence is beyond the power of an inventor, and far beyond the power of a compiler who was not only untrustworthy, but so clumsy that he made the most extraordinary blunders in the management of his matter (see note on next verse, and also on Joshua 1:11). <span class="cmt_word">Two men.</span> <span class="accented">Young men</span>, as we are told in <a href="/joshua/6-23.htm">Joshua 6:23</a>, and therefore active, fleet of foot as well as brave and prudent. All these qualities, as the subsequent narrative shows, were urgently required. "Joshua himself was full of God's Spirit, and had the oracle of God ready for his direction. Yet now he goes, not to the Propitiatorie for consultation, but to the spyes. Except where ordinarie meanes faile us, it is no use appealing to the immediate helpe of God; we may not seek to the posterne, but where the common gate is shut. It was promised Joshua that bee should leade Israel into the promised land, yet hee knew it was unsafe to presume. The condition of his provident care was included in that assurance of successe. Heaven is promised to us, but not to our carelessnesse, infidelitie, disobedience" (Bishop Hall). <span class="cmt_word">Secretly</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">dumbness</span> or <span class="accented">craftiness</span> (the noun being used adverbially), implying the silence and skill required for the task. He who knows how to he silent possesses one at least of the elements of success. The necessity of silence and secrecy may be inferred from <a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>. Keil, however, following the Masoretic punctuation, regards" secretly" as referring to the Israelites, and the spies as sent unknown to the army, that no depressing report might damp their courage. Jericho. "The city of fragrance" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> to breathe, and in the Hiphil, to smell a sweet odour), so called from its situation in the midst of palm trees, from which it was called "the city of palm trees <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> in <a href="/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/28-15.htm">2 Chronicles 28:15</a>; cf. <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. The vast palm grove, of which relics are even now occasionally washed up from the Red Sea, preserved by the salt in its acrid waters, has now disappeared. We read of it as still existing in the twelfth century, and indeed traces of it were to be seen as late as 1838. A dirty and poverty-stricken village called Riha, or Eriha, is all that now marks the site of all these glories of nature and art, and the most careful researches have until lately failed to discover any remains of the ancient city. It is doubtful whether the ruins observed by Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 216) are not the ruins of soma later city, built in the neighbourhood. Bartlett, p. 452, believes Riha to be the site of the later Jericho of our Lord's day, but Tristram would, with less probability, identify Riha with Gilgal. They both, however, place the site of ancient Jericho about a mile and a half from Riha. Conder thinks its true position is at the fountain Ain-es-Sultan. Lenormant, in his 'Manual of Oriental History,' remarks on the skill of Joshua as a military tactician. Whether he followed the advice of his experienced leader, or whether we are to attribute his success to special guidance from above, he certainly displayed the qualities of a consummate general. "Jericho," says Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 805), "stands at the entrance of the main passes from the valley of the Jordan into the interior of Palestine, the one branching off to the southwest towards Olivet, the other to the northwest towards Michmash, which commands the approach to Ai and Bethel. It was thus the key of Palestine to any invader from this quarter." He illustrates by <span class="accented">Chiavenna</span> (or the key city, from its situation), in Italy. Lenormant remarks that from an ordinary historical point of view the strategy of Joshua is worth notice. It was the practice ever followed by Napoleon, and, he adds, by Nelson also, to divide his enemies, and crush them in detail. Had Joshua advanced upon Palestine from the south, each success, as it alarmed, would have also united the various communities of the land, under their separate kings, by the sense of a common danger. Thus each onward step would have increased his difficulties, and exposed him, exhausted by continued efforts, to the assaults of fresh and also more numerous enemies, in a country which grew ever more easy to defend and more perilous to attack. But by crossing the Jordan and marching at once upon Jericho, he was enabled, after the capture of that city, to fall with his whole force first upon the cities of the south, and then on those of the north. The political condition of Palestine at that time (see Introduction) did not permit of a resistance by the whole force of the country under a single leader. A hasty confederation of the kings of the south, after the treaty with Gibeon, was overthrown by the rapid advance of Joshua and the battle of Beth-boron. By this success he was free to march with his whole army northward, against the confederation of tribes under the leadership of the king of Hazor, whom he overcame in the decisive battle of Merom. There is no hint given in the Scripture that in this strategy Joshua acted under the special guidance of the Most High. The probability is, that in this, as in all other of God's purposes effected through the agency of man, there is a mixture of the Divine and human elements, and that man's individuality is selected and guided as an instrument of God's purpose, which, in this instance, was the chastisement of the Canaanitish people, and the gift of the Holy Land as a possession to the descendants of Abraham. That Joshua was not indifferent to human means is shown by this very verse. <span class="cmt_word">Into a harlots house.</span> Many commentators have striven to show that this word simply means an innkeeper, an office which, as Dr. Adam Clarke proves at length, was often filled by a woman. It has been derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> to nourish, a root also found in the Syriac. The Chaldee paraphast and many Jewish and Christian interpreters have adopted this interpretation, in order, as Rosenmuller remarks, "to absolve her from whom Christ had His origin from the crime of prostitution." But St. Matthew seems to imply the very opposite. The genealogy there contained mentions, as though of set purpose, all the blots on the lineage of Christ as was fitting in setting forth the origin of Him who came to forgive sin. Only three women are there mentioned: Tamar, who was guilty of incest; Rahab, the harlot; and Ruth, the Moabitess. And the LXX. render by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. Calvin calls the interpretation "innkeeper" a "presumptuous wresting of Scripture." Hengstenberg ('Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 197) also rejects the interpretation "innkeeper," and maintains the right of the spies, who, he says, were no doubt chosen by Joshua for their good character, to enter a wicked woman's house for a good purpose. It does not appear that the spies entered the house of Rahab with any evil intent, but simply because to enter the house of a woman of that kind - and women of that kind must have been very numerous in the licentious Phoenician cities - would have attracted far less attention than if they had entered any other. Even there it did not escape the notice of the king, who had been thoroughly alarmed (ver. 3) by the successes of Israel eastward of Jordan. Origen, in his third homily on Joshua, remarks that, "As the first Jesus sent his spies before him and they were received into the harlot's house, so the second Jesus sent His forerunners, whom the publicans and harlots gladly received." <span class="cmt_word">Named Rahab.</span> Origen (Hom. 3) sees in this name, which signifies <span class="accented">room</span> (see Rehoboth, <a href="/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>), the type of the Church of Christ which extends throughout the world, and receives sinners. <span class="cmt_word">And lodged there.</span> Literally, and <span class="accented">lay</span> there, perhaps with the idea of lying hid, for they did not (ver. 15) spend the night there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(bin-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Nun</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1440;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#363;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5126.htm">Strong's 5126: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nun -- father of Joshua</span><br /><br /><span class="word">secretly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;re&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2791.htm">Strong's 2791: </a> </span><span class="str2">Magical craft, silence</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
