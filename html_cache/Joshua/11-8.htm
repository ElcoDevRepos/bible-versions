It reflects the recurring biblical theme that victory comes from the Lord, not merely through human strength or strategy. This aligns with earlier promises made to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>) and echoes the assurance given to the Israelites throughout their conquest of Canaan. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to divine assistance.<p><b>who struck them down and pursued them</b><br>The Israelites, under Joshua's leadership, acted decisively in battle. This reflects the fulfillment of God's command to take possession of the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>). The phrase indicates both the military prowess of Israel and their commitment to God's instructions. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of following through on God's commands without hesitation.<p><b>all the way to Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim</b><br>Greater Sidon was a significant Phoenician city, indicating the extent of Israel's campaign. Misrephoth-maim, possibly meaning "burning waters," is less clearly identified but suggests a location of strategic importance. The mention of these places highlights the thoroughness of Israel's conquest and the geographical breadth of their campaign. It also reflects the historical context of the ancient Near East, where control of key locations was crucial for dominance.<p><b>and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh</b><br>The Valley of Mizpeh, likely located in the northern region of Canaan, further illustrates the comprehensive nature of the military campaign. Mizpeh, meaning "watchtower," suggests a place of strategic observation and defense. This phrase indicates the extent of Israel's pursuit and the thoroughness with which they executed God's command to subdue the land.<p><b>They struck them down, leaving no survivors</b><br>This phrase reflects the complete and total victory achieved by Israel, in accordance with the divine mandate to eliminate the Canaanite presence (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>). It underscores the seriousness of God's command and the necessity of purging the land of influences that could lead Israel astray.

The issue of every battle is in God's hands. The natural man attributes it to human skill. The spiritual man, whether under the law or under the gospel, acknowledges the truth that "there is no restraint to the Lord, to save by many or by few" (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>). But if victory should ever side with numbers, if God appears not to "defend the right," it is that anxiety and sorrow may chasten the hearts of its upholders, lead them to "crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts," and so conduct them to a final victory when they are fitted to resist the intoxication of prosperity. Many a lesson in history has taught us that immediate success is by no means a blessing, even to those who are in the main fighting for a good cause. <span class="cmt_word">Great Zidon.</span> So called, not to distinguish it from any other city, but to mark (so also <a href="/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>) its importance as the capital of Phoenicia. This expression, "great Zidon," marks the early date of the Book of Joshua. In Homer's Iliad, Sidon is represented as the great home of the arts, though the historian Justin tells us that, even when Homer wrote, her superiority had passed to Tyre (see II. 6:290, 23. 743; Odyssey 4:618, 13:285, 15:425. Homer speaks of it as "well peopled," famous for "much brass" and the like (see Kenrick's 'Phoenicia'). In later years, Tyre, known only to the Book of Joshua as "the strong (literally, 'fortified') city." Tyre (<a href="/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>) outstripped her rival, and from the time of David till that of Alexander the Great, in spite of her destruction by Nebuchadnezzar, retained her pre-eminence (see the vivid description of Tyre in <a href="/ezekiel/26.htm">Ezekiel 26, 27</a>.). Sidon, now called Saida, is still a commercial city of some importance, whereas Tyre is, or was, a few years ago, little better than a collection of huts. This is not difficult to explain. The pre-eminence of Tyre was due to her military strength in a time of warlike enterprise, that of Sidon to natural, position. "This ancient city of Phoenicia, 'the eldest born of Canaan'" (see <a href="/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>), "stood on the northwest slope of a small promontory which runs into the sea, and its original harbour was formed by three low ridges of rocks, with narrow openings between them parallel to the shore in front of the city. On these islands there are remains of massive substructions, the work of the ancient Phoenicians. There is a spacious but unprotected bay on the south of the promontory .... No traces of the ancient city can be seen on the mainland, but at a short distance to the north are sepulchral grottoes, which probably mark the necropolis." The plain of Sidon is prolonged as far as Sarepta, the Zarephath of the Old Testament, eight miles to the south, which stands on a rising ground near the sea, and shows the remains of ancient walls (Kenrick, 'Phoenicia,' pp. 17, 18). <span class="cmt_word">Misrephoth Maim.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">burnings of waters. Kimchi</span> conjectures that these were hot springs, whereas <span class="accented">Jarchi</span> more reasonably supposes them to have been salt pits, in which the water was evaporated and the salt left. <span class="accented">Masius</span>, whom most modern commentators follow, thinks that glass houses, of which there were several near Sidon ("constat enim eas apud Sidonem fuisse plurimas"), are meant. But it is difficult to translate the Hebrew with him and Gesenins, "burning <span class="accented">near</span> waters," and the idea of some that water stands here for glass is absurd. Knobel regards it as equivalent to water-heights, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, cliffs rising from the sea, and derives the word from an Arabic root, <span class="accented">saraph, to be</span> high. The LXX. renders it by a proper name. Symmachus, "from the sea," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>. The Chaldee has "fossas aquarum." Misrephoth Maim (see <a href="/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>) was not far from Sidon. <span class="cmt_word">Valley</span>. The word here, Bik'a, signifies an open, wide valley between mountains (see ver. 17). Sometimes, as in <a href="/genesis/11-2.htm">Genesis 11:2</a>, it is equivalent to <span class="accented">plain.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/11-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">delivered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#601;&#183;n&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
