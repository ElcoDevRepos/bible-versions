This act of unfaithfulness highlights the seriousness of violating God's commands, especially concerning items devoted to Him. Achan's lineage, being a descendant of Zerah, connects him to the tribe of Judah, emphasizing that even those from prominent tribes were not exempt from judgment. The term "set apart for destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," where certain things were devoted to God, often through destruction, to purify the community and maintain holiness.<p><b>bringing wrath upon the whole congregation of Israel</b><br>Achan's sin had communal consequences, illustrating the interconnectedness of the Israelite community. This reflects the biblical principle that sin can affect not just the individual but the entire community. The wrath of God manifested in Israel's initial defeat at Ai, showing that disobedience could hinder the nation's progress and success. This communal aspect of sin is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, where Paul warns that a little leaven leavens the whole lump, indicating how sin can spread and impact the larger body.<p><b>Yet it was not only Achan who perished because of his sin!</b><br>The consequences of Achan's sin extended beyond himself, leading to the death of his family and the loss of Israelite soldiers at Ai. This serves as a sobering reminder of the far-reaching effects of sin. The communal punishment underscores the seriousness with which God views covenant faithfulness and the need for collective responsibility. This principle is seen throughout scripture, where the actions of one can bring consequences upon many, as in the case of Adam's sin affecting all humanity (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The narrative also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of many, reversing the curse of sin and death for those who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/achan.htm">Achan</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Judah who sinned by taking forbidden items during the conquest of Jericho, leading to Israel's defeat at Ai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zerah.htm">Zerah</a></b><br>Achan's father, mentioned to trace Achan's lineage within the tribe of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, which suffered consequences due to Achan's sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>The city whose spoils were devoted to destruction, from which Achan took forbidden items.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ai.htm">Ai</a></b><br>The city where Israel faced defeat due to Achan's sin, highlighting the communal impact of individual disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Achan's account illustrates that sin is not just a personal matter but can have communal consequences.

The case of Achan is even more in point than that of Peer. In his case the Israelites had a clear proof that "one man's sin," unless completely and absolutely put away, brought God's dis. pleasure on "all the congregation" (<a href="/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>). The repulse at Ai, fresh as it must have been in the memory of all, was sufficient evidence of this.
