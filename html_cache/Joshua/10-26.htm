The act of striking down and killing these kings signifies the complete victory God granted to Israel over their enemies. This event fulfills God's promise to deliver the Canaanite kings into Israel's hands (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>). The execution of these kings also serves as a judgment against their idolatry and wickedness, aligning with the divine mandate given to Israel to conquer the land of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>).<p><b>and he hung their bodies on five trees</b><br>Hanging the bodies on trees was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures as a public display of victory and a warning to others. In the biblical context, it also symbolizes the curse of God upon those who are hanged (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>). This act demonstrates the complete defeat and humiliation of the enemy, emphasizing the power and justice of God working through Joshua. It also prefigures the crucifixion of Christ, who became a curse for us by being hung on a tree (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p><b>and left them there until evening</b><br>The bodies were left hanging until evening in accordance with the Mosaic Law, which required that a hanged body not remain on the tree overnight (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). This law was intended to prevent the defilement of the land, showing respect for God's creation even in judgment. The removal of the bodies by evening also reflects the Israelites' obedience to God's commandments, highlighting the importance of following divine instructions precisely.
