It symbolized God's presence and covenant with Israel. The priests, from the tribe of Levi, were responsible for carrying the Ark, emphasizing the holiness and reverence required in handling it. This act signifies God's leadership and guidance as Israel enters the Promised Land, reminiscent of the Ark's role in leading the Israelites through the wilderness.<p><b>stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River was a significant geographical barrier, and its crossing marked a pivotal moment in Israel's history. The priests standing firm symbolizes stability and faith in God's promise. The miraculous drying of the river parallels the parting of the Red Sea, reinforcing God's power and faithfulness. This event also prefigures baptism, representing a transition from the old life to a new life in God's promise.<p><b>while all Israel crossed over the dry ground</b><br>The entire nation crossing safely signifies unity and collective faith in God's provision. It highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land.

The ark represented His throne on earth (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>), so wherever it went, His presence went.<p>- God had already told Israel, &#8220;When you see the ark &#8230; you are to move out from your positions and follow it&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3&#8211;4</a>). Obedience to that directive is unfolding here.<p>- Only the priestly tribe of Levi was authorized to bear the ark (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>). Their consecration showed that access to God&#8217;s power is inseparable from holiness.<p>- Practical takeaway: when God calls us to step forward, He supplies the leaders, the means, and the presence necessary for the task (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan</b><p>- &#8220;Stood firm&#8221; highlights stability in a place that moments earlier was impassable. Like the Red Sea miracle (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21&#8211;22</a>), the Jordan&#8217;s waters &#8220;stood still, piling up in a heap&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a>).<p>- The ground was &#8220;dry,&#8221; not muddy; God removes every barrier completely (<a href="/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3</a>).<p>- The priests stopped &#8220;in the middle,&#8221; forming a living bridge and underscoring that the center of Israel&#8217;s new life in the land would always be God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/joshua/4-10.htm">Joshua 4:10</a>).<p>- For us, the call is to trust God&#8217;s power to make solid ground where there seems to be none (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while all Israel crossed over the dry ground</b><p>- The miracle wasn&#8217;t limited to leaders; &#8220;all Israel&#8221; participated (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s path was wide enough and long-lasting enough for everyone&#8212;young, old, strong, weak&#8212;to pass safely, echoing the inclusiveness of the Red Sea crossing (<a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29</a>) and foreshadowing &#8220;Whoever believes in Him shall not perish&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p>- <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a> promises, &#8220;When you pass through the waters, I will be with you&#8221;&#8212;a promise Israel was experiencing in real time.<p>- New Testament writers looked back on such crossings as pictures of salvation and baptism (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until the entire nation had crossed the Jordan</b><p>- God&#8217;s provision did not lapse; the priests remained in place &#8220;until the entire nation had crossed.&#8221; No one was hurried, overlooked, or left behind (<a href="/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a>).<p>- The phrase assures us of God&#8217;s commitment to finish what He begins (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>- Moses had told them, &#8220;The LORD Himself goes before you &#8230; He will never leave you nor forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-8.htm">Deuteronomy 31:8</a>). That promise is being kept step by step.<p>- This completeness anticipates later declarations of God&#8217;s faithfulness, such as Solomon&#8217;s testimony, &#8220;Not one word has failed of all His good promise&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a> shows God&#8217;s people entering their promised inheritance under the visible leadership of His presence, carried by consecrated priests, over ground He alone made safe. The miracle was total&#8212;water held back, ground dried, and every Israelite brought through. It declares that when God leads, He provides a sure path, stays in the midst of the crisis until the last person is safe, and thus proves Himself utterly faithful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Firm</span>. The LXX. does not translate this. The Vulgate renders <span class="accented">accincti.</span> The original, literally translated, means <span class="accented">to cause to stand upright. <span class="cmt_word"></span>In the midst of Jordan.</span> That is, they stood surrounded by water, but not in midstream, which would be expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> as in ver. 10, where our version has "among" (see note on Joshua 4:9). So Drusius: "In medio Jordanis; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, intra Jordanem. Sic Tyrus legitur sita <span class="accented">in corde maris</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, intra mare nam non procul abest a continente." <span class="cmt_word">Clean over.</span> The word is the same as that translated "failed" in the last note. It means <span class="accented">completion</span> - "till the people had entirely finished crossing." Origen thus explains, in his fourth homily on Joshua, the mystical signification of this crossing the Jordan: "Cure catechumenorum aggregatus es numero, et praeceptis Ecclesiasticis parere coepisti digressus es mare rubrum, et in deserti stationibus positus, ad audiendam Dei legem, et intuendum Mosei vulture per gloriam Domini revelatum quotidie vacas.
