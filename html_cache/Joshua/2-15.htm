By aiding the Israelite spies, she aligns herself with God's people, risking her own safety. This act of letting the spies down by a rope signifies a pivotal moment of deliverance, reminiscent of other biblical rescues, such as Paul's escape in <a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>. The use of a rope and window suggests a clandestine operation, emphasizing the urgency and danger of the situation. Rahab's resourcefulness and quick thinking are highlighted here, as she uses available means to ensure the spies' escape.<p><b>since the house where she lived was built into the wall of the city</b><br>Jericho's walls were known for their formidable structure, often comprising two walls with houses built in between. Rahab's residence within the wall provided a strategic advantage for the spies' escape. Archaeological findings at Jericho have revealed evidence of such wall structures, supporting the biblical narrative. This location also symbolizes Rahab's position between two worlds: the pagan city of Jericho and the people of Israel. Her home in the wall represents her transitional state, moving from a life of idolatry to one of faith in the God of Israel. This setting foreshadows her eventual integration into the lineage of Jesus Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>, highlighting God's redemptive plan for all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho, known for her faith and actions in hiding the Israelite spies.

There is no reason to suppose the window by which she let them down. to have been so distant from the ground as to preclude a conversation, and it is quite possible that Rahab's house may have been in a situation in which such a conversation could be carried on without interruption. There are continental cities now surrounded by walls, in which such a conversation would involve no difficulty whatever, especially if the house from which such a conversation was carried on happened to stand a little apart from other houses. And though the spies sent by Moses described the walls of the Phoenician cities in hyperbolical language, it is highly improbable that their fortifications were stronger than those of mediaeval times. The little town of Ahrweiler, in the valley of the Ahr, near Remagen, may serve as an instance in point. It would once have been called a strongly fortified town, but the walls are of no great height, and the houses are built upon them. The same may be seen at Bacharach and Oberwesel, and other well known places where the fortifications have not been modernised. With the escape of the spies we may compare the escape of St. Paul from Damascus, as recorded in <a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>, and <a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32, 33</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [Rahab] let them down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1491;&#1461;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;w&#183;ri&#183;&#7695;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
