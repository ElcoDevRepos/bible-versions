This practice is rooted in the cultural and legal traditions of the time, where family honor and justice were paramount. The concept of the avenger of blood is also seen in <a href="/numbers/35-19.htm">Numbers 35:19</a>, which outlines the role and responsibilities of this individual. The pursuit indicates a legal and familial obligation to seek justice, reflecting the societal norms of retribution.<p><b>they must not surrender the manslayer into his hand</b><br>The cities of refuge were established to provide protection for those who had killed someone unintentionally. This command underscores the importance of due process and the protection of the innocent, even in a society where blood vengeance was common. The refusal to surrender the manslayer emphasizes the sanctity of life and the need for a fair trial, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-4.htm">Deuteronomy 19:4-6</a>. It reflects God's justice and mercy, ensuring that rash vengeance does not prevail over truth.<p><b>because that man killed his neighbor accidentally</b><br>This phrase highlights the distinction between accidental and premeditated killing. The Hebrew law made a clear differentiation between murder and manslaughter, as seen in <a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12-14</a>. The accidental nature of the act is crucial in determining the manslayer's eligibility for refuge. This provision reflects the biblical principle that intent matters in the administration of justice, aligning with God's character as just and fair.<p><b>without prior malice</b><br>The absence of "prior malice" indicates that the act was not premeditated or driven by hatred. This aligns with the biblical principle that God judges the heart and intentions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>. The requirement for no prior malice ensures that only those truly deserving of protection receive it, maintaining the integrity of the justice system. This concept is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of the heart's intentions in <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manslayer.htm">Manslayer</a></b><br>An individual who has unintentionally killed another person.
