The city of Madon was part of a coalition of northern Canaanite kings who opposed Israel. This coalition was led by Jabin, king of Hazor, and included several other kings. The mention of "one" signifies the singular defeat of each king, emphasizing the completeness of Israel's victory. Madon's exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to have been in the northern region of Canaan. The defeat of Madon's king demonstrates God's promise to deliver the land into Israel's hands, fulfilling the covenant made with Abraham. This victory also prefigures the ultimate triumph of Christ over all spiritual adversaries.<p><b>the king of Hazor, one;</b><br>Hazor was a significant Canaanite city, often referred to as the "head of all those kingdoms" (<a href="/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). It was strategically located and heavily fortified, making it a formidable opponent. The king of Hazor, Jabin, led the northern coalition against Israel. The defeat of Hazor's king is particularly noteworthy because Hazor was a major center of power in Canaan. Archaeological excavations have uncovered evidence of Hazor's destruction, aligning with the biblical account. The fall of Hazor symbolizes the breaking of Canaanite power and the establishment of Israelite dominance in the land. This victory is a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over the forces of evil, as Hazor's defeat was a turning point in the conquest of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_madon.htm">King of Madon</a></b><br>A ruler defeated by Joshua during the conquest of Canaan.
