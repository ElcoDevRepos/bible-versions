The Gibeonites' statement acknowledges their submission and vulnerability. In the ancient Near Eastern context, being "in your hands" signifies complete surrender and reliance on the mercy of the other party. This reflects the broader biblical theme of submission to God's will, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to present themselves as living sacrifices.<p><b>Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.</b><br>The Gibeonites' plea for mercy is an appeal to Joshua's sense of justice and righteousness. In the cultural context of the time, treaties and covenants were binding, and breaking them was considered a grave offense. The Gibeonites' request echoes the biblical principle of seeking justice and righteousness, as emphasized in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of loving one's enemies and showing mercy, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>. The Gibeonites' appeal can be seen as a type of Christ's submission to the Father's will, as He prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, "Not my will, but yours be done" (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.
