Unlike the other tribes, they did not receive a specific portion of land as their inheritance. This was in accordance with God's instructions to Moses, emphasizing their unique role in the spiritual life of Israel. The Levites were responsible for the tabernacle and later the temple services, including sacrifices and teaching the law. This lack of land inheritance is also mentioned in <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>, where God explains that He is their portion and inheritance.<p><b>The LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance,</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual inheritance of the Levites, which is a profound theological concept. Instead of material wealth or land, their inheritance was a direct relationship with God and the privilege of serving Him. This reflects a deeper spiritual truth that God Himself is the ultimate reward and sustenance for His people. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that believers are a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), with God as their ultimate inheritance.<p><b>just as He had promised them.</b><br>This refers to the promises made by God regarding the Levites' role and inheritance, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>. God's faithfulness to His promises is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, underscoring His unchanging nature and reliability. The fulfillment of His promises to the Levites serves as a reminder of His covenant faithfulness to all of Israel and, by extension, to all believers. This assurance of God's promises is a cornerstone of faith, providing hope and trust in His divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_levi.htm">Tribe of Levi</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for religious duties and service to God.
