In biblical times, physical markers were often used to commemorate significant events. The stones from the Jordan River were to remind the Israelites of God's miraculous intervention in stopping the river's flow, allowing them to cross on dry ground. This act of remembrance is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of recalling God's faithfulness and mighty works (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>).<p><b>In the future, when your children ask,</b><br>This anticipates future generations inquiring about the significance of the stones. It underscores the importance of oral tradition and storytelling in Hebrew culture, where history and faith were passed down through generations. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, where parents are instructed to teach their children about God's laws and deeds (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4-6</a>).<p><b>&#8216;What do these stones mean to you?&#8217;</b><br>The question highlights the personal and communal significance of the stones. It invites reflection on God's actions and encourages a personal connection to the collective memory of the community. This inquiry is not just about historical facts but about understanding and internalizing the spiritual lessons behind the event. The stones serve as a tangible reminder of God's covenant and faithfulness, similar to other memorials in Scripture, such as the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26-27</a>) and the Lord's Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The body of water that the Israelites miraculously crossed on dry ground.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve_stones.htm">The Twelve Stones</a></b><br>Stones taken from the Jordan River to serve as a memorial for future generations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>God instructs His people to create physical reminders of His faithfulness.

They proclaim, &#8220;The living God acts in real history, and His works are trustworthy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For believers today, baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper echo the same principle, openly declaring God&#8217;s saving acts in Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the future, when your children ask, &#8216;What do these stones mean to you?&#8217;</b><p>(<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6</a>b)<p>&#8226; God anticipates generational curiosity.

The passover, the law itself, as well as certain outward and visible memorials, were to be the guarantees to future ages of the truth of the history related in the Books of Hoses and Joshua. The monument has disappeared, but the observance of the passover and the whole law by the Jews now, more than 3,000 years after the events related in these books, is a perpetual standing witness of the truth of the record. In like manner the Christian passover, the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, is appealed to by Christians of every denomination as a proof of the substantial truth of the narrative of the Gospels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4616.htm">Strong's 4616: </a> </span><span class="str2">Purpose -- intent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">serve as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(tih&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a sign</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_226.htm">Strong's 226: </a> </span><span class="str2">A signal, as a, flag, beacon, monument, omen, prodigy, evidence</span><br /><br /><span class="word">among you.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;qir&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
