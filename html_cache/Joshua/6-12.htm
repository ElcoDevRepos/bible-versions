This practice of rising early is seen throughout Scripture as a sign of readiness and devotion (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>). It reflects a disciplined life, prioritizing God's mission over personal comfort. Joshua's leadership is marked by obedience and promptness, setting an example for the Israelites.<p><b>and the priests took the ark of the LORD</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant symbolizes God's presence among His people. Its central role in the conquest of Jericho underscores the necessity of divine guidance and power in achieving victory. The priests, as mediators between God and Israel, carry the Ark, highlighting the sacredness of their duty.
