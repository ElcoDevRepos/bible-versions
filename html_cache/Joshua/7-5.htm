The number thirty-six, though seemingly small, signifies a significant loss for Israel, especially after their previous victory at Jericho. This defeat underscores the consequences of disobedience to God, as Achan's sin had brought trouble upon the entire community. The number also serves as a reminder of the communal nature of sin and its impact on the whole group.<p><b>chasing them from the gate as far as the quarries</b><br>The gate of Ai represents the city's entrance, a strategic point in ancient warfare. The quarries, likely located outside the city, suggest a place where stone was extracted, possibly for building purposes. This detail indicates the extent of the Israelites' retreat and the thoroughness of their defeat. The chase from the gate to the quarries symbolizes a complete rout, emphasizing the Israelites' vulnerability without God's favor.<p><b>and striking them down on the slopes</b><br>The slopes refer to the hilly terrain surrounding Ai, which would have been difficult to navigate during a retreat. This geographical detail highlights the tactical disadvantage faced by the Israelites. The mention of the slopes also connects to the broader biblical theme of God using the natural landscape to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other battles where terrain played a crucial role.<p><b>So the hearts of the people melted and became like water</b><br>This phrase describes the psychological impact of the defeat on the Israelites. The imagery of hearts melting and becoming like water conveys a sense of fear, despair, and loss of courage. This reaction is reminiscent of the Canaanites' fear upon hearing of Israel's earlier victories, as described in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>.

So the Syriac and Chaldee versions. But this is quite out of the question. The Israelites were not annihilated, for they only lost about 36 men. Nor is Shebarim a proper name, as the Vulgate renders it. It has the article, and must be rendered either with Keil, the stone quarries (literally, <span class="accented">the crushings</span> or <span class="accented">breakings</span>), or with Gesenius, <span class="accented">the ruins</span>, which, however, is less probable, since Ai (see above)has a similar signification. Munsterus mentions a view that it was so called in consequence of the slaughter of the Israelites. But this is very improbable. <span class="cmt_word">In the going down.</span> Ai stood in a strong position on the mountains. The margin "in Morad "is therefore not to be preferred. It means, as the Israelites and their antagonists descended from the gates. <span class="cmt_word">The hearts of the people melted and became as water.</span> This was not cowardice, but awe. The people had relied upon the strong hand of the Lord, which had been so wonderfully stretched out for them. From Joshua downwards, every one felt that, for some unknown reason, that support had been withdrawn. <p> CHAPTER 7:6-15.
