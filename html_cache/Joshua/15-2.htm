The concept of borders is significant in the Bible, as it represents God's promise and the fulfillment of His covenant with Israel. The establishment of borders for the tribes of Israel is a fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Borders also signify order and the importance of respecting boundaries, both physically and spiritually.<p><b>started at the bay</b><br>The term "bay" here indicates a geographical feature, likely a small inlet or indentation along the coastline. This starting point is crucial for understanding the precise boundaries of Judah's inheritance. The use of specific geographical markers underscores the historical and factual nature of the biblical narrative, affirming the Bible's reliability in recording historical events.<p><b>on the southern tip of the Salt Sea</b><br>The Salt Sea, known today as the Dead Sea, is a significant landmark in biblical geography. It is the lowest point on earth and is known for its high salinity. The Dead Sea is often associated with the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-29</a>), serving as a reminder of God's justice. The southern tip of the Salt Sea marks the beginning of Judah's southern border, emphasizing the tribe's proximity to this historical site. This location also highlights the strategic and resource-rich nature of Judah's territory, which would play a role in the tribe's future prosperity and challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_judah.htm">The Tribe of Judah</a></b><br>This passage is part of the description of the territorial boundaries assigned to the tribe of Judah.

Although the points mentioned along the border are not all certainly known, there is no doubt that the great mountain wall which extends from the Dead Sea to the water-shed south of Rehoboth (<span class= "ital">Er-Ruheibeh</span>) formed the natural and recognised boundary of Palestine, while the river of Egypt (<a href="/joshua/15-4.htm" title="From there it passed toward Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.">Joshua 15:4</a>) is generally supposed to be the present <span class= "ital">Wady-el'-Arish, </span>the northern boundary between Syria and Egypt.

It is called the Lisan. Whoever was the writer of the Book of Joshua, these details prove him to have had an accurate acquaintance with the geography of Palestine. He was no priestly inventor of fables attached to the temple at Jerusalem. Canon Tristram gives a vivid description of the neighbourhood in his 'Land of Israel,' ch. 15. The ridge of Jebel Usdum - one large mass of rock salt - on the west of this "tongue" of water, the salt marsh of the Sebkha on the southwest, with its treeless waste - "not a plant or a leaf could be seen save just under the hills" - and its mirage like that of Sahara, the barren outline of the Lisan itself, to the eastward rising to an elevation of from five to six hundred feet, and the fertile oasis of the Ghor-es-Safieh at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, give an unique character to this remarkable region. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/15-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Their</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
