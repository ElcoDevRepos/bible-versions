It reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to the Israelites regarding their inheritance in the Promised Land. The command of the LORD is a recurring theme in the book of Joshua, highlighting obedience to God's will as crucial for success and blessing. This obedience is seen throughout the conquest narratives and is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>They gave him the city of Timnath-serah</b><br>Timnath-serah, later known as Timnath-heres, is located in the hill country of Ephraim. This city was given to Joshua as his inheritance, signifying his leadership and service to Israel. The allocation of this city to Joshua is significant as it underscores the principle of reward for faithful service. Timnath-serah's location in Ephraim, a central tribe of Israel, also highlights Joshua's connection to his own tribe and his role in unifying the nation.<p><b>in the hill country of Ephraim</b><br>The hill country of Ephraim is a region known for its rugged terrain and strategic importance. It was a central area in the land of Canaan and played a significant role in Israel's history. Ephraim was one of the leading tribes of Israel, and its territory included important cities such as Shiloh, where the tabernacle was located. The geographical setting of Timnath-serah in this region underscores its importance and the prominence of Joshua's inheritance.<p><b>as he requested</b><br>This phrase indicates that Joshua had a personal desire or preference for this particular city. It reflects his humility and contentment, as he did not seek a more prominent or fertile area but chose a place within his own tribal territory. Joshua's request and its fulfillment demonstrate the respect and honor he received from the Israelites for his leadership and faithfulness.<p><b>He rebuilt the city and settled in it</b><br>Rebuilding the city signifies restoration and establishment. Joshua's act of rebuilding Timnath-serah can be seen as a type of Christ, who rebuilds and restores the lives of believers. Settling in the city indicates a sense of permanence and fulfillment of God's promises. It also marks the end of Joshua's journey from slavery in Egypt, through the wilderness, to a settled life in the Promised Land, symbolizing the rest and inheritance that God provides to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua was the leader of the Israelites after Moses.

But the law of the inheritance was not to be set aside for him any more than for the meanest in Israel. Timnath-serah was in his own tribe. <span class="cmt_word">Timnath-serah.</span> Called Thamna by Josephus and the LXX., and Timnath-heres, or Tinmath <span class="accented">of the sun</span> by a transposition of the letters, in <a href="/judges/2-9.htm">Judges 2:9</a>. Rabbi Solomon Jarchi gives a singular reason for the latter name. It came to be so called because there was a representation of the sun upon the tomb of him who caused the sun to stand still. Timnath-serah must not be confounded with Timnah, or Timnathah, in the tribe of Dan (ver. 48). For a long time its site was unknown, but within the last 40 years it has been identified with Tibneh, seven hours north of Jerusalem, among the mountains of Ephraim. Dr. Eli Smith was the first to suggest this, and though it was doubted by Robinson, it has since been accepted by Vandevelde and other high authorities. Tibneh seems to have anciently been a considerable town. It is described in Ritter's 'Geography of Palestine' as a gentle hill, crowned with extensive ruins. Opposite these, on the slope of a much higher eminence, are excavations like what are called the Tombs of the Kings at Jerusalem. Jewish tradition, however, points to Kefr Haris, some distance south of Shechem, as the site of Joshua's tomb, and several able writers have advocated its claims in the papers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, on the ground that on such a point Jewish tradition was not likely to be mistaken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/19-50.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had commanded.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">They gave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him the city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
