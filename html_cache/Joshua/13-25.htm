It was initially conquered by the Israelites under Moses (<a href="/numbers/21-32.htm">Numbers 21:32</a>) and allotted to the tribe of Gad (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1-3</a>). The city was known for its fertile land, suitable for livestock, which was a primary reason the tribe of Gad desired it. Jazer's location made it a strategic point for trade and military defense. The city is mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8-9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a>, indicating its continued importance and eventual downfall.<p><b>all the cities of Gilead</b><br>Gilead was a region known for its balm, a valuable resin used for medicinal purposes (<a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>). It was a mountainous area east of the Jordan River, extending from the northern part of the Dead Sea to the Sea of Galilee. The cities of Gilead were part of the inheritance given to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. This region was often a battleground due to its strategic location and fertile land. Gilead is also associated with several biblical figures, including Jephthah (Judges 11) and Elijah the Tishbite (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>).<p><b>and half the land of the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>) and often in conflict with Israel. The land of the Ammonites was east of Gilead, and although Israel did not initially conquer Ammonite territory, they did gain control over some areas during the time of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). The reference to "half the land" suggests a partial occupation or influence over the region, possibly due to treaties or military campaigns. The Ammonites continued to be adversaries of Israel throughout the Old Testament (Judges 11, <a href="/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>).<p><b>as far as Aroer, near Rabbah</b><br>Aroer was a city located on the northern edge of the Arnon River, marking the southern boundary of the territory described. It was a significant landmark in defining the borders of the land given to the tribes east of the Jordan. Rabbah, also known as Rabbath-Ammon, was the capital city of the Ammonites, located near modern-day Amman, Jordan. This city was a major urban center and often mentioned in the context of military campaigns (<a href="/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>). The proximity of Aroer to Rabbah highlights the extent of Israelite influence and the ongoing tension with the Ammonites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jazer.htm">Jazer</a></b><br>A city located in the territory of Gilead, known for its fertile land and vineyards.
