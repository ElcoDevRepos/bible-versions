After 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, they are now in the Promised Land, Canaan, and are beginning to partake of its produce. This event signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to bring them to a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The timing is crucial, as it occurs right after the Passover (<a href="/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10-11</a>), symbolizing a new beginning and God's provision in a new form.<p><b>the manna ceased</b><br>The cessation of manna is a pivotal moment in Israel's history. Manna had been their sustenance throughout the wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>), a daily reminder of God's miraculous provision. Its end signifies a shift from miraculous provision to natural provision, as they are now in a land where they can cultivate and harvest. This transition also represents a call to maturity and responsibility, as they must now work the land.<p><b>There was no more manna for the Israelites</b><br>This statement underscores the finality of the transition. The Israelites must now rely on the resources of Canaan, which God had promised to their ancestors (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It also highlights God's faithfulness in providing for His people in different ways according to their needs and circumstances. The end of manna can be seen as a test of faith, as they must trust in God's continued provision through the land.<p><b>so that year they began to eat the crops of the land of Canaan</b><br>This marks the beginning of a new chapter in Israel's history. Eating the crops of Canaan signifies their settlement in the land and the start of agricultural life. It fulfills the promise made to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>). Theologically, it represents the transition from the wilderness experience to the establishment of a nation in the land God had given them. This event can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the true bread from heaven (<a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-35</a>), providing spiritual sustenance for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who have been wandering in the wilderness for 40 years and are now entering the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manna.htm">Manna</a></b><br>The miraculous food provided by God to the Israelites during their wilderness journey, symbolizing God's provision and care.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land, a land "flowing with milk and honey," representing the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_produce_of_the_land.htm">The Produce of the Land</a></b><br>The natural food resources of Canaan, which the Israelites began to consume, marking a new phase in their relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_transitions.htm">God's Provision Transitions</a></b><br>God's provision is constant, but the form it takes can change.
