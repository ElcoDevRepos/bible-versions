This event highlights the dangers of syncretism and the temptation to adopt pagan practices. The rhetorical question emphasizes the severity of the sin and serves as a warning against repeating past mistakes. It underscores the importance of faithfulness to God and the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day?</b><br>This phrase suggests that the effects of the sin of Peor lingered among the Israelites, indicating a lasting impact on the community. It reflects the idea that sin can have enduring consequences, both spiritually and communally. The notion of cleansing implies a need for repentance and purification, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This ongoing need for cleansing points to the insufficiency of human efforts and the ultimate need for divine intervention, foreshadowing the redemptive work of Christ.<p><b>It even brought a plague upon the congregation of the LORD.</b><br>The plague mentioned here is the one described in <a href="/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a>, where 24,000 Israelites died as a result of God's judgment. This serves as a stark reminder of the seriousness with which God views sin and the collective responsibility of the community. The term "congregation of the LORD" emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and His people, highlighting the expectation of holiness and obedience. The plague can be seen as a type of divine judgment that points to the ultimate judgment and the need for a savior, fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land and oversaw the division of the land among the tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peor.htm">Peor</a></b><br>A location where the Israelites sinned by engaging in idolatry and immorality with the Moabite women, leading to God's wrath and a devastating plague.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and given the Promised Land, yet struggled with faithfulness to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague.htm">The Plague</a></b><br>A divine punishment that fell upon the Israelites as a result of their sin at Peor, highlighting the seriousness of their transgression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transjordan_tribes.htm">The Transjordan Tribes</a></b><br>The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, who settled on the east side of the Jordan River and were involved in the events of <a href="/bsb/joshua/22.htm">Joshua 22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The sin at Peor serves as a stark reminder of how sin can have lasting consequences and affect the entire community.

Israel&#8217;s leaders connect the current situation&#8212;an altar whose purpose they do not yet understand&#8212;with the old sin that brought disaster, warning that God&#8217;s standards have not changed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day</b><p>- Though the plague ended, the consequences lingered:<p>&#8226; Twenty-four thousand graves (<a href="/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; A perpetual lesson embedded in Israel&#8217;s collective conscience (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-3.htm">Deuteronomy 4:3-4</a>).<p>- &#8220;Not cleansed&#8221; does not mean God withheld forgiveness; rather, the scar remained. Like the stones taken from the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>), the memory served as a standing testimony to future generations.<p>- The statement underscores communal accountability: even Israelites who did not personally bow to Baal still shared in the national guilt and its aftereffects. Paul draws on the same incident to warn the Corinthian church: &#8220;Now these things took place as examples for us&#8230; We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6-8</a>).<p>- By referencing an unremoved stain, the leaders appeal to holy fear: if the covenant community repeats such sin, the mark deepens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It even brought a plague upon the congregation of the LORD</b><p>- The phrase recalls the swift judgment that &#8220;the LORD said to Moses, &#8216;Take all the leaders&#8230; and execute them&#8230; that My fierce anger may turn away&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4-5, 9</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s response proved that idolatry is never an individual matter; it spreads like contagion, requiring decisive intervention (compare <a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-12</a> with Achan&#8217;s hidden sin).<p>- Phinehas, now leading this delegation, had once stopped the plague by his zeal (<a href="/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7-8</a>). His presence reinforces the warning: the same God who judged then will judge again if covenant boundaries are crossed.<p>- The western tribes fear collective punishment: &#8220;But if you rebel today, tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/22-18.htm">Joshua 22:18</a>). Remembered judgment motivates present obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/22-17.htm">Joshua 22:17</a> is a sober reminder that past transgressions carry ongoing lessons. The leaders invoke the sin of Peor to highlight how one compromise with idolatry invited national calamity and a divine plague. Although forgiven, Israel still bears the memory of that wound, compelling vigilance against any repeat. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s people must learn from history, guard the covenant, and recognize that individual choices can endanger the entire community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The iniquity of Peor.</span>--A very natural subject for reference on the part of Phinehas, who had distinguished himself by his zealous opposition to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is the iniquity of Peer too little for us?</span> How natural the illustration in the mouth of the speaker! It was Phinehas who had avenged the iniquity of Peer, and arrested the judgment for that offence as it was about to fall. How natural that the occurrence should be, as it were, branded upon his memory with a hot iron, and that the mention of it should spring at once to his lips when he saw his brethren, as he thought, upon the verge of a similar offence! Peor is, of course, a contraction for Baal-Peor (<a href="/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a>). This god derives his name probably from Mount Peer, or "the cloven mountain" (<a href="/numbers/23-28.htm">Numbers 23:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From which we are not cleansed until this day.</span> Here we have the expression of the feeling which was never removed until Christ came. It was not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats could take away sin. No ceremonial lustrations could "cleanse us from its guilt and power." No destruction of the prime mover of the offence, though it may avert the wrath of God, can remove the moral reproach which lies upon the sinner. Not even the destruction of twenty-four thousand persons (<a href="/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a>) can purify Israel from the taint of pollution. In the eyes of a sincere servant like Phinehas, the stigma rests upon Israel still, nor could anything avail to take it away. Truly, the law was, indeed, "our schoolmaster, to bring us to Christ." What Keil says of Calvin's explanation, that "the remembrance was not yet quite buried, nor the anger of God extinct," is unsatisfactory. His own explanation, that "the heart of Israel still delighted in their sin," is even more so, since we have no evidence whatever that this was the case at the time of which we are speaking. We have here again to remark that the history in Numbers is here presupposed, and an allusion to an incident in Numbers is here placed in the mouth of one of the chief actors in it. How natural, if the history be a veracious one! How marvellously ingenious, if it he not! The circumstance is mentioned again in Hosea, in the time of Jotham or Hezekiah, and again in <a href="/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a>, which would appear to have been written during the captivity. Thus we have a chain of testimony concerning it which makes it difficult to assign a time for the invention of the story, if it be invented, since all references to it in Scripture are perfectly consistent with each other, and display none of the signs of gradual growth which we invariably find in the case of legends. <span class="cmt_word">A plague.</span> The original is noticeable, the plague;
