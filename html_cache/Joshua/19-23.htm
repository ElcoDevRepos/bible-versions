The allocation of land to the tribes was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land of Canaan. Issachar's territory was located in the fertile Jezreel Valley, which was significant for agriculture. This inheritance reflects the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-14.htm">Genesis 49:14-15</a>, where Issachar is described as a strong donkey lying down between two burdens, indicating a prosperous but laborious life. The division of land among the clans underscores the importance of family and tribal identity in ancient Israel.<p><b>including these cities and their villages</b><br>The mention of cities and villages highlights the structured settlement patterns in ancient Israel. Cities were often fortified centers of administration and trade, while villages were smaller, agricultural communities. The specific cities and villages within Issachar's territory are listed earlier in <a href="/joshua/19-17.htm">Joshua 19:17-22</a>, including Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem. These locations are significant in biblical history; for example, Jezreel is associated with King Ahab and Queen Jezebel (1 Kings 21). The distribution of cities and villages also reflects the practical needs of the tribe, providing centers for worship, governance, and community life.

Situated in the midst of this fertile plain, accessible alike to Egypt by the way of the Shephelah, and to the east by way of the fords of the Jordan, the tribe of Issachar became in the end the prey of the various nationalities, who made the plain of Esdraelon their battlefield, and it was the first to "bow his shoulder to bear" and to "become a servant unto tribute" (<a href="/genesis/49-15.htm">Genesis 49:15</a>). It seems to have been to the east of Manasseh (see <a href="/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a>), and may have extended much further south than is usually supposed. Since but small mention of the Jordan is made in the boundary of Joseph, it may have extended as far or farther south than the Jabbok (see also note, <a href="/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a>). The general belief of explorers at present is that the inheritance of Issachar extended from Jezreel to the Jordan, and from the Sea of Tiberias southward as far as the border of Manasseh, above mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/19-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was the inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1435;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5159.htm">Strong's 5159: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something inherited, occupancy, an heirloom, an estate, patrimony, portion</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the clans</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4940.htm">Strong's 4940: </a> </span><span class="str2">A family, circle of relatives, a class, a species, sort, a tribe, people</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4294.htm">Strong's 4294: </a> </span><span class="str2">A staff, rod, shaft, branch, a tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Issachar,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1499;&#1464;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#183;&#7733;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3485.htm">Strong's 3485: </a> </span><span class="str2">Issachar -- perhaps 'there is recompense', a son of Jacob and Leah, also a son of Obed-edom</span><br /><br /><span class="word">including the cities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and their villages.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;a&#7779;&#183;r&#234;&#183;hen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2691.htm">Strong's 2691: </a> </span><span class="str2">A yard, a hamlet</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/19-23.htm">OT History: Joshua 19:23 This is the inheritance of the tribe (Josh.
