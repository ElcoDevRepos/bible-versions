The spoils refer to the items taken from the defeated city. In the context of ancient warfare, spoils were often considered the property of the victors, but in this case, God had commanded that all items from Jericho be devoted to Him (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-19</a>). This sets the stage for Achan's transgression, highlighting the importance of obedience to divine commands.<p><b>a beautiful cloak from Shinar</b><br>Shinar is an ancient region often associated with Babylon. The mention of a cloak from Shinar suggests a garment of significant value and exotic origin, indicating wealth and status. This reflects the allure of material possessions and the temptation they pose, a theme echoed in 1 <a href="/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>, which warns against the lust of the eyes.<p><b>two hundred shekels of silver</b><br>Silver was a common medium of exchange and a symbol of wealth in ancient times. The specific amount, two hundred shekels, represents a substantial sum, further emphasizing the temptation Achan faced. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of the corrupting power of wealth, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which states that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.<p><b>and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels</b><br>Gold, like silver, was highly valued and often associated with royalty and divinity. The weight of fifty shekels indicates a significant amount, adding to the gravity of Achan's sin. Gold's enduring value and allure are frequently mentioned in scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>, which contrasts the value of wisdom with that of gold.<p><b>I coveted them and took them</b><br>This confession reveals the progression of sin, beginning with covetousness, a violation of the Tenth Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>). The act of taking what was forbidden illustrates the destructive nature of unchecked desire, a theme that resonates throughout scripture, including in <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, which describes how desire leads to sin and ultimately death.<p><b>They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.</b><br>Achan's attempt to conceal his sin by hiding the items underscores the futility of trying to hide wrongdoing from God. This act of hiding reflects the human tendency to cover up sin, reminiscent of Adam and Eve's actions in <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8-10</a>. The specific mention of the silver being underneath may symbolize the foundational role of greed in Achan's sin. This concealment ultimately leads to Achan's downfall, illustrating the biblical principle that hidden sins will be brought to light, as stated in <a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/achan.htm">Achan</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Judah who disobeyed God's command by taking forbidden items from the spoils of Jericho, leading to Israel's defeat at Ai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shinar.htm">Shinar</a></b><br>A region in ancient Mesopotamia, often associated with wealth and idolatry, from where the coveted cloak originated.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>The city whose walls fell after Israel's obedience to God's command, marking a significant victory for Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ai.htm">Ai</a></b><br>The city where Israel faced defeat due to Achan's sin, highlighting the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who sought to rectify the situation by addressing the sin in the camp.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_covetousness.htm">The Danger of Covetousness</a></b><br>Coveting leads to sin and separation from God.

Achan&#8217;s private disobedience invited national defeat, proving that hidden sin never stays hidden before a holy God.

Literally, "a <span class="accented">mantle of Shinar, one goodly</span> one." Babylon was in the "land of Shinar" (see <a href="/genesis/11-2.htm">Genesis 11:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5e8;</span> great, glorious, was an ample cloak, sometimes of hair or fur (<a href="/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13, 19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13, 14</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>, etc.). The Babylonish mantle was famed for its beauty (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.), and was, no doubt, worked artistically with figures of men and animals. "Of all Asiatic nations, the Babylonians were the most noted for the weaving of cloth of divers colours. Into these stuffs gold threads were introduced into the woof of many hues. Amongst those who traded in 'blue clothes and embroidered work' with Tyro were the merchants of Asshur, or Assyria; and that the garments of Babylon were brought into Syria and greatly esteemed at a very early period, we learn from their being classed amongst the most precious articles of spoil, even with gold, in the time of Joshua" (Layard, 'Nineveh,' II. 413). From this, among other passages, we may infer the early date of the Book of Joshua. It marks an early stage of civilisation when an embroidered garment can be considered as in any degree equivalent to gold. The Israelites, it must be remembered, were not unaccustomed in Egypt to the highest degree of civilisation then known. "Nam Persarum, finitimarumque gentium luxum eo se ostentare solere vel ex eo constat quod captis ab Alexandro Magno Susis illicinventa fuerit 10 millia pondo, sive talents purpurae Hermionicae, teste Plutarcho in Alexandro" (Corn. a Lapide). <span class="cmt_word">A wedge of gold.</span> Literally, "a <span class="accented">tongue</span> of gold." Some derive our word ingot from the French <span class="accented">lingot</span>, or little tongue. But others derive it with greater probability from the Dutch <span class="accented">ingieten</span> the same as the German <span class="accented">einqiesen</span>, to pour in.
