The Ark represented God's presence among His people, and this separation emphasized reverence and respect. In the broader biblical context, the Ark contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna, symbolizing God's covenant, authority, and provision. The distance also ensured that the Ark was visible to all, guiding the Israelites as they prepared to cross the Jordan River. This act of keeping a distance can be seen as a type of Christ, who is both near to us and yet set apart in His holiness.<p><b>Do not go near it,</b><br>This command highlights the need for the Israelites to approach God with reverence and awe. The holiness of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, and the Israelites were reminded of the consequences of approaching God irreverently, as seen in the accounts of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) and Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>). The Ark, as the earthly throne of God, required the people to maintain a respectful distance, acknowledging God's transcendence and their own sinfulness.<p><b>so that you can see the way to go,</b><br>The Ark served as a guide for the Israelites, leading them into the Promised Land. This guidance is reminiscent of the pillar of cloud and fire that led them through the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). The Ark's position at the forefront allowed the people to follow its lead, symbolizing God's leadership and direction in their journey. This phrase also points to the necessity of divine guidance in unfamiliar circumstances, a principle applicable to believers seeking God's direction in their lives.<p><b>since you have never traveled this way before.&#8221;</b><br>The Israelites were entering uncharted territory, both geographically and spiritually. This journey into the Promised Land required faith and trust in God's promises. The phrase underscores the newness of the path and the need for reliance on God, who knows the way. It also foreshadows the new covenant and the new way of life that Jesus Christ would bring, as He is the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This journey into the unknown is a metaphor for the Christian walk, where believers are called to trust in God's guidance through life's uncertainties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are preparing to cross the Jordan River into Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The body of water the Israelites must cross to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_presence.htm">Reverence for God's Presence</a></b><br>The instruction to keep a distance from the Ark underscores the holiness of God and the need for reverence in His presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guidance_in_unfamiliar_paths.htm">Guidance in Unfamiliar Paths</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites had never traveled this way before, believers today can trust God to guide them through unknown and challenging circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' obedience to God's command to follow the Ark demonstrates the importance of faith and trust in God's leading.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The crossing of the Jordan is a testament to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, encouraging believers to trust in His promises today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_new_beginnings.htm">Preparation for New Beginnings</a></b><br>The Israelites' preparation to enter the Promised Land serves as a reminder of the importance of spiritual readiness for new phases in life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_3_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 3:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_stay_2000_cubits_from_the_Ark.htm">Why maintain a distance of "about two thousand cubits" from the Ark of Covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_3_4_God_s_guidance_in_unknowns.htm">How does Joshua 3:4 emphasize God's guidance in unfamiliar situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_faith_from_new_paths.htm">What does "you have not traveled this way before" teach about faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_follow_God_s_lead_daily.htm">How can we apply the concept of following God's lead in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_stress_God_s_guidance_2.htm">What other scriptures highlight the importance of following God's direction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_3_4_God_s_guidance_presence.htm">What does Joshua 3:4 reveal about God's guidance and presence among His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Joshua_3_4_show_God_s_holiness.htm">How does the command to keep distance in Joshua 3:4 reflect God's holiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_follow_the_Ark_in_Joshua_3_4.htm">Why was it important for the Israelites to follow the Ark in Joshua 3:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_ark_of_the_testimony.htm">What is the Ark of the Testimony?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/2_chr_3_4__how_was_the_porch_120_cubits.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4 -

Past manna-gathering in the wilderness had not prepared them for fortified Canaan, yet the LORD would lead the unfamiliar march (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30-33</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-16.htm">Isaiah 42:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today likewise meet uncharted seasons, trusting the same faithful Guide (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The ark going first foreshadows Christ, who has gone ahead to prepare our eternal place (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>) and to pioneer our salvation trail (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/3-4.htm">Joshua 3:4</a> teaches that God&#8217;s holy presence must be honored, approached on His terms, and kept in clear view so His people can follow. The commanded distance guarded Israel from presumption, showcased the LORD&#8217;s leadership, and readied the nation to step into unknown territory. In every new venture, fixing our eyes on the One who goes before us remains the surest way to walk paths we have never traveled.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall be a space between you and it.</span> Perhaps in order that they might keep it in view. This agrees best with the remainder of the verse, "that ye may know the way by which ye must go." Keil remarks that, had the Israelites pressed close on the heels of the priests who bore the ark, this would have defeated the very object with which the ark was carried before the people, namely, to point them out the way that they should go. But Cornelius Lapide among the earlier commentators and Knobel among the moderns hold that it was the sacredness of the ark which rendered it necessary that there should be a space of more than half a mile between it and the Israelites. Jarchi says the space was "in honour of God." We may learn hence that irreverent familiarity with sacred things is not the best way to obtain guidance in the way in which God would have us walk. "What awfull respects doth God require to be given unto the testimony of His presence? Uzzah paid deare for touching it; the men of Bethshemesh for looking into it. It is a dangerous thing to bee too bold with the ordinances of God" (Bp. Hall). "Neither was it onely for reverence that the arke must be wayted on afarre, but for convenience" (<span class="accented">Ibid.</span>). "The work of ministers is to hold forth the word of life, and to take care of the administration of those ordinances which are the tokens of God's presence and the instruments of His power and grace, and herein they must go before the people of God in their way to heaven" (Matthew Henry <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). (Cf. <a href="/numbers/4-19.htm">Numbers 4:19, 20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6, 7</a>; also <a href="/exodus/19-21.htm">Exodus 19:21</a>.) The original here is more emphatic than the translation. "Only there shall be a distance (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>) between you and it." <span class="cmt_word">Ye have not passed this way heretofore.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">ye have not crossed since yesterday, the third day.</span> Paulus would translate this "lately," and thus get rid of the miracle, regarding it as an intimation that they were crossing at one of the fords. But they had not crossed the Jordan <span class="accented">at all</span> before. Consequently the translation <span class="accented">lately</span> is inadmissible. And even if they had been crossing Jordan by one of the fords, there is, as we have seen, a wide difference between crossing at the ford in ordinary times and crossing it when Jordan had overflowed its banks. This is a fair sample of the criticism which seeks to explain away miracles, as well as finds discrepancies where there are none. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;
