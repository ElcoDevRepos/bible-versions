It follows the successful conquests of the northern and southern coalitions of Canaanite kings, suggesting a strategic continuation of Israel's efforts to secure the Promised Land.<p><b>Joshua proceeded to eliminate the Anakim</b><br>The Anakim were a race of giants, descendants of Anak, known for their formidable size and strength. Their presence in Canaan was a source of fear for the Israelites, as noted in the report of the spies in <a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>. Joshua's actions here fulfill God's promise to give Israel victory over their enemies, demonstrating God's power over seemingly insurmountable obstacles.<p><b>from the hill country of Hebron, Debir, and Anab</b><br>Hebron, Debir, and Anab were significant locations in the southern part of Canaan. Hebron, in particular, was an ancient city with historical and spiritual significance, being associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The elimination of the Anakim from these areas signifies the removal of a major threat and the establishment of Israelite control over key territories.<p><b>and from all the hill country of Judah and of Israel</b><br>This phrase expands the scope of Joshua's campaign to include the broader regions of Judah and Israel, indicating a comprehensive effort to secure the land. The hill country was strategically important for defense and agriculture, making its control vital for the stability and prosperity of the Israelite tribes.<p><b>Joshua devoted them to destruction, along with their cities</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," which involves the complete destruction of a people or city as an offering to God. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, intended to prevent the influence of pagan cultures and religions on the Israelites. It underscores the seriousness of maintaining the purity of worship and obedience to God's commands. This act also prefigures the ultimate victory over sin and evil through Jesus Christ, who conquers spiritual giants and secures eternal salvation for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land and conquering it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/anakim.htm">Anakim</a></b><br>A race of giants mentioned in the Bible, known for their formidable size and strength, descendants of Anak.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>A significant city in the hill country of Judah, historically important and later a city of refuge.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/debir.htm">Debir</a></b><br>Another city in the hill country, conquered by Joshua as part of the campaign against the Canaanites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/anab.htm">Anab</a></b><br>A lesser-known location in the hill country of Judah, also conquered by Joshua.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_fulfillment_of_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness in Fulfillment of Promises</a></b><br>God promised to give the land to Israel, and Joshua's conquest of the Anakim is a fulfillment of that promise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_giants_in_our_lives.htm">Overcoming Giants in Our Lives</a></b><br>Just as Joshua faced literal giants, we face metaphorical giants.

They were men of gigantic stature (<a href="/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32</a>), and were no doubt a hill tribe of the Amorites. It is worthy of remark that to the two fearless men whose faith did not fail them at the sight of the walled cities, and of the giant forms of their inhabitants, was entrusted the task of overcoming these antagonists, and thus of proving the truth of their own words. Thus it ever is in the counsels of God. "To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away." To Joshua, who had confidence in God, the whole land of Canaan was given into subjection.
