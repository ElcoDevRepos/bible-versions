This mission echoes the earlier spying mission in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, where Moses sent twelve spies into Canaan. Unlike the previous mission, which resulted in fear and rebellion, this mission is marked by faith and obedience. The spies' return signifies the completion of their task and the beginning of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan.<p><b>came down from the hill country</b><br>The hill country refers to the rugged terrain surrounding Jericho. This area was strategically significant, providing a natural defense and a vantage point for observing the land. The spies' descent from the hills symbolizes their transition from reconnaissance to reporting, a crucial step in the Israelites' military strategy.<p><b>and crossed the river</b><br>The river mentioned is the Jordan River, a significant geographical and spiritual boundary for the Israelites. Crossing the Jordan represents a transition from the wilderness wanderings to entering the Promised Land. This act prefigures the later miraculous crossing of the Jordan by the entire nation, as described in <a href="/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3</a>, symbolizing God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>So they came to Joshua son of Nun</b><br>Joshua, the leader of Israel, is a type of Christ, whose name in Hebrew, Yeshua, means "The Lord is salvation." His leadership is characterized by faithfulness and obedience to God. The spies' return to Joshua signifies their accountability and the importance of leadership in God's plan. Joshua's role as a military and spiritual leader foreshadows Christ's ultimate leadership and deliverance of His people.<p><b>and reported all that had happened to them</b><br>The spies' report is crucial for the Israelites' preparation to conquer Jericho. Their testimony includes Rahab's faith and assistance, highlighting God's providence and the inclusion of Gentiles in His redemptive plan. This report contrasts with the negative report of the earlier spies in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, demonstrating a shift from fear to faith.

God&#8217;s faithfulness motivates decisive action (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>).<p>- Like Abraham&#8217;s servants who &#8220;returned to Abraham&#8221; after their mission (<a href="/genesis/22-19.htm">Genesis 22:19</a>), these men illustrate obedience that begins and ends with returning to the one who sent them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came down from the hill country</b><p>- The rugged Judean hills had been a divinely timed refuge. Now, descending signifies transition from concealment to proclamation, much as Elijah left Horeb to speak for God (<a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15-18</a>).<p>- God often uses hidden seasons to refine courage before public testimony (<a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17-18</a>; <a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And crossed the river</b><p>- The Jordan stands between promise and possession. Though not yet parted for the nation (<a href="/bsb/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3</a>), these spies manage the crossing, previewing God&#8217;s impending miracle.<p>- Their safe passage echoes Israel&#8217;s earlier Red Sea deliverance (<a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29</a>) and foreshadows believers&#8217; assurance of victory even before the final act (<a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they came to Joshua son of Nun</b><p>- Returning to God-ordained leadership maintains unity. Compare Moses&#8217; twelve spies who bypassed communal accountability and spread fear (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31-33</a>).<p>- Joshua had been commissioned by the LORD (<a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1-2</a>); honoring that chain of command reflects submission to God-given authority (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And reported all that had happened to them</b><p>- Their report was filled with faith, not fear: &#8220;Truly the LORD has delivered all the land into our hands&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/2-24.htm">Joshua 2:24</a>).<p>- Good news strengthens the body; Rahab&#8217;s testimony plus their firsthand experience confirm God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-17.htm">Deuteronomy 7:17-19</a>).<p>- The pattern continues in <a href="/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>, where Paul and Barnabas &#8220;reported all that God had done,&#8221; igniting worship and readiness for the next step.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/2-23.htm">Joshua 2:23</a> captures the moment when covert obedience turns into courageous testimony. Protected by God in the hills, empowered to cross the Jordan, and accountable to Joshua, the spies relay a faith-filled report that readies Israel for conquest.
