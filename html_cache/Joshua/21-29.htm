It is mentioned in the context of the Levitical cities given to the descendants of Gershon. Historically, Jarmuth was one of the cities that joined the coalition against Joshua during the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>). This city is distinct from the Jarmuth in the territory of Judah. Archaeological evidence suggests that Jarmuth was a fortified city, indicative of its strategic importance in the region.<p><b>and En-gannim</b><br>En-gannim, meaning "spring of gardens," was another city given to the Levites. It was also located in the territory of Issachar. The name suggests a fertile area, likely with abundant water sources, which would have been crucial for agriculture and sustaining life. En-gannim is identified with the modern-day Jenin, a city in the northern West Bank. The presence of a spring would have made it a valuable location for settlement and agriculture.<p><b>&#8212;four cities, together with their pasturelands.</b><br>The mention of "four cities" refers to the total number of Levitical cities allocated in this passage, including Jarmuth and En-gannim. The inclusion of "pasturelands" highlights the provision for the Levites, who did not receive a tribal inheritance of land like the other tribes. Instead, they were given cities and surrounding lands to support their livestock and sustain their families. This arrangement underscores the importance of the Levites' role in Israelite society, as they were set apart for religious duties and service to God. The allocation of cities and pasturelands ensured their material needs were met, allowing them to focus on their spiritual responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jarmuth.htm">Jarmuth</a></b><br>A city allocated to the Levites within the territory of Issachar.

Earlier, <a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a> references another Jarmuth in Judah, reminding us that place names repeat; the text here clearly locates this Jarmuth in Issachar&#8217;s territory (see <a href="/joshua/19-21.htm">Joshua 19:21</a>).<p>- By granting a specific city, the Lord shows His faithfulness to meet the practical needs of the priestly tribe. <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a> records that Levites received no large land inheritance; instead, the Lord Himself was their portion, and He provided select towns in every tribe.<p>- The inclusion of Jarmuth underscores God&#8217;s detailed care: He knew exactly where each Levitical family would dwell and serve, fulfilling the earlier command of <a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>En-gannim</b><p>- The verse continues, &#8220;and En-gannim.&#8221; This town&#8217;s name means &#8220;spring of gardens,&#8221; pointing to abundant water&#8212;vital for both people and flocks. <a href="/joshua/19-21.htm">Joshua 19:21</a> lists En-gannim among Issachar&#8217;s cities, so its designation for Levites brings spiritual ministry into a fertile setting.<p>- Just as priests later served among exiles in Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>), Levites in En-gannim would bless surrounding families with instruction in God&#8217;s law (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>). The everyday rhythm of drawing water and tending gardens became an ongoing reminder of the living water the Lord supplies (<a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Four cities</b><p>- &#8220;&#8212;four cities&#8221; indicates that Jarmuth and En-gannim complete the tally alongside two earlier named towns, Kishion and Daberath (<a href="/joshua/21-28.htm">Joshua 21:28</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s distribution is precise: each Levitical clan received an exact number of cities (<a href="/joshua/21-3.htm">Joshua 21:3-8</a>). Nothing is random or overlooked; every location serves the larger plan of having spiritual leaders scattered throughout Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-19.htm">Deuteronomy 12:19</a>).<p>- The number four, while not emphasized symbolically here, practically shows completeness for the Gershonites within Issachar&#8217;s borders, paralleling the Kohathite and Merarite allocations in other tribes (<a href="/joshua/21-5.htm">Joshua 21:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pasturelands</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;together with their pasturelands&#8221; repeats a refrain found for every Levitical town (<a href="/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>). The Lord provided not only homes but also fields for their livestock, fulfilling <a href="/leviticus/25-32.htm">Leviticus 25:32-34</a>, which protects these lands as an everlasting possession for Levites.<p>- Pasturelands enabled Levites to support their families without farming extensive acreage, freeing them for teaching, judging, and temple service (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28-32</a>).<p>- This provision pictures the balance between spiritual vocation and daily livelihood, anticipating principles later echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>&#8212;those who serve at the altar are entitled to practical support.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29</a> affirms God&#8217;s meticulous faithfulness: He assigns Jarmuth and En-gannim, making four total Levitical cities in Issachar, each surrounded by pasturelands. These details demonstrate that the Lord supplies for His servants&#8217; material needs while positioning them to minister among the people. The verse invites us to trust that God still knows exactly where to place His people and how to provide for them, uniting practical care with spiritual purpose.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/21-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jarmuth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yar&#183;m&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3412.htm">Strong's 3412: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jarmuth -- a Canaanite city in Judah, also a city in Issachar</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and En-gannim&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(gan&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5873.htm">Strong's 5873: </a> </span><span class="str2">En-gannim -- 'spring of a garden', two places in Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">four</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_702.htm">Strong's 702: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cities,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">along with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Direct object marker<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their pasturelands.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7713;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#353;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4054.htm">Strong's 4054: </a> </span><span class="str2">A suburb, the area around a, building, the margin of the sea</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/21-29.htm">OT History: Joshua 21:29 Jarmuth with its suburbs En Gannim (Josh.
