The Israelites experienced God's intervention in battles, such as the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6) and the defeat of the Amorite kings (Joshua 10). This serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness to His covenant promises, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>, where God promised Abraham the land. The phrase underscores the importance of remembering God's past deeds as a foundation for faith and obedience.<p><b>because it was the LORD your God who fought for you</b><br>This highlights the divine nature of Israel's victories, attributing success not to military prowess but to God's intervention. This is consistent with the theme throughout the Old Testament, where God is depicted as a warrior fighting on behalf of His people (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate victory through Jesus Christ, who fights and wins the spiritual battle for humanity (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).
