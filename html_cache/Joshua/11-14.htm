In the context of the Israelite conquest, this was often seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to provide for His people. The taking of plunder and livestock was a means of sustaining the Israelite community as they settled in the Promised Land. This practice is consistent with earlier instructions given in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-14.htm">Deuteronomy 20:14</a>, where God allowed the Israelites to take plunder from cities that were far from them, but not from those within the land of Canaan.<p><b>but they put all the people to the sword until they had completely destroyed them</b><br>This phrase reflects the concept of herem, or the ban, which was a command for total destruction of certain peoples and cities. This was not merely an act of war but a divine judgment against the Canaanites for their idolatry and wickedness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a> and <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>. The complete destruction was intended to prevent the Israelites from being influenced by the Canaanite practices and to maintain the purity of worship to Yahweh.<p><b>not sparing anyone who breathed</b><br>The phrase underscores the totality of the destruction commanded by God. This was a difficult and controversial aspect of the conquest narrative, often raising questions about the nature of divine justice. However, it is important to understand this within the context of God's holiness and the need to eradicate sin and idolatry from the land. This act of judgment can be seen as a foreshadowing of the final judgment, where sin will be completely eradicated. It also serves as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where nothing that opposes God's kingdom will remain.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were fulfilling God's promise to give them the land of Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the Israelites, inhabited by various Canaanite tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_cities.htm">Canaanite Cities</a></b><br>The cities in the land of Canaan that were conquered by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_conquest.htm">The Conquest</a></b><br>The military campaign led by Joshua to take possession of the Promised Land as commanded by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' actions in <a href="/joshua/11-14.htm">Joshua 11:14</a> demonstrate their obedience to God's specific instructions.
