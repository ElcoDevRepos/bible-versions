The turning back of the border suggests a change in direction, indicating the complexity of the tribal boundaries. This reflects the detailed allocation of land among the tribes of Israel, as commanded by God through Moses and executed by Joshua. The precision in these descriptions underscores the importance of land inheritance in Israelite society, fulfilling God's promises to the patriarchs.<p><b>as far as the fortified city of Tyre</b><br>Tyre was a significant Phoenician city known for its strong fortifications and maritime prowess. Its mention here highlights the proximity of Israel's territory to influential neighboring cultures. Tyre's fortifications symbolize strength and resilience, and its inclusion in the boundary description emphasizes the strategic importance of the land allotted to Asher. Historically, Tyre was a center of commerce and trade, which would have influenced the surrounding regions, including Israel.<p><b>turned toward Hosah</b><br>Hosah is a lesser-known location, possibly a settlement near the coast. The turning of the border toward Hosah indicates a shift in the boundary line, further defining the extent of Asher's territory. This detail reflects the thoroughness of the land division process, ensuring each tribe received its allotted inheritance. The mention of Hosah, though obscure, contributes to the overall picture of the land distribution.<p><b>and came out at the Sea in the region of Achzib</b><br>Achzib was a coastal town within the territory of Asher, marking the western boundary of the land. The reference to the Sea indicates the Mediterranean, which was a crucial geographical feature for trade and travel. Achzib's location on the coast would have provided access to maritime resources and opportunities. The boundary reaching the Sea signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel a land extending to the sea, a promise reiterated in various parts of Scripture. The coastal boundary also foreshadows Israel's interactions with maritime cultures and the challenges and opportunities these would present.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramah.htm">Ramah</a></b><br>A location mentioned in the allotment of land to the tribe of Asher.

The detail reminds us that God is exact in His promises; every hill and field has value to Him (<a href="/genesis/13-17.htm">Genesis 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord had foretold abundance for Asher (<a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24&#8211;25</a>).

The verse traces a boundary that bends at Ramah, reaches mighty Tyre, angles toward Hosah, and finally meets the Mediterranean at Achzib. Every directional shift echoes God&#8217;s precise faithfulness in allotting Asher&#8217;s inheritance. The passage invites us to trust His promises, steward our own &#8220;territory,&#8221; and influence the world&#8212;coastlines and all&#8212;for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The strong city Tyre.</span> Rather, the <span class="accented">fortified</span> city. The general impression among commentators appears to be that the island city of Tyre, afterwards so famous, had not as yet come into existence. And the word here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> seems to be more in accordance with the idea of a land fortress than of one so exceptionally protected as an island fortress would be. This expression, like "great Zidon" above, implies the comparative antiquity of the Book of Joshua. The island city of Tyre, so famous in later history, was not yet founded. The city on the mainland (called Ancient Tyre by the historians) was "the chief seat of the population till the wars of the Assyrian monarchs against Phoenicia" (Kenrick, 'Phoenicia,' p. 344). He adds, "The situation of Palae-Tyrus was one of the most fertile spots on the coast of Phoenicia. The plain, is here about five miles wide; the soft is dark, and the variety of its productions excited the wonder of the Crusaders." William of Tyre, the historian of the Crusades, tells us that, although the territory was scanty in extent, "exiguitatem suam multa redimit ubertate." The position of Tyre, as a city of vast commercial importance and artistic skill in the time of David and Solomon, is clear enough from the sacred records. It appears still (<a href="/2_samuel/24-6.htm">2 Samuel 24:6, 7</a>) to have been on the mainland, for the successors of Rameses II., up to the time of Sheshonk, or Shishak, were unwarlike monarchs, and the Assyrian power had not yet attained its subsequent formidable dimensions. We meet with Eth-baal, or Itho-baal, in later Scripture history, remarkable as the murderer of the last of Hiram's descendants, and the father of the infamous Jezebel, from which we may conclude that a great moral and therefore political declension had taken place since the days of Hiram. The later history of Tyre may be inferred from the prophetic denunciations, intermingled with descriptive passages, found in <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/26.htm">Ezekiel 26, 27</a>; Joel (Joel 3:3-8) and Amos (Amos 1:9) had previously complained of the way in which the children of Israel had become the merchandise of Tyre, and had threatened the vengeance of God. But the minute and powerful description in <a href="/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, shows that Tyre was still great and prosperous. She was strong enough to resist the attacks of successive Assyrian monarchs. Shalmaneser's victorious expedition (so Alexander tells us) was driven back from the island fortress of Tyre. Sennacherib, in his vainglorious boast of the cities he has conquered (<a href="/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36, 37</a>.), makes no mention of Tyre. Even Nebuchadnezzar, though he took and destroyed Palae-Tyrus, appears to have been baffled in his attempt to reduce the island city. Shorn of much of its ancient glory, Tyre still remained powerful, and only succumbed, after a resistance of seven months, to the splendid military genius of Alexander the Great. But Alexander refounded Tyre, and its position and its commercial reputation secured for it a large part of its former importance. The city continued to flourish, even though Phoenicia was for a long period the battleground between the Syrian and the Egyptian monarchies. To Christian readers, the description by Eusebius of the splendid church erected at Tyre by its Bishop Paulinus will have an interest. He describes it as by far the finest in all Phoenicia, and appends the sermon he preached on the occasion. Even in the fourth century after Christ, St. Jerome ('Comm. ad Ezekiel,' 26:7.) wonders why the prophecy concerning Tyre has never been fulfilled. "Quod sequitur, 'nee aedificaberis ultra,' videtur facere quaestionem quomodo non sit aedificata, quam hodie cernimus nobilissimam et pulcherrimam civitatem." But the present state of Tyre warns us not to be too hasty in pronouncing any Scripture prophecy to have failed. Even Sidon is not the wretched collection of huts and ruined columns which is all that remains of the once proud city Tyre. <span class="cmt_word">And the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">and the western extremity is from Hebel to Achzib.</span> Hebel signifies a region or possession, as in ver. 9. Here, however, it seems to be a proper name. <span class="cmt_word">Achzib</span>. "A city of Asher, not conquered by that tribe (<a href="/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>), now the village of Zib, two-and-a-half hours north of Akka," or Acre (Vandevelde). Keil and Delitzsch make the journey a three hours' one.
