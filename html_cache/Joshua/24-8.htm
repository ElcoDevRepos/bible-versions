The Amorites were a significant Canaanite tribe inhabiting the region east of the Jordan River. This area is known today as modern-day Jordan. The Amorites were known for their fortified cities and were considered a formidable enemy. The phrase highlights God's guidance and provision in leading the Israelites to this land, fulfilling His promise to give them a homeland. This event is a continuation of God's covenant with Abraham, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, where God promised to give his descendants the land of the Amorites.<p><b>They fought against you,</b><br>The Amorites, like many other Canaanite tribes, resisted the Israelites' advance into the Promised Land. This resistance is documented in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-25</a>, where the Amorite kings Sihon and Og opposed Israel. The phrase underscores the reality of spiritual and physical battles that God's people face when moving into the promises of God. It also reflects the broader theme of spiritual warfare found throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p><b>but I delivered them into your hand,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and power in granting victory to the Israelites. The deliverance of the Amorites into Israel's hands is a testament to God's faithfulness and His role as a divine warrior on behalf of His people. This act of deliverance is reminiscent of God's intervention in battles throughout Israel's history, such as the victory at Jericho (Joshua 6). It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who conquers sin and death.<p><b>that you should possess their land</b><br>The possession of the Amorite land signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and his descendants. This act of taking possession is not merely a physical acquisition but also a spiritual inheritance. The land represents God's blessing and provision, a place where His people can live in covenant relationship with Him. This concept of inheritance is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<p><b>when I destroyed them before you.</b><br>The destruction of the Amorites is a demonstration of God's judgment against sin and idolatry, as the Amorites were known for their pagan practices. This act serves as a warning to Israel to remain faithful to God and avoid the idolatry of the surrounding nations. It also points to the ultimate judgment that will come upon the world, as described in Revelation. The destruction of the Amorites can be seen as a type of Christ's victory over evil, where He will ultimately destroy all powers opposed to God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.
