The Gibeonites were Hivites, a Canaanite people, and their decision to deceive Israel was a strategic move to preserve their lives. This reflects the broader context of Canaanite fear and response to Israel's conquests, as seen in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a> with Rahab's acknowledgment of Israel's God.<p><b>&#8216;Take provisions for your journey;</b><br>The mention of provisions suggests preparation for a long journey, which was part of the Gibeonites' ruse to appear as if they came from a distant land. This tactic was meant to align with the stipulations in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10-15</a>, where Israel was instructed to offer peace to distant cities, not those within Canaan. The Gibeonites' deception underscores the theme of cunning and survival in the face of impending destruction.<p><b>go to meet them and say to them:</b><br>This phrase indicates a proactive approach by the Gibeonites, emphasizing their initiative in seeking peace with Israel. It reflects the urgency and desperation of the Canaanite peoples as they faced the advancing Israelites. The act of going to meet Israel also signifies a form of submission and acknowledgment of Israel's power.<p><b>We are your servants.</b><br>By declaring themselves servants, the Gibeonites sought to establish a subordinate relationship with Israel, which was a common practice in ancient treaties where the weaker party would offer servitude in exchange for protection. This phrase echoes the humility and submission seen in other biblical narratives, such as Jacob's approach to Esau in <a href="/genesis/32-4.htm">Genesis 32:4-5</a>.<p><b>Please make a treaty with us.&#8217;</b><br>The request for a treaty highlights the Gibeonites' desire for a formal agreement that would ensure their safety. In the ancient Near East, treaties were binding and often involved oaths before deities, making them sacred and inviolable. This plea for a covenant mirrors the broader biblical theme of covenants as foundational to relationships, both human and divine, as seen in God's covenants with Noah, Abraham, and Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_gibeon.htm">Elders of Gibeon</a></b><br>The leaders of the Gibeonite people who devised a plan to deceive the Israelites into making a peace treaty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeonites.htm">Gibeonites</a></b><br>Inhabitants of Gibeon, a Canaanite city, who feared the Israelites and sought to make a treaty with them through deception.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Joshua, who were conquering the land of Canaan as God had commanded.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was responsible for making decisions regarding treaties and warfare.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites by God, which they were in the process of conquering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_seeking_god's_guidance.htm">Discernment and Seeking God&#8217;s Guidance</a></b><br>The Israelites failed to seek God's counsel before making a treaty with the Gibeonites.

Their unanimity highlights the widespread fear caused by Israel&#8217;s recent victories at Jericho and Ai (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a>; 9:24).<p>&#8226; The statement emphasizes deliberation, not impulse. They have weighed Israel&#8217;s unstoppable advance and conclude that negotiation is wiser than resistance (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Take provisions for your journey</b><p>&#8226; The elders instruct the envoys to pack stale, cracked bread and worn wineskins (<a href="/joshua/9-12.htm">Joshua 9:12&#8211;13</a>). The props reinforce their claim of coming from &#8220;a distant land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Similar travel provisions appear when David fled from Saul with consecrated bread (<a href="/1_samuel/21-3.htm">1 Samuel 21:3&#8211;6</a>); food often marks urgent, precarious journeys.<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that deception often mingles a fragment of truth (they really did travel) with carefully staged evidence (bread purposely left to mold). Scripture repeatedly warns about judging only by outward appearance (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go to meet them</b><p>&#8226; Rather than wait for Israel to arrive, the Gibeonites travel to Gilgal (<a href="/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>). Initiative gives them a strategic advantage; first impressions shape negotiations.<p>&#8226; Throughout Joshua, meeting &#8220;face to face&#8221; signals turning points&#8212;Rahab meets the spies (<a href="/joshua/2-2.htm">Joshua 2:2&#8211;4</a>), the commander of the LORD&#8217;s army meets Joshua (<a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13&#8211;15</a>). Here, the meeting presents Israel with its most subtle test yet: Can they discern truth from pretense?<p>&#8226; Centuries later, Gibeon becomes a place where God answers Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4&#8211;5</a>), showing the lasting effect of this encounter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Say to them: We are your servants</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Servants&#8221; (literally, bond-servants) expresses total submission&#8212;much like Jacob&#8217;s repeated message to Esau, &#8220;Your servant Jacob says&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-18.htm">Genesis 32:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The language flatters Joshua, inviting him to see the Gibeonites as harmless dependents rather than as Canaanite neighbors under God&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s leaders later repeat the phrase when confronted: &#8220;Your servants were clearly told&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/9-24.htm">Joshua 9:24</a>), proving the ruse worked. The episode illustrates Jesus&#8217; caution, &#8220;Be as shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please make a treaty with us</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;treaty&#8221; (covenant) invokes solemn, binding commitments (<a href="/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/joshua/9-15.htm">Joshua 9:15</a>). Gibeon seeks the very protection God had reserved for distant nations willing to surrender (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10&#8211;15</a>), while hoping Israel will overlook the command not to covenant with Canaanites (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The request exposes a tension: God&#8217;s people must balance mercy with obedience. Israel errs by failing to consult the LORD first (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>), teaching that even obvious acts of kindness require prayerful discernment.<p>&#8226; Once sworn, the covenant stands. Centuries later, Saul&#8217;s violation of it brings famine until David makes restitution (<a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1&#8211;3</a>). God holds His people to their word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-11.htm">Joshua 9:11</a> records the carefully crafted script Gibeon&#8217;s leaders give their envoys. Every clause&#8212;authority of elders, deceptive provisions, proactive meeting, humble self-designation, plea for covenant&#8212;shows a calculated bid for survival. The verse underscores Israel&#8217;s need for constant reliance on the LORD&#8217;s guidance, reminds us that appearances can mislead, and showcases God&#8217;s insistence that His people honor sworn promises even when obtained under false pretenses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our elders.</span> Gibeon and its allied cities did not possess a regal government (see note on ver. 3). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/9-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the elders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1456;&#1469;&#1511;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#601;&#183;q&#234;&#183;n&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct &#124;
