The tribe of Ephraim was known for its strength and leadership among the northern tribes, often taking a prominent role in Israel's history. The southern boundary of Ephraim's territory was significant as it bordered the tribe of Benjamin, which included the city of Jerusalem, a central location in Israel's religious and political life.<p><b>and Manasseh&#8217;s was to the north</b><br>Manasseh, the firstborn son of Joseph, was also blessed by Jacob, though with a lesser blessing than Ephraim. The tribe of Manasseh was unique in that it was divided into two parts: one portion settled on the east side of the Jordan River, and the other on the west. The western portion of Manasseh's territory was north of Ephraim, indicating a close relationship between the two tribes, both geographically and historically. This division of land reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the inheritance of the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>having the Sea as its border</b><br>The "Sea" referred to here is the Mediterranean Sea, which formed the western boundary of the land allotted to the tribes of Israel. This boundary was significant for trade and interaction with other cultures, as the Mediterranean was a major route for commerce and communication in the ancient world. The coastal region was also a point of contention with the Philistines and other sea peoples, who frequently clashed with Israel.<p><b>and adjoining Asher on the north</b><br>The tribe of Asher was located to the north of Manasseh's territory. Asher's land was known for its fertility and abundance, particularly in olive oil production (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24</a>). The proximity of Manasseh to Asher highlights the interconnectedness of the tribes and their shared responsibilities in defending and cultivating the land. This northern boundary also underscores the strategic importance of the tribes in maintaining Israel's security against northern invaders.<p><b>and Issachar on the east</b><br>Issachar's territory lay to the east of Manasseh, in the fertile Jezreel Valley, which was a crucial agricultural area. The tribe of Issachar was known for its wisdom and understanding of the times (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>), playing a vital role in the socio-political landscape of Israel. The eastern boundary with Issachar emphasizes the cooperative nature of the tribes in managing the land and resources God had provided. This arrangement reflects the broader theme of unity and diversity within the nation of Israel, as each tribe had its unique role and contribution to the whole.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's younger son, Ephraim.

The verse highlights God&#8217;s meticulous boundary-setting, the complementary roles of Joseph&#8217;s sons, and the call for faithful stewardship of the territory He assigns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they met together.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">they</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Manassites) <span class="accented">impinged</span> (this is the very same word as the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "touched upon." There has been great discussion concerning this passage. The literal meaning is clearly that Manasseh was bordered by Asher on the north, and Issachar on the east. The idea of an Asher-ham-Michmethah must be given up if we take this rendering of the Hebrew. Its only justification is the fact that if Michmethah be at once the northern border of Ephraim and Manasseh, the territory of Manasseh is cut almost in half. And, in fact, such a supposition makes confusion worse confounded. Is it probable that in vers. 7 and 10 Asher-ham-Michmethah is meant; that the town Asher is mentioned in similar terms to the tribe Issachar in the latter verse; and that in ver. 11, without a single intimation of the change of meaning, the tribes Issachar and Asher are mentioned? Again: if Dor - considerably to the south of Mount Carmel - was within the territory of Asher (ver. 11), how can we possibly, as Conder's 'Handbook' does, place the limits of Asher at Accho, and bring Zebulun to the sea (which it never reaches, for "toward the sea," in <a href="/joshua/19-11.htm">Joshua 19:11</a> clearly means "westward"), interposing a large strip of territory between Manasseh and Asher, placing Dor, in spite of ver. 11, far within the limits of Manasseh, and giving this last tribe, or rather half tribe, an extraordinarily disproportioned share of the land? (See the complaint in ver. 16). Zebulun, too, was on the eastern border of Asher (<a href="/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), and it is by no means certain that Shihor Libnath (see <a href="/joshua/19-26.htm">Joshua 19:26</a>) is not the Wady Zerka, south of Dor. This is the view of Knobel, a commentator by no means void of acuteness. This contraction of Manasseh's territory explains why cities had to be given to it out of Asher and Issachar, as well as the complaint in the latter part of this chapter. Issachar, <span class="accented">too</span>, must have stretched considerably southward. But the vagueness of the description of Manasseh's border, especially on the north, prevents us from assigning any limits to Issachar in this direction; while it is impossible, with a writer in the Quarterly Papers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, to suppose that it extended from Jezreel and Shunem and Endor on the north as far as Jericho to the south. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/17-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ephraim&#8217;s [territory]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
