Joshua is instructed to prepare the people spiritually, indicating that their current state is not aligned with God's holiness. The act of consecration involves purification and setting apart for God's purposes, a common practice in Israelite worship (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10-14</a>). It underscores the need for holiness before God can act on their behalf.<p><b>&#8216;Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow,</b><br>The call to consecrate themselves "for tomorrow" suggests preparation for a significant event or divine intervention. This mirrors the preparation before crossing the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/3-5.htm">Joshua 3:5</a>). It emphasizes the need for internal readiness and repentance, as God often requires His people to be spiritually prepared before He delivers them or reveals His will.<p><b>for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:</b><br>This phrase establishes the authority of the message. It is not Joshua's command but a direct word from God, reinforcing the seriousness of the situation. The title "the God of Israel" reminds the people of their covenant relationship with God, who has delivered them in the past and expects their obedience.<p><b>Among you, O Israel, there are things devoted to destruction.</b><br>The "things devoted to destruction" refer to items that were supposed to be destroyed or dedicated to God as part of the ban (herem) on Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-19</a>). This violation by Achan (<a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>) has brought sin into the camp, affecting the entire community. It highlights the communal nature of sin and its consequences, as well as the importance of obedience to God's commands.<p><b>You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them.</b><br>This statement reveals the direct correlation between Israel's spiritual state and their military success. The inability to stand against their enemies is a result of disobedience and impurity within the camp. It underscores the principle that victory and blessing are contingent upon faithfulness to God. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are tied to obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.
