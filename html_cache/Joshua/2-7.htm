This reflects the heightened tension and fear among the Canaanites as Israel approaches. Historically, Jericho was a fortified city, and its king would have been vigilant against threats. The pursuit of the spies underscores the strategic importance of intelligence in warfare, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the story of Gideon (Judges 7).<p><b>along the road to the fords of the Jordan</b><br>The fords of the Jordan were shallow crossing points, crucial for travel and trade. This geographical detail highlights the spies' likely escape route back to the Israelite camp. The Jordan River served as a natural boundary for the Promised Land, and its fords were strategic locations. This pursuit along the road to the fords indicates the king's understanding of the spies' intentions to return to their people, emphasizing the interconnectedness of geography and biblical narrative.<p><b>and as soon as they had gone out, the gate was shut</b><br>The shutting of the gate signifies the city's defensive measures, common in ancient walled cities to protect against intruders. This action reflects the urgency and seriousness with which the king of Jericho treated the threat of espionage. In a broader biblical context, gates often symbolize security and control, as seen in Nehemiah's rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and gates (Nehemiah 3). The closing of the gate also foreshadows the eventual fall of Jericho, where the city's defenses are rendered ineffective by divine intervention (Joshua 6).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men.htm">The Men</a></b><br>These are the king of Jericho's men who were sent to capture the Israelite spies.

The verse invites us to trust that even when opposition seems organized and gates seem shut, the Lord orchestrates events to fulfill His sure promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the fords.</span> There were several of these fords. One near Jericho (cf, <a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>; <a href="/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5, 6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22, 24</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-16.htm">2 Samuel 19:16, 19, 39</a>); one at Bethsean, now Beisan, leading to Succoth (<a href="/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>. See Robinson, ' Biblical Researches' 2:497; Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine'); beside others not mentioned in Scripture. A vivid description of the crossing the Jordan at the fords near Jericho is to be found in Tristrain's 'Land of Israel,' p. 520. The ford is almost certainly the one mentioned here, since an hour or two's ride brought the party to Shittim. These fords were easy to cross save when the Jordan, as was now the case (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>), overflowed its banks. This may have been the reason why the pursuers did not cross the fords, but they pursued the spies to the fords, hoping to find their retreat cut off. This is rendered more probable by the fact (ver. 22) that the pursuers appear to have continued their search after leaving the fords. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the [king's] men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
