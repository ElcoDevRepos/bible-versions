The "whole congregation" refers to the collective tribes of Israel, highlighting the communal nature of their covenant with God. This reflects the importance of unity in worship and obedience, as seen in other instances where the community acts together, such as in the assembly at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19).<p><b>What is this breach of faith you have committed today against the God of Israel:</b><br>A "breach of faith" implies a serious violation of trust and covenant with God. The Israelites were bound by a covenant that required exclusive worship and obedience to Yahweh. This phrase echoes the concern for maintaining purity in worship, as seen in the warnings against idolatry in <a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a>. The historical context involves the Israelites' recent settlement in the Promised Land, where maintaining faithfulness was crucial for their continued blessing and protection.<p><b>by turning away from the LORD:</b><br>Turning away from the LORD signifies apostasy, a grave sin in the Israelite community. This phrase underscores the danger of deviating from God's commands, which often led to dire consequences, as illustrated in the stories of the judges and kings who turned to other gods. The call to remain steadfast is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, emphasizing the need for loyalty to God.<p><b>and building for yourselves an altar:</b><br>Building an altar outside of the designated place of worship was seen as an act of rebellion. The centralization of worship in one location, eventually the temple in Jerusalem, was crucial for maintaining religious unity and orthodoxy. This act could be perceived as setting up a rival place of worship, akin to the sin of Jeroboam who established alternative worship sites (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p><b>that you might rebel against the LORD this day?:</b><br>Rebellion against the LORD is a serious accusation, suggesting intentional defiance. This reflects the covenantal relationship where God is the sovereign ruler, and Israel is His chosen people. Rebellion is often equated with idolatry and disobedience, leading to judgment and exile, as seen in the prophetic warnings throughout the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah. The concern here is not just for the immediate act but for the potential long-term spiritual consequences for the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribes_of_reuben,_gad,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">The Tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the Half-Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>These tribes had settled on the east side of the Jordan River and were accused of building an altar in rebellion against God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Whole Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>Represented by the leaders and elders, they confronted the eastern tribes about their actions, fearing it was a breach of faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas,_son_of_eleazar_the_priest.htm">Phinehas, Son of Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>He was sent with ten chiefs to address the potential rebellion, showing the seriousness of the situation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>Built by the eastern tribes, it was perceived as a potential rival to the altar of the LORD, which could lead to idolatry or division.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The central place of worship at the time, where the tabernacle was located, representing the unity of worship for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_worship.htm">Unity in Worship</a></b><br>The importance of maintaining unity in worship and doctrine is crucial.

The Hebrew word signifies to act deceitfully or faithlessly. It was an act of ingratitude towards the God who had established them in the good land in which they now found themselves. Such ingratitude and desertion of God was equivalent to rebellion, the term used immediately afterwards. The embassy clearly assumed that the fault had been committed, and that it would be necessary to proceed to extremities. Yet, deeply moved as they were, they did not refuse to listen to reason, and rejoiced that it was not necessary to inflict the fearful vengeance which otherwise would have been their duty. How great a contrast is this to the readiness, nay, even the eagerness, which many owning the Christian name have displayed to destroy the body, and the soul also, if that were possible, of their brethren in Christ, who have been overtaken, or have been supposed to be overtaken, in a similar fault! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/22-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the whole</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1500;
