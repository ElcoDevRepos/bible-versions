Moses, raised in Pharaoh's household, was uniquely positioned to confront Egyptian authority. Aaron, his brother, served as his spokesperson. This divine selection underscores God's sovereignty in choosing leaders. Moses is a type of Christ, as both are deliverers of their people. The sending of Moses and Aaron fulfills God's promise to Abraham about the deliverance of his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>).<p><b>and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there</b><br>The afflictions refer to the ten plagues God sent upon Egypt, demonstrating His power over the Egyptian gods and Pharaoh. Each plague targeted specific deities, showcasing the futility of Egyptian religion. This act of judgment was both a punishment for Egypt's oppression and a means to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. The plagues are a foreshadowing of the final judgment and a reminder of God's justice and mercy.<p><b>and afterward I brought you out</b><br>The exodus from Egypt is a pivotal event in Israel's history, symbolizing salvation and liberation. It marks the transition from slavery to freedom and the beginning of the journey to the Promised Land. This deliverance is celebrated annually in the Passover, which prefigures Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection.

Add to this the fact that this speech is ascribed to Joshua, and that the historian, as we have seen, had access to authentic sources of information, and we cannot avoid the conclusion that the hypothesis of the existence of the written law of Moses at the time of the death of Joshua has a very high degree of probability. The word rendered "plagued" is literally <span class="accented">smote</span>, but usually with the idea of a visitation from God. <span class="cmt_word">And afterward I brought you out.</span> The absence of any mention of the plagues here is noteworthy. It cannot be accounted for on the supposition that our author was ignorant of them, for we have ample proof that the Book of Joshua was compiled subsequently to the Pentateuch. This is demonstrated by the quotations, too numerous to specify here, which have been noticed in their place. We can only, therefore, regard the omission made simply for the sake of brevity, and because they were so well known to all, as a sign of that tendency, noticed under ver. 1, to abstain from that amplification of marvels common to all mythical histories. Had Joshua desired to indulge a poetic imagination, an admirable opportunity was here afforded him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/24-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1438;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
