In ancient Israel, cities were often fortified centers of administration and trade, while villages were smaller, agricultural communities. The mention of both cities and villages highlights the comprehensive nature of the inheritance, ensuring that both strategic and everyday living areas were accounted for. This reflects the importance of community and infrastructure in the tribal allocations.<p><b>set apart for the descendants of Ephraim</b><br>The descendants of Ephraim were one of the tribes of Israel, named after Joseph's second son, Ephraim. Ephraim was blessed by Jacob (Israel) in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where Jacob prophesied that Ephraim would become a multitude of nations. The setting apart of cities and villages for Ephraim signifies the fulfillment of this blessing and the tribe's prominent role in the history of Israel. Ephraim often symbolized the northern kingdom of Israel, and its territory was central to the nation's identity.<p><b>within the inheritance of Manasseh</b><br>Manasseh, the elder brother of Ephraim, was also a son of Joseph. The inheritance of Manasseh was divided into two parts: one on the east side of the Jordan River and one on the west. The phrase indicates that Ephraim's cities and villages were located within the western portion of Manasseh's inheritance. This reflects the close relationship between the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, both descended from Joseph, and highlights the interconnectedness of the tribal territories. The allocation of land within another tribe's inheritance underscores the complexity of land distribution and the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Ephraim.

The verse invites us to trust the same faithful God who arranges boundaries, supplies needs, and unites His people for their good and His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh;</span> and <a href="/context/joshua/17-10.htm" title="Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.">Joshua 17:10-11</a> : <span class= "ital">"</span>Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher, Beth-shean," &c. This fact would manifestly tend to produce a <span class= "ital">solidarity </span>among the several tribes, and to prevent disunion by creating common interests. The interest of the stronger tribes would be served by completing the conquest of the territory assigned to the weaker. And the general formation thus produced would resemble that which was known by the name of the <span class= "ital">testudo, </span>or tortoise, in Roman warfare. When a body of soldiers approached the wall of a town which it was intended to assault, they sometimes held their shields over them, overlapping like scales, each man's shield partly sheltering his own, and partly his neighbour's body, so that no missile could penetrate. Thus it may be said not only of Jerusalem, but of all the tribes in the land of their possession, that they were built as a city that is compact together, and at unity in itself: united by joints and bands, so that if one member of the body politic should suffer, all the members must suffer with it. For a further illustration of the same topic, see on the inheritance of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-11.htm" title="And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.">Joshua 18:11</a>) and of Simeon (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm" title="And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.">Joshua 19:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - And the separate cities. Literally, <span class="accented">and the cities divided off.</span> The word "were," in our version, is misplaced. It should be read thus: "And there were cities divided off and assigned to the tribe of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh" (see note on ver. 5). This fact, together with the compensation given to Manasseh, may serve to explain the cohesion of the ten tribes in opposition to Judah. The boundaries of the latter tribe were more strictly defined, her attitude more exclusive. We may almost discern this in the prominence given to Judah in the present book. Ephraim, already enraged at the passing away of the pre-eminence from itself, which had not merely been predicted, but, as <a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1-3</a> and Judges 12:1 show, had been actually enjoyed, was closely allied to Manasseh, and Manasseh to Issachar and Zebulun, by the arrangement we are considering. It would naturally be able, by its position and these circumstances, to combine together the rest of the tribe against the somewhat overbearing attitude of the tribe of Judah (see <a href="/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/16-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[along] with all the cities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;he&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
