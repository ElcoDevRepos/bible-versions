Gilgal was Israel's base camp after crossing the Jordan River, a place of spiritual significance where they renewed their covenant with God (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-24</a>). This request highlights the Gibeonites' reliance on their new alliance with Israel, despite their previous deception.<p><b>&#8220;Do not abandon your servants.</b><br>The Gibeonites refer to themselves as "servants," acknowledging their subordinate position due to the treaty. This plea underscores the covenantal relationship, which in ancient Near Eastern culture was binding and required mutual support. It reflects the biblical theme of faithfulness to one's word, as seen in God's faithfulness to His covenants.<p><b>Come quickly and save us!</b><br>The urgency in their plea indicates the immediate threat they faced. This echoes the biblical principle of seeking deliverance from a higher power, paralleling Israel's own cries for salvation throughout their history (e.g., <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>). It also foreshadows the salvation offered through Christ, who responds to those who call upon Him.<p><b>Help us, because all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country have joined forces against us.&#8221;</b><br>The Amorites were a significant Canaanite group, and their coalition against Gibeon represents a formidable threat. The hill country refers to the central highlands of Canaan, a strategic and contested region. This alliance against Gibeon illustrates the broader conflict between Israel and the Canaanite nations, fulfilling God's promise to give Israel victory over their enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). The gathering of these kings can be seen as a type of the end-times gathering of nations against God's people, as prophesied in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to succeed Moses and lead the people into the Promised Land.

The Gibeonites, bound to Israel by oath, appeal for faithfulness; Joshua is summoned to embody God&#8217;s own promise never to forsake His people. Their urgent plea and the looming Amorite alliance set the stage for one of Scripture&#8217;s most dramatic deliverances. The verse teaches that covenant loyalty obligates action, that God hears urgent cries through His appointed leaders, and that no coalition can prevail against a people upheld by the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The Amorites that dwell in the mountains</span>--i.e., in the mountainous district lying on the south of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Gilgal.</span> See note on Joshua 9:6. <span class="cmt_word">That dwell in the mountains.</span> Another life like touch.

It was only known that the storm was to break on them from the mountain region, Jerusalem (ver. 4) being the head quarters of the expedition. As a matter of fact, the kings who formed the confederacy principally inhabited the lowlands, as we have seen.
