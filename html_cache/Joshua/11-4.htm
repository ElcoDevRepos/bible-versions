Historically, such alliances were common in the ancient Near East when facing a common threat. The unification of these kings highlights the perceived threat of Israel's advance under Joshua's leadership. This mirrors earlier biblical narratives where enemies unite against God's people, such as in <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a> with the kings against Abraham.<p><b>a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the vast number of the enemy forces, drawing a parallel to God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>, where his descendants would be as numerous as the sand on the seashore. The contrast here is stark: the promise of blessing to Abraham's seed versus the overwhelming opposition they face. It underscores the miraculous nature of Israel's victories, attributing success to divine intervention rather than military might.<p><b>along with a great number of horses and chariots</b><br>Horses and chariots were symbols of military power and technological advancement in ancient warfare, often associated with the might of Egypt and other powerful nations. The presence of these in the Canaanite coalition suggests a formidable and well-equipped force. Biblically, reliance on horses and chariots is often contrasted with reliance on God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), highlighting the theme of faith over human strength. This also foreshadows the eventual command in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> for Israel not to multiply horses, emphasizing trust in God rather than military power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_kings.htm">Canaanite Kings</a></b><br>These were the leaders of various city-states in Canaan who united against Israel.

Their joint march is an historical event, not a legend.<p>&#8226; God had already foretold that the nations of Canaan would &#8220;rise up against&#8221; Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> describes the age-old pattern of earthly powers gathering together &#8220;against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221; This scene in Joshua fits that pattern perfectly.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores human resistance to God&#8217;s plan; yet, as <a href="/joshua/11-6.htm">Joshua 11:6</a> will show, the Lord is neither surprised nor threatened.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with all their armies</b><p>Every soldier is summoned. The kings hold nothing back because they grasp the threat Israel poses under God&#8217;s leadership.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2-3</a>, Jabin of Hazor later does the same, calling out his entire force against Israel.<p>&#8226; First Samuel 17:1 records the Philistines&#8217; full deployment against Saul and Israel. Such military maximum effort is the typical human response when God&#8217;s people advance in obedience.<p>&#8226; The point: Israel is facing the combined strength of Canaan, proving that the coming victory will be unmistakably the Lord&#8217;s doing (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore</b><p>The text paints an overwhelming picture of size.<p>&#8226; Similar language describes Abraham&#8217;s promised descendants (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>) and later enemy hordes (<a href="/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The figure stresses impossibility from a human standpoint. Israel&#8217;s relatively smaller host cannot match such numbers&#8212;yet God repeatedly delights in overturning the odds (see <a href="/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Knowing the literal enormity of the threat magnifies the glory of the pending divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with a great number of horses and chariots</b><p>The kings possess the era&#8217;s most fearsome military technology.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a> acknowledges that horses and chariots can intimidate, but immediately reminds Israel, &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8230;for the LORD your God is with you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Egypt&#8217;s chariot force drowned in the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6-28</a>); <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> contrasts those who trust in chariots with those who trust in the name of the LORD.<p>&#8226; Israel itself had been warned against multiplying horses (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>), so the unequal matchup highlights Israel&#8217;s dependence on divine strength rather than weaponry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a> records a real, vast coalition&#8212;fully armed, numerically staggering, technologically superior&#8212;mobilizing to crush Israel. The verse sets the stage for God to demonstrate that no earthly alliance can stand against His covenant purposes. By noting the totality of the enemy&#8217;s resources, Scripture heightens the reader&#8217;s awareness that Israel&#8217;s forthcoming victory will be solely attributable to the Lord&#8217;s power, keeping the focus on His faithfulness and glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And they went out.</span> Dean Stanley (Lectures, 1:259) compares this "last struggle" of the Canaanites with the conflict between the Saxons and the British chiefs "driven to the Land's End." The comparison is more picturesque than accurate. In the first place, it was by no means a "last struggle" (see ver. 21; <a href="/joshua/18-3.htm">Joshua 18:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4</a>. throughout). In the next, the Britons were never driven to the Land's End, but Dorsetshire, which retained its independence for 200 years, was treated by Ina as Gezer (<a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>), was treated by the Ephraimites, while Devonshire and Cornwall came very gradually and almost peacefully under the hands of the conquerors. And thirdly, even had it been otherwise, there is a vast difference between a handful of desperate men driven to bay on a tongue of land surrounded nearly on every side by the sea, and a powerful, though defeated, nation with a vast continent in its rear. Yet there are many features common to the history of the Israelites in Canaan, and of the Teutonic tribes in Britain (see Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">As the sand that is upon the sea shore.</span> This poetic phrase is common in the Hebrew writings (see <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>; <a href="/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>, etc.). Solomon's capacious intellect is compared to the sand on the sea shore, in <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29</a>. The word translated "shore" is "lip" in the original, a word which adds to the poetry of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">And horses and chariots very many.</span> Literally, many ex<span class="accented">ceedingly.</span> The Israelites appear to have held cavalry and chariots in great awe (see <a href="/exodus/14-18.htm">Exodus 14:18</a>, and the song of triumph in <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>; cf. also <a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16, 18</a>; <a href="/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>; <a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>). In later times they appear to have become more used to them. See, for instance, <a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, where the historian gives their number, large as it was, instead of regarding it as past all computation. This battle must have taken place on level ground, or the chariots would have been useless. Accordingly the historian fixes its scene on the banks of "the waters of Merom," where such ground is to be found - another instance of his historical accuracy (see Vandevelde, Journey 2:413, who places the battle on the great plain southwest of the latter). The use of chariots in battle dates from an early period. Homer's heroes are described as driven to battle in them. But perhaps the scythe chariots are here meant, which are not found on early Egyptian monuments, but which Xenophon in his Cyropaedia says were introduced By Cyrus. We find them, however, in use in Britain, in the days of Julius Caesar, and they could hardly have obtained the idea from the Persians. Potter (Antiquities, bk. 3. ch. 1.) says that they were gradually abandoned when they were found more dangerous to those who used them than to the enemy. That this kind of chariot is here meant seems pretty certain from the alarm they caused. No such alarm would have been caused by chariots simply used to convey the chieftains to the fight (see Gesenius, <span class="accented">s.v.</span> Xenophon, Cyr. 6:4; and 2 Macc. 13:2). <span class="cmt_word">All their hosts</span>.
