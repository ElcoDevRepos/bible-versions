In the ancient Near Eastern context, celestial bodies were often associated with deities, but here, the God of Israel demonstrates His sovereignty over creation. This event underscores God's direct intervention in human affairs, particularly in support of His chosen people. The miracle is a testament to God's power and His commitment to fulfilling His promises to Israel.<p><b>and the moon stopped</b><br>The mention of the moon stopping alongside the sun emphasizes the completeness of the miracle. In the Hebrew calendar, which is lunar-based, the moon's position was crucial for timekeeping. This event signifies a suspension of natural order, highlighting the extraordinary nature of God's intervention. It also serves as a reminder of God's control over time and space, reinforcing His omnipotence.<p><b>until the nation took vengeance upon its enemies</b><br>This phrase indicates the purpose of the miracle: to allow Israel to achieve victory over its adversaries. The context is the battle against the Amorite kings, where Israel needed more time to secure a decisive victory. This act of divine intervention aligns with God's covenant promises to give Israel the land of Canaan and to protect them from their enemies. It also reflects the biblical theme of divine justice and retribution against those who oppose God's people.<p><b>Is this not written in the Book of Jashar?</b><br>The Book of Jashar is a non-canonical text referenced in the Old Testament, also mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>. It is thought to be a collection of poetic writings or songs celebrating Israel's heroes and significant events. The citation of this book lends historical credibility to the account, suggesting that the event was well-known and recorded in other ancient sources. It also highlights the importance of oral and written traditions in preserving Israel's history.<p><b>&#8220;So the sun stopped in the middle of the sky</b><br>This repetition emphasizes the miraculous nature of the event. The sun's position "in the middle of the sky" suggests it was midday, a time when the sun would be at its peak. This detail underscores the dramatic pause in time, allowing Israel to continue their battle in daylight. It serves as a powerful reminder of God's ability to alter the natural world for the sake of His people.<p><b>and delayed going down about a full day.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "about a full day" indicates the extent of the miracle, suggesting an extension of daylight far beyond normal limits. This prolonged day allowed Israel to achieve complete victory, demonstrating God's provision and support. The event foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people over evil, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture. It also prefigures the eternal light and victory found in Jesus Christ, who is described as the "light of the world" in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

But, as before, it refers naturally enough to the sun's <span class="accented">light.</span> The declining sun continued to shine upon Gibeon, and in the neighbourhood, upon the descent from Beth-heron the Upper, and on the whole region throughout which the fugitive Canaanites were scattered. We need not suppose that <span class="accented">all</span> the discomfited host fled in one direction, and possibly in the neighbourhood of Gibeon itself there remained quite enough of the scattered portions of the host to need urgently the sun's light to complete their destruction. <span class="cmt_word">The midst.</span> The Hebrew here is not the usual word for midst. It signifies literally, the <span class="accented">half. <span class="cmt_word"></span>About a whole day.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">as a perfect day.</span> The LXX. renders <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate, "Non festinavit occumbere spatio unius dict." What is the precise meaning of this passage it is difficult to say. The language is very obscure. It has been usually interpreted to mean that the sun remained in the heavens twelve hours longer than usual. But this, though the most natural, is by no means the only interpretation of the passage. The words, "did not hasten to go down as a perfect day," cannot be <span class="accented">proved</span> to have this meaning. In fact, it is difficult to fix a precise meaning on them. They belong rather to the domain of poetry than history, and their language is that of hyperbole rather than of exact narration of facts. Consequently, we are not entitled to build conclusions upon them, or draw arguments from them. It seems tolerably clear that twelve additional hours could hardly have been required by the Israelites for the complete extermination of their enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the sun</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1436;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;e&#183;me&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
