The Israelites, under divine command, were executing judgment on the Canaanite kings and their armies. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The term "terrible slaughter" underscores the completeness of the victory, which was necessary to establish Israel in the land and prevent the influence of Canaanite idolatry.<p><b>until they had finished them off</b><br>The phrase indicates the thoroughness of the campaign. The Israelites were commanded to leave no survivors among the enemy forces, which was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern warfare to ensure total victory and prevent future retaliation. This also served to fulfill God's command to eradicate the Canaanite nations due to their abominable practices, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>.<p><b>and the remaining survivors retreated to the fortified cities</b><br>This part of the verse shows the strategic retreat of the remaining Canaanite forces. Fortified cities were common in ancient Canaan, providing refuge and defense against invaders. The mention of these cities highlights the ongoing challenge Israel faced in fully possessing the land, as these strongholds would need to be conquered in subsequent campaigns.
