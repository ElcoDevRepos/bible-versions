The "battle lance" symbolizes leadership and authority in warfare. Joshua's steadfastness can be compared to Moses holding up his hands during the battle against the Amalekites (<a href="/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11-12</a>), signifying perseverance and divine support. The act of not drawing back his hand indicates complete dedication to God's command, reflecting the importance of obedience in achieving victory.<p><b>until he had devoted to destruction</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," which involves dedicating something to God, often through complete destruction. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, especially in the context of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan, where certain cities and peoples were to be completely destroyed as an act of divine judgment. This reflects the seriousness of God's commands and the need for purity among His people, as well as the fulfillment of divine justice.<p><b>all who lived in Ai</b><br>Ai was a Canaanite city, and its destruction was part of the broader conquest of the Promised Land. The complete destruction of Ai's inhabitants underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to the Israelites and the removal of idolatrous influences. This act also serves as a warning against disobedience and the consequences of sin, as seen in the earlier defeat at Ai due to Achan's sin (Joshua 7). The destruction of Ai can be seen as a type of final judgment, foreshadowing the ultimate victory over sin and evil through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.

His arm stays extended for the entire engagement, reflecting servant-leadership that refuses to quit until God&#8217;s word is fulfilled (cf. <a href="/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11-13</a>, where Moses&#8217; upheld hands keep Israel victorious).<p>&#8226; Literally keeping a limb raised is tiring; Scripture highlights the cost of obedience, yet also God&#8217;s enabling grace (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua models steadfast faith that contrasts with leaders who faltered&#8212;Saul, for example, lowered his resolve and spared what God had said to destroy (<a href="/1_samuel/15-17.htm">1 Samuel 15:17-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that held his battle lance</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;battle lance&#8221; (or javelin) is no random prop; back in <a href="/joshua/8-18.htm">Joshua 8:18</a> the LORD specifically told Joshua, &#8220;Stretch out the javelin in your hand toward Ai, for into your hand I will deliver the city.&#8221; The same weapon now stays lifted as a visible sign that the victory still flows from God&#8217;s promise.<p>&#8226; Raising the spear serves as a rallying point for Israel&#8217;s forces, much like Gideon&#8217;s trumpets and torches in <a href="/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a> announce divine strategy.<p>&#8226; The object in Joshua&#8217;s hand reminds us that God often uses tangible symbols&#8212;Moses&#8217; staff (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-5</a>) or the bronze serpent (<a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>)&#8212;to connect faith to action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until he had devoted to destruction</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Devoted to destruction&#8221; refers to placing something under God&#8217;s ban: it must be fully given over to Him, usually by being destroyed (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>; 20:16-18). This is not human cruelty but divine judgment on entrenched wickedness (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua&#8217;s unbroken stance highlights complete obedience; partial compliance would have been disobedience, as Saul learned at Amalek (<a href="/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that God&#8217;s commands have a clear, non-negotiable finish line&#8212;faith presses on until the assignment is entirely done (<a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all who lived in Ai</b><p>&#8226; The destruction is total, because the sin and idolatry of Ai are total.

Ai shows the stark alternative when a city remains hardened.<p>&#8226; The completeness of the judgment points forward to the ultimate, final judgment where every unrepentant sinner faces eternal separation from God (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a> captures determined obedience. Joshua keeps his weapon raised&#8212;just as God directed&#8212;until every aspect of the mission is finished. The lifted lance signals divine authority, rallies the troops, and underscores that victory belongs to the LORD. The thorough judgment on Ai fulfills God&#8217;s righteous decree, reminding believers that partial obedience is disobedience, and that perseverance, though costly, is always rewarded by the faithfulness of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Utterly destroyed.</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (see note on Joshua 6:17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/8-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
