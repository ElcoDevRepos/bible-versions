The hardening of hearts is a recurring theme in the Bible, notably seen in the account of Pharaoh during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>). It suggests that God, in His omniscience and justice, allows or causes certain individuals or groups to resist His will, ultimately fulfilling His divine purposes. This hardening is not arbitrary but serves a greater plan within God's redemptive history.<p><b>to engage Israel in battle</b><br>The engagement in battle was part of the conquest of Canaan, a land promised to the descendants of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The battles were not merely military campaigns but were seen as acts of divine judgment against the Canaanite nations for their idolatry and wickedness (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). This engagement was necessary for Israel to take possession of the land God had given them.<p><b>so that they would be set apart for destruction</b><br>The phrase "set apart for destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," which means devoted to God for destruction. This was a form of divine judgment against the Canaanites, who were seen as irredeemably corrupt. The destruction was meant to prevent the Israelites from being influenced by the Canaanites' idolatrous practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>).<p><b>and would receive no mercy</b><br>This lack of mercy underscores the severity of God's judgment. It reflects the holiness and justice of God, who cannot tolerate sin. The Canaanites had ample time to repent, as evidenced by Rahab's acknowledgment of God's power (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>), but they chose to persist in their ways. This phrase also serves as a warning to Israel to remain faithful to God.<p><b>being annihilated as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>The command to annihilate the Canaanites was given to Moses as part of the instructions for taking possession of the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This command was not based on ethnic superiority but on the moral and spiritual corruption of the Canaanites. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will come upon the world, pointing to the need for repentance and faith in God's provision for salvation through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who orchestrates events according to His divine will and purpose.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, succeeding Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land and executing God's commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanite_kings.htm">The Canaanite Kings</a></b><br>The collective adversaries of Israel, whose hearts were hardened by God to engage in battle against Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, led by Joshua, who are executing God's judgment on the Canaanite nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The former leader of Israel, who received God's commandments regarding the conquest of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God's actions, including the hardening of hearts, are rooted in His sovereign will and perfect justice.

Muller, 'Christian Doctrine of Sin,' 2:412, says that "Scripture never speaks of God's hardening men's hearts, save in connection with His revelations through Moses or Christ." This passage evidently had not occurred to him when writing. His explanation of the difficulty is hardly satisfactory. We are not to suppose that the free will of the Canaanites was in any way interfered with. God no doubt left them to themselves as the due punishment of their iniquities. Sin in general, by God's own appointment, and especially the sensual sins in which the Canaanites were steeped, has a tendency to produce insensibility to moral or even prudential considerations, and to beget a recklessness which urges on the sinner to his ruin. Some have argued that had they all come, like the Gibeonites, as suppliants, they must all have been massacred in cold blood. But this is not likely. Rather we must imagine that God foresaw that they would not believe the signs He would give in favour of the Israelites, and that by meeting them in battle they brought a swift and speedy destruction on themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/11-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1441;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
