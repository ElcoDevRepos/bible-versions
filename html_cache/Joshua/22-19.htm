The Israelites were deeply concerned with ritual purity, and the land's perceived uncleanness could stem from its separation from the main body of Israel and the tabernacle. This reflects the importance of maintaining spiritual purity and unity within the covenant community.<p><b>then cross over to the land of the LORD&#8217;s possession</b><br>The "land of the LORD's possession" refers to the land west of the Jordan River, which was considered the heart of the Promised Land. This invitation underscores the unity and shared inheritance of the tribes of Israel. It also highlights the centrality of the land in God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, emphasizing the importance of being in the place where God&#8217;s presence dwells.<p><b>where the LORD&#8217;s tabernacle stands</b><br>The tabernacle was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. At this time, it was located at Shiloh. The tabernacle's presence signified God's covenant relationship with Israel and was the focal point of religious life. This phrase emphasizes the importance of worshiping according to God's ordained means and the centrality of God's presence in the life of the nation.<p><b>and take possession of it among us</b><br>This invitation for the eastern tribes to settle among the western tribes reflects a desire for unity and shared identity as God's people. It underscores the communal nature of Israel's covenant relationship with God, where the well-being of one tribe affects the whole nation. This reflects the New Testament teaching of the body of Christ, where believers are interconnected and interdependent.<p><b>But do not rebel against the LORD or against us</b><br>Rebellion against the LORD in the Old Testament often involved idolatry or disobedience to God's commands. The concern here is that building an unauthorized altar could lead to idolatry or division. This phrase highlights the seriousness of maintaining fidelity to God's covenant and the dangers of actions that could lead to spiritual apostasy or communal discord.<p><b>by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God</b><br>The altar of the LORD was the designated place for sacrifices and offerings, centralizing worship and ensuring it was conducted according to God's instructions. Building another altar could signify a break from God's commands and the unity of worship. This reflects the biblical principle of worshiping God as He has prescribed, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the true altar and high priest for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

The only satisfactory explanation of this somewhat difficult passage which has yet been given is that of Masius, who explains it of a possible belief on the part of the two and a half tribes, that they were cut off by Jordan into another land, a land which had no title to the promises and privileges of Israel, no share in the worship of the one true God at Shiloh. If they entertained such an idea, then, however unfounded their conviction, it were better far to abandon the land, how suited to their circumstances soever it might be, and come across the Jordan, and dwell in the midst of their brethren, and under the protection of the tabernacle of the Lord. Beside.
