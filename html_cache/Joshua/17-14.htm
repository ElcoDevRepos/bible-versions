This adoption gave Joseph a double portion among the tribes of Israel. Joshua, a member of the tribe of Ephraim, was the leader of Israel at this time, having succeeded Moses. The tribes approach Joshua with a request, indicating their respect for his authority and leadership.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you given us only one portion as an inheritance?</b><br>The complaint arises from the allocation of land in Canaan. The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh were given a significant territory, but they felt it was insufficient for their needs. This reflects the broader context of land distribution among the tribes, which was a complex process involving divine guidance (<a href="/numbers/26-52.htm">Numbers 26:52-56</a>). The "one portion" suggests a perceived inadequacy in the land's capacity to support their population.<p><b>We have many people,</b><br>The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh were indeed populous, fulfilling the blessing Jacob gave to Joseph's sons that they would grow into a multitude (<a href="/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>).

This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience and faithfulness were often rewarded with material and population growth (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>).

They were proud of their numerical preponderance over the remaining tribes. Thus they, and they only, ventured to remonstrate with Joshua about the inadequacy of the portion allotted to them. Such a sensitiveness was likely to degenerate into insolence when the authority of the great leader was removed. And the history of Gideon (<a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1-3</a>) and of Jephthah (<a href="/judges/12-6.htm">Judges 12:6</a>) shows that this was actually the case. Here, again, we have a sign of that deep undercurrent of consistency which underlies our history, and is a guarantee of its authenticity. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing I am a great people.</span> The tribe of Joseph, at the census described in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, outnumbered every tribe but that of Judah. At the census in the plains of Moab (<a href="/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>.) the tribe of Joseph outnumbered them all, though the relative proportions of Ephraim and Manasseh were altered, the latter being now considerably the larger of the two tribes. The whole number of the fighting men of Israel underwent a slight diminution during the passage through the wilderness. But the demand of the tribe of Joseph seems to have been a little unbecoming, since Joseph had obtained <span class="accented">two</span> lots and <span class="accented">two</span> portions, since half the tribe of Manasseh had settled on the east of Jordan. Hence no doubt the covert sarcasm of Joshua's reply, for, as Delitzsch shows, Judah, and even Dan, considerably outnumbered Ephraim and the half tribe of Manasseh. Part, however, of their complaint was no doubt caused by the idea that Joshua, as one of themselves, ought to have taken more care of the interests of his own tribe. Joshua, however, as a true servant of God ought to be, was above such petty considerations, though many who live under a higher dispensation find it impossible to emancipate themselves from such bondage. <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as the Lord hath blessed me hitherto.</span> Or, <span class="accented">hath blessed me to this extent</span> (but see <a href="/exodus/7-16.htm">Exodus 7:16</a>). There is doubtless here an allusion to Jacob's blessing (<a href="/genesis/48-20.htm">Genesis 48:20</a>; <a href="/genesis/44-22.htm">Genesis 44:22-26</a>), the fulfilment of which would naturally make a deep impression on the minds of the children of Joseph. Blessing was the word reiterated over and over again by the dying patriarch as he gazed upon the children of his best-beloved son. Here, again, we have one of those delicate touches, impossible to a writer of fiction, which show that we have here an authentic record of facts. No doubt the consciousness of the enthusiastic language of Jacob, reiterated upon an almost equally solemn occasion by Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-17</a>), coupled with the obvious fulfilment of these predictions, led the tribe of Joseph to demand as a right the leadership in Israel, and no doubt predisposed the other tribes to concede it. The rivalry of Judah, to which reference has already been made, and which culminated in the sovereignty of David, was calculated to produce a beach which it required the utmost tact to heal. Pity it was that the Ephraimites and Manassites forgot the fact that the blessing was conditional, and neglected to lay to heart the terrible warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. But it is too often so with men. They expect the fulfilment of prophecies which predict their aggrandisement, and too often strive themselves to hasten the hand of God, while the warnings of God's Word, since they are less pleasant to the natural man, are permitted to pass by unheeded (see vers. 12, 13, which was the first step on the downward road). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/17-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Joseph</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1428;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;s&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3130.htm">Strong's 3130: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph -- 'he increases', a son of Jacob, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
