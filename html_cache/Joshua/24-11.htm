This event parallels the earlier crossing of the Red Sea, showcasing God's miraculous provision and faithfulness. Jericho, one of the oldest inhabited cities, was strategically located and heavily fortified, representing the first major obstacle in the conquest of Canaan. The crossing signifies a new beginning and the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham regarding the land.<p><b>The people of Jericho fought against you,</b><br>The inhabitants of Jericho, aware of Israel's approach, prepared for battle. Jericho's walls were formidable, and its people were known for their military strength. This resistance highlights the challenge Israel faced in claiming the land. The battle of Jericho is a testament to God's power, as the walls fell not by conventional warfare but through divine intervention, emphasizing reliance on God rather than human strength.<p><b>as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites,</b><br>These groups represent the various nations inhabiting Canaan, each with distinct cultures and practices. The Amorites and Canaanites were particularly prominent, often symbolizing the sinful practices God warned Israel against. The mention of these nations underscores the comprehensive nature of the conquest and the fulfillment of God's command to drive out the inhabitants due to their idolatry and immorality. This also foreshadows the ongoing struggle Israel would face in maintaining purity and faithfulness amidst surrounding pagan influences.<p><b>and I delivered them into your hand.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and active role in Israel's victories. The deliverance of these nations into Israel's hands was not due to Israel's might but God's intervention. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God fighting for His people and fulfilling His promises. It also serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to divine blessing and success. This deliverance is a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, securing spiritual freedom for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, led by Joshua, who crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical boundary that the Israelites crossed to enter Canaan, symbolizing a transition from the wilderness to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>The first city in Canaan that the Israelites conquered, known for its fortified walls.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amorites,_perizzites,_canaanites,_hittites,_girgashites,_hivites,_and_jebusites.htm">The Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites</a></b><br>Various groups of people inhabiting Canaan, representing the opposition to Israel's settlement in the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>The divine intervention by which God gave victory to the Israelites over their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God fulfills His promises.
