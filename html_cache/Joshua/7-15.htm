In the context of <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, Achan is the one who took such items from Jericho, which were meant to be destroyed or dedicated to the Lord. This act of taking the devoted things violated God's command and brought sin upon Israel. The concept of "herem" is significant in the Old Testament, as it represents total consecration to God, often through destruction, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>.<p><b>must be burned, along with all that belongs to him</b><br>The punishment of burning indicates the severity of the sin and the need for complete removal of the impurity from the community. This reflects the holiness code found in Leviticus, where certain sins required severe penalties to maintain the purity of the people. The burning of Achan and his possessions symbolizes the eradication of sin and its consequences from Israel. This act also serves as a deterrent to others, emphasizing the seriousness of disobedience to God's commands.<p><b>because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD</b><br>Transgressing the covenant refers to breaking the solemn agreement between God and Israel. The covenant was a binding relationship, with blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. Achan's sin was not just a personal failure but a breach of the communal relationship with God, affecting the entire nation. This highlights the corporate nature of sin and its impact on the community, a theme also seen in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>.<p><b>and committed an outrage in Israel.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The term "outrage" underscores the gravity of Achan's sin, which was not only a violation of divine command but also a moral affront to the community. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, communal identity and honor were paramount, and Achan's actions brought shame and danger to the entire nation. This concept of communal responsibility and the need for purity is echoed in the New Testament, where the church is called to be holy and blameless, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achan.htm">Achan</a></b><br>The individual who sinned by taking the devoted things, causing Israel to suffer defeat at Ai.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ai.htm">Ai</a></b><br>The city where Israel faced defeat due to Achan's sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devoted_things.htm">The Devoted Things</a></b><br>Items that were to be destroyed or dedicated to the Lord, taken by Achan in disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant_of_the_lord.htm">The Covenant of the LORD</a></b><br>The sacred agreement between God and Israel, which Achan violated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Achan's sin shows that disobedience to God has severe consequences, not just for the individual but for the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commands is crucial for maintaining a right relationship with Him and ensuring His blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The sin of one can affect the entire community, highlighting the need for accountability and integrity within the body of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_justice.htm">God's Holiness and Justice</a></b><br>God's response to Achan's sin underscores His holiness and the necessity of justice in dealing with sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>While Achan's account ends in judgment, it serves as a reminder of the need for repentance and the possibility of restoration through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_7_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 7:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_7_15_Sin_s_gravity_to_God.htm">How does Joshua 7:15 illustrate the seriousness of sin in God's eyes?
