It echoes God's command to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6-7</a>, where strength and courage are prerequisites for leadership and obedience to God's commands. The call to be strong is not merely physical but spiritual, requiring reliance on God's power and presence.<p><b>so that you can keep and obey</b><br>The emphasis here is on the active role of the Israelites in maintaining their covenant relationship with God. "Keep" implies guarding or preserving the commandments, while "obey" suggests a proactive adherence to God's laws. This dual action is essential for the Israelites to remain in God's favor and continue to receive His blessings.<p><b>all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses,</b><br>The "Book of the Law of Moses" refers to the Torah, particularly the first five books of the Old Testament. This underscores the importance of Scripture as the foundation of Israel's faith and practice. The Law of Moses was central to the identity and religious life of Israel, providing guidelines for worship, social justice, and personal conduct. It also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who fulfills the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>not turning aside from it to the right or to the left.</b><br>This phrase signifies the importance of unwavering commitment to God's commandments. It suggests a straight path of obedience, avoiding deviations that could lead to idolatry or moral compromise. This imagery is consistent with <a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a> and <a href="/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>, which also warn against straying from God's path. The call to not turn aside reflects the need for focus and dedication in following God's will, a principle that is timeless and applicable to believers today.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who is delivering his farewell address to the Israelites, urging them to remain faithful to God's law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have settled in the Promised Land and are being reminded of their covenant obligations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/book_of_the_law_of_moses.htm">Book of the Law of Moses</a></b><br>Refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain God's commandments and instructions for His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The solemn agreement between God and Israel, where God promises blessings for obedience and warns of consequences for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/strength_in_obedience.htm">Strength in Obedience</a></b><br>Joshua emphasizes the need for strength and courage to obey God's law.

Strength here is not brute force but spiritual resilience. God had spoken the same words to Joshua decades earlier&#8212;&#8220;Be strong and courageous&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6&#8211;7</a>)&#8212;and that call never expires. Paul later echoes it: &#8220;Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>). Real strength flows from confidence that the Lord &#8220;will never leave you nor forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>).<p>Key ideas:<p>&#8226; Strength is rooted in God&#8217;s presence, not self-reliance.<p>&#8226; Courage is needed just as much in peace as in warfare, because complacency erodes faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you can keep</b><p>Strength has a purpose: perseverance in faithfulness. &#8220;Keep&#8221; carries the sense of guarding a treasure (see <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). Jesus said, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). James adds, &#8220;Be doers of the word and not hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). God supplies power so His people can watch over His word in their hearts and lives.<p>Highlights:<p>&#8226; Spiritual muscles are exercised by day-to-day obedience.<p>&#8226; The goal is not simply knowing Scripture but treasuring it enough to protect it from neglect.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses</b><p>Partial obedience was never an option. Moses had warned, &#8220;You shall not add to the word I command you, nor take from it&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>). Jesus affirmed every &#8220;jot or tittle&#8221; of the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17&#8211;18</a>). Paul reminds Timothy that &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). Joshua urges comprehensive submission&#8212;every command, precept, and promise matters.<p>Takeaways:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word is complete; we do not edit His authority.<p>&#8226; Reverence for Scripture demands both hearing and doing&#8212;all &#8220;is written&#8221; applies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not turning aside from it to the right or to the left</b><p>The picture is a narrow path bordered by danger on both sides. Moses used the same phrase (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>); Solomon echoed it&#8212;&#8220;Do not turn to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>). <a href="/hebrews/12-13.htm">Hebrews 12:13</a> picks up the imagery: &#8220;Make straight paths for your feet.&#8221; The directive guards against drift, distraction, and distortion.<p>Bullet points:<p>&#8226; Right or left deviations may look different&#8212;legalism on one side, license on the other&#8212;but both miss God&#8217;s way.<p>&#8226; Steadiness requires daily recalibration to Scripture, refusing cultural or personal detours.<p>&#8226; The Holy Spirit empowers believers to stay centered (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/23-6.htm">Joshua 23:6</a> calls God&#8217;s people to unwavering strength that fuels wholehearted obedience. The verse stitches together courage, vigilance, comprehensive allegiance to Scripture, and steady course correction.
