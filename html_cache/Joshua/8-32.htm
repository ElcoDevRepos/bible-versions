The Israelites were gathered to witness the inscribing of the law, highlighting the communal aspect of their covenant with God. This public act ensured transparency and accountability, reinforcing the collective responsibility of the people to uphold the law. It mirrors the earlier covenant renewal ceremonies, such as the one at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-24), where the law was given in the presence of the entire nation.<p><b>Joshua inscribed on the stones</b><br>The act of inscribing the law on stones signifies permanence and durability, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's commandments. This practice of writing on stones was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures for important decrees and treaties. The use of stones also connects to the earlier command in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-2.htm">Deuteronomy 27:2-3</a>, where Moses instructed the Israelites to set up large stones and coat them with plaster to write the law upon entering the Promised Land.<p><b>a copy of the law of Moses</b><br>This refers to the Torah, particularly the commandments and statutes given to Moses on Mount Sinai. The law served as the foundation of Israel's covenant relationship with God, guiding their moral, social, and religious life. By inscribing a copy, Joshua was reaffirming the centrality of the law in the life of the nation. This act also prefigures the New Covenant, where the law is written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>which he had written</b><br>This phrase indicates that Joshua was following the instructions given by Moses, who had written down the law as commanded by God (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>).

"The wall destined to receive the picture," and it was just the same with inscriptions - was covered with a coating of lime and gypsum plaster. The outline was then sketched with red chalk, and afterwards corrected and filled in with black (Keurick's 'Egypt,' 1, p. 271). Thomson ('Land and the Book,' Io. 471) says that he has seen writings in plaster which could not have been less than two thousand years old. This passage shows that our author had <a href="/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2, 3</a> in his mind. The stones of the altar, which alone have been mentioned, are clearly not meant here, but the erection of plastered stone on which the law was to be written. <span class="cmt_word">A copy of the law of Moses,</span> "Deuteronomium legis," Vulgate.

It is to be observed that the word is definite, the copy, not a copy, of the law. This (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>) was what was written on the two tables of stone, which (<a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>, 31:18) God gave to Moses. Yet it is possible that, as some commentaters suggest, and as ver. 34 may be held to imply, what is meant is the curses and blessings mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>, and 28. The formal setting up of this memorial was intended to remind the Israelites, by a perpetual standing witness, of the conditions on which they held the land of Canaan. And it is to be observed that the moral, rather than the positive, precepts of the law were thus solemnly enjoined on them, since neglect of the moral law of God is the invariable source of national degradation and decay. <span class="cmt_word">Which he wrote.</span> Namely, Joshua. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/8-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the presence</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
