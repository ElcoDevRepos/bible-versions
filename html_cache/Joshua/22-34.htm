This altar, named "Witness," was built as a symbol of unity and shared faith with the tribes on the western side. The naming of the altar reflects a common biblical practice where names are given to places or objects to signify their purpose or commemorate an event (e.g., <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>, where Jacob names Bethel). The altar was not for sacrifices but served as a reminder of their shared worship of Yahweh, despite geographical separation.<p><b>for they said, &#8220;It is a witness between us</b><br>The altar served as a testimony to the unity of the tribes of Israel, despite the physical barrier of the Jordan River. This phrase emphasizes the importance of maintaining spiritual unity and accountability among God's people. The concept of a "witness" is significant in biblical law and covenant-making, where witnesses serve to confirm agreements and ensure faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The altar was a tangible reminder of their commitment to the covenant with God and each other.<p><b>that the LORD is God.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration affirms the central tenet of Israel's faith: the acknowledgment of Yahweh as the one true God. It echoes the Shema, a foundational statement of faith in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." The altar as a witness underscores the tribes' dedication to worshiping Yahweh alone, rejecting idolatry, and maintaining their identity as His chosen people. This statement also prefigures the New Testament emphasis on unity in Christ, where believers are called to be one in faith and purpose (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites_and_gadites.htm">Reubenites and Gadites</a></b><br>These are two of the tribes of Israel who settled on the east side of the Jordan River.

The river symbolizes both division and connection in the context of the altar's purpose.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas.htm">Phinehas</a></b><br>The son of Eleazar the priest, Phinehas was sent to investigate the altar's construction. His involvement underscores the importance of maintaining religious purity and unity among the tribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>Central to the account, the LORD is the God whom the altar is meant to honor and serve as a witness to His covenant with all the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The altar serves as a reminder that physical separation does not equate to spiritual division.

This word is not in the original. It is found in some late MSS. and in the Syriac and Arabic versions, but not in the LXX. or Chaldee. Even in the MSS. which have it, the word is found sometimes before and sometimes after the Hebrew word signifying "altar." This may either be because, once omitted, it was conjecturally supplied, but it is more probable that it was never there at all. The passage may be rendered, "And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad gave a name to the altar, 'for it is a witness between us.'" But it seems more likely that the word "Ed," though not expressed, is in. tended to be understood. The LXX. and Vulgate give incorrect renderings of the passage. The Lord is God. Rather, as in <a href="/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>, Jehovah is the God; that is, the one true God.
