The Amorites were a powerful group in Canaan, often representing opposition to God's people. Sihon's defeat is a testament to God's promise to give Israel victory over their enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-36</a>). This event is frequently referenced in Scripture as a demonstration of God's faithfulness and power (<a href="/psalms/135-11.htm">Psalm 135:11</a>).<p><b>who lived in Heshbon</b><br>Heshbon was the capital city of Sihon's kingdom. It was strategically located east of the Jordan River and served as a central hub for the Amorites. The city's capture by the Israelites is significant as it symbolizes the transfer of power and the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Heshbon later became part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Reuben (<a href="/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>).<p><b>He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley</b><br>Aroer was a city located on the northern edge of the Arnon Valley, marking the southern boundary of Sihon's kingdom. The Arnon River served as a natural border between Moab and the Amorite territory. This geographical detail underscores the extent of Sihon's domain and the strategic importance of controlling such a region. The mention of Aroer highlights the comprehensive nature of Israel's conquest.<p><b>along the middle of the valley</b><br>The middle of the Arnon Valley indicates the central part of this significant geographical feature. The valley itself was a critical area for trade and military movements, making it a valuable asset for any ruling power. By controlling the middle of the valley, Sihon had significant influence over the region, which was later transferred to Israel.<p><b>up to the Jabbok River (the border of the Ammonites)</b><br>The Jabbok River served as the northern boundary of Sihon's kingdom, separating it from the territory of the Ammonites. This river is historically significant as the site where Jacob wrestled with God and was renamed Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22-32</a>). The mention of the Jabbok River emphasizes the extent of the land conquered by Israel and the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>that is, half of Gilead</b><br>Gilead was a fertile and strategically important region east of the Jordan River. The reference to "half of Gilead" indicates the division of this territory between the Amorites and the Ammonites. Gilead later became part of the inheritance for the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39-40</a>). The conquest of Gilead by Israel is a testament to God's provision and the establishment of His people in the land He promised.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon,_king_of_the_amorites.htm">Sihon, King of the Amorites</a></b><br>Sihon was a powerful Amorite king who ruled over a significant territory east of the Jordan River.
