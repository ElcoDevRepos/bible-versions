In ancient Israel, storytelling was a primary means of preserving history and teaching faith. This command ensures that the miraculous event is not forgotten and highlights the role of parents and leaders in educating the next generation about God's faithfulness.<p><b>&#8216;The waters of the Jordan were cut off</b><br>The cutting off of the Jordan's waters is a miraculous event that parallels the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). This miracle signifies God's continued presence and power among the Israelites as they enter the Promised Land. The Jordan River, typically a formidable barrier, especially during harvest season when it overflows its banks (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>), becomes a symbol of God's ability to overcome obstacles for His people.<p><b>before the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant represents God's presence and His covenant with Israel. Its central role in this event underscores the idea that it is God who leads and provides for His people. The Ark going before the Israelites into the Jordan signifies divine leadership and protection, reminding them of God's promises and His holiness.<p><b>When it crossed the Jordan,</b><br>The crossing of the Jordan marks a significant transition for the Israelites, from wandering in the wilderness to entering the land promised to their ancestors. This event fulfills God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) and serves as a tangible sign of His faithfulness. It also represents a new beginning and a call to trust in God's guidance.<p><b>the waters were cut off.&#8217;</b><br>The repetition of the miracle's description emphasizes its significance and ensures that the event is clearly understood and remembered. This miraculous act serves as a testament to God's power and His ability to control nature, reinforcing the Israelites' faith in Him.<p><b>Therefore these stones will be a memorial</b><br>The stones taken from the Jordan and set up at Gilgal serve as a physical reminder of God's miraculous intervention. Memorials in ancient cultures were common ways to commemorate significant events. These stones are intended to provoke questions from future generations, leading to the retelling of God's mighty acts.<p><b>to the Israelites forever.&#8221;</b><br>The use of "forever" indicates the perpetual nature of this memorial. It is meant to be an enduring reminder of God's faithfulness and power. This concept of a lasting memorial is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>) and the Lord's Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24-25</a>), which also serve as perpetual reminders of God's salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The body of water that the Israelites miraculously crossed on dry ground.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that represented the presence of God among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/memorial_stones.htm">Memorial Stones</a></b><br>Twelve stones taken from the Jordan River to serve as a lasting memorial of God's miraculous intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>God commands the Israelites to set up memorial stones to remember His faithfulness.

God intends every generation to hear how He acted. Similar instructions appear in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-20.htm">Deuteronomy 6:20-21</a>, where parents are told to recount the Exodus, and in <a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>, which urges us &#8220;not to hide them from their children.&#8221; The pattern is simple:<p>&#8226; Remember what God did.<p>&#8226; Retell it so faith is sparked in those who come next.<p>By embedding history in conversation, Israel would never be allowed to lapse into spiritual amnesia.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The waters of the Jordan were cut off</b><p>God repeats His Red Sea wonder, but this time at the Jordan. <a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a> records that &#8220;the waters flowing downstream stood still and rose up in a heap.&#8221; It was not a seasonal ebb but a supernatural stoppage, underlining:<p>&#8226; He rules creation (<a href="/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; He makes impossible barriers passable (<a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>).<p>Thus the text stresses the literal cutting off of water&#8212;a factual, observable event designed to anchor Israel&#8217;s confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before the ark of the covenant of the LORD</b><p>The ark symbolized God&#8217;s throne among His people (<a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33-36</a>). Placing it at the river&#8217;s edge made a statement:<p>&#8226; Where God leads, obstacles retreat.<p>&#8226; Holiness goes first; the nation follows.<p>Later, when Israel treated the ark as a lucky charm instead of a holy presence (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3-11</a>), defeat followed. <a href="/bsb/joshua/4.htm">Joshua 4</a> reminds us the ark&#8217;s power lies in the Lord who sits enthroned above it (<a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When it crossed the Jordan</b><p>Timing matters. The waters stayed parted only &#8220;when&#8221; the ark entered and remained so &#8220;when&#8221; it crossed. Faith required Israel to step in while the river still ran (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15-16</a>). Like the priests:<p>&#8226; We obey first, then see the miracle (<a href="/hebrews/11-29.htm">Hebrews 11:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Our risks rest on God&#8217;s reliability, not on visible guarantees.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Therefore these stones</b><p>Twelve stones, one per tribe, were taken from the dry riverbed (<a href="/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3</a>). Physical objects helped seal spiritual memory. Think of Jacob&#8217;s stone at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18-22</a>) or Samuel&#8217;s Ebenezer stone (<a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>).
