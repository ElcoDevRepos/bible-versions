He was Moses' assistant and successor, chosen by God to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. His leadership marks a transition from the wilderness wanderings to the conquest of Canaan. Joshua's name, meaning "The Lord is salvation," is significant as it foreshadows Jesus Christ, whose name in Hebrew is Yeshua, the same as Joshua. This typology highlights Joshua as a precursor to Christ, leading God's people into their inheritance.<br><br>*commanded*<br>The act of commanding indicates Joshua's authority and the beginning of his active leadership role. This command is a direct response to God's earlier instructions to Joshua to be strong and courageous (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6-9</a>). It reflects his obedience and readiness to fulfill God's promises to Israel. The use of command also underscores the military and organizational structure necessary for the upcoming conquest of Canaan.<br><br>*the officers of the people*<br>The officers were likely tribal leaders or elders who held positions of authority among the Israelites. They were responsible for communicating Joshua's orders to the people, ensuring that the instructions were followed. This hierarchical structure was essential for maintaining order and unity among the large group of Israelites. It reflects the organized nature of Israelite society, which was necessary for the successful conquest and settlement of the Promised Land. The role of these officers can be compared to the New Testament concept of church leadership, where leaders are tasked with guiding and instructing the congregation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the leader of the Israelites following Moses' death.

We may compare this event, in its relation to Joshua, with the giving of the law from Sinai to Moses. Both were preceded by a three days' notice and a sanctification of the people. Both were means employed by God to establish the leaders whom He had chosen in the position which He designed for them. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/19-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever.

Different ideas have been entertained of their duties. Keil, Jahn (<span class="accented">Hebrew Commonwealth</span>), and others believe that they were genealogists; but it seems more probable that their original duties were to keep processes and minutes, and that, like our Indian "writers" and the "Master of the Rolls" at home, they exercised some kind of judicial functions, with which, moreover, active duties were sometimes combined. The idea that they were genealogists is contrary, as Gesenius shows, to the context in many places. Thus in <a href="/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6-19</a>, they seem to have had to see that the specified tale of bricks was delivered up; and we know from the recently deciphered Egyptian inscriptions that very accurate registers of such matters were kept. In <a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16</a> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>; <a href="/joshua/23-2.htm">Joshua 23:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>, etc.) they appear to have exercised judicial functions in connection with the <span class="accented">"princes"</span> (not <span class="accented">"captains,"</span> as in our version, which would lead to the idea that they were military officers). In <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> they are connected with the elders. In <a href="/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a> they seem again to have exercised judicial functions, whereas in <a href="/2_chronicles/26-11.htm">2 Chronicles 26:11</a> their duty appears to have been to keep the muster rolls. In <a href="/proverbs/6-7.htm">Proverbs 6:7</a> we find them once more with active duties as in the text. The LXX. equivalent; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, is rendered in <a href="/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a> by "town clerk," an officer with active as well as merely secretarial duties. Here they seem to have acted as officers of the commissariat, civil and military functions being naturally largely interchangeable in the then condition of the Israelitish people, just as they were in the early days of our Indian empire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1428;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1443;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7779;aw)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the officers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1496;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;&#7789;&#601;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7860.htm">Strong's 7860: </a> </span><span class="str2">A scribe, an official superintendent, magistrate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the people:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/1-10.htm">OT History: Joshua 1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers (Josh.
