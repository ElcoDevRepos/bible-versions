The burning of the city signifies total judgment and the fulfillment of God's command to devote the city to destruction (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). This act of burning is consistent with the ancient Near Eastern practice of herem, or the devotion of things to destruction as an offering to a deity. The destruction of Jericho serves as a warning to other Canaanite cities and demonstrates God's power and faithfulness to Israel. It also prefigures the final judgment and the ultimate victory of God's people over evil.<p><b>However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD&#8217;s house.</b><br>This phrase highlights the distinction between what was to be destroyed and what was to be consecrated to God. The valuable metals were spared from destruction and dedicated to the LORD, signifying that the firstfruits of the conquest belonged to Him. This act of dedication is reminiscent of the principle of firstfruits found in the Law (<a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>), where the first and best are given to God. The treasury of the LORD's house refers to the tabernacle, the central place of worship for Israel at the time. This dedication underscores the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty and provision. It also foreshadows the temple treasury, which would later play a significant role in Israel's worship and economy. The act of setting apart these metals can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate treasure and offering to God, consecrated for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Joshua, who are executing God's command to conquer Jericho.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>A fortified city in the Promised Land, representing the first major conquest for the Israelites under Joshua's leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/treasury_of_the_lord's_house.htm">Treasury of the LORD&#8217;s house</a></b><br>The designated place for storing valuable items dedicated to God, signifying the importance of honoring God with the first fruits of victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' actions demonstrate the importance of complete obedience to God's instructions, even when it involves destruction or sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dedication_of_first_fruits.htm">Dedication of First Fruits</a></b><br>The act of placing valuable items in the treasury signifies the principle of dedicating the first fruits of our labor to God, acknowledging His provision and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_victory.htm">God's Sovereignty in Victory</a></b><br>The conquest of Jericho illustrates that victory comes from the Lord, and our response should be to honor Him with the spoils of our success.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The destruction of Jericho and the dedication of valuables to God highlight the call to holiness and separation from worldly possessions and influences.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_6_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 6:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_6_24_Obedience_to_God_s_orders.htm">How does Joshua 6:24 demonstrate obedience to God's specific instructions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_God_s_justice_in_Joshua_6_24.htm">What can we learn about God's justice from the destruction in Joshua 6:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Joshua_6_24_to_Deut_7_2_promises.htm">How does Joshua 6:24 connect to God's promises in Deuteronomy 7:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Joshua_6_24_s_obedience_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of complete obedience from Joshua 6:24 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_city_burning_in_Joshua_6_24.htm">What does the burning of the city in Joshua 6:24 symbolize for believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_destroy_Jericho_in_Joshua_6_2.htm">Why did God command the destruction of Jericho in Joshua 6:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_6_24_and_a_loving_God.htm">How does Joshua 6:24 align with the concept of a loving God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Joshua_6_24_events.htm">What archaeological evidence supports the events described in Joshua 6:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_achan's_sin_cause_israel's_loss.htm">Why did Achan's disobedience lead to Israel's defeat?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_jericho's_fall_differ_in_joshua_6.htm">Why does the destruction narrative of Jericho differ from other historical records about the city&#8217;s downfall (Joshua 6)? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_dove_droppings_worth_5_shekels.htm">Who was Achan and what were the accursed things?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_was_the_curse_of_jericho.htm">What was the Curse of Jericho?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Joshua 6:24 Mean</div><b>Then the Israelites burned up the city</b><p>&#8220;Then the Israelites burned up the city&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/6-24.htm">Joshua 6:24</a>).<p>&#8226; God had told Joshua, &#8220;The city and everything in it are devoted to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). Following through with fire showed literal obedience to that command, much like Moses had instructed Israel to &#8220;destroy completely&#8221; the pagan strongholds of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>; 20:16-18).<p>&#8226; The flames made a visible declaration that Jericho belonged to the LORD for judgment, comparable to Elijah&#8217;s altar that was consumed by fire to prove God&#8217;s ownership (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>).<p>&#8226; By burning Jericho, Israel confirmed that victory was not for their enrichment but for God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and everything in it</b><p>&#8220;and everything in it&#8221; (v. 24b).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores the totality of the ban&#8212;nothing living, valuable, or trivial escaped destruction (cf. <a href="/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors the command Saul failed to obey regarding Amalek (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3, 9</a>). Where Saul spared choice plunder, Israel here obeyed fully, illustrating the blessing tied to complete obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Such thoroughness warned Israel against later idolatry; anything left alive or intact could tempt them (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron</b><p>&#8220;However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron&#8221; (v. 24c).<p>&#8226; God had pre-assigned these metals for Himself (<a href="/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18-19</a>). They were considered holy, like the firstfruits He claimed in <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a> and <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>.<p>&#8226; Setting apart precious metals foreshadowed later temple treasures gathered by David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-11.htm">2 Samuel 8:11</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-11.htm">1 Chronicles 18:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast&#8212;burning everything else yet preserving these metals&#8212;shows the difference between cursed objects and consecrated ones (<a href="/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the treasury of the LORD&#8217;s house</b><p>&#8220;into the treasury of the LORD&#8217;s house&#8221; (v. 24d).<p>&#8226; Even before a permanent temple existed, Israel maintained a dedicated store for worship (<a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Depositing the metals signaled that victory resources belong to God first; only afterward can His people enjoy their inheritance (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-12.htm">2 Chronicles 31:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This act set a precedent later echoed when Hezekiah and Josiah restored temple treasuries (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-11.htm">2 Chronicles 31:11-12</a>; 34:9), and ultimately points forward to believers laying up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/6-24.htm">Joshua 6:24</a> shows Israel&#8217;s wholehearted obedience&#8212;destroying Jericho exactly as commanded while dedicating every valuable metal to God&#8217;s treasury. The verse teaches that victory, possessions, and future security all belong to the LORD. When His people honor Him first, they testify to His holiness and safeguard themselves from idolatry and pride.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/6-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [the Israelites] burned up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8313.htm">Strong's 8313: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be, on fire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
