The spies, sent by Joshua, represent the Israelite mission to scout the land of Canaan, specifically Jericho. The timing here is significant, as it occurs under the cover of night, symbolizing secrecy and urgency. The act of laying down suggests a temporary rest, indicating the spies' vulnerability and reliance on God's protection. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God provides safety and guidance during times of uncertainty, such as the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.<p><b>Rahab went up on the roof</b><br>Rahab's actions demonstrate her initiative and courage. In ancient Near Eastern culture, roofs were often flat and used for various purposes, including drying flax, which Rahab had done earlier. Her decision to go up on the roof signifies her proactive role in the unfolding events. Rahab, a Canaanite and a prostitute, is an unlikely ally for the Israelites, yet her faith and actions align her with God's purposes. This moment foreshadows her inclusion in the lineage of Jesus Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>, highlighting God's grace and the inclusion of Gentiles in His redemptive plan. Rahab's faith is later commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a> and <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>, underscoring her role as a model of faith and works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho, known for her occupation as a prostitute.
