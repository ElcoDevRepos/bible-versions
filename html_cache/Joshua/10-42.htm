The LORD, Yahweh, is identified as the God of Israel, highlighting the covenant relationship established with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This divine assistance is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God fights on behalf of His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a> during the crossing of the Red Sea. The phrase underscores the belief that Israel's victories are not due to their own strength but because of God's direct involvement. This reflects the theological perspective that God is sovereign and actively involved in the affairs of His chosen people.<p><b>Joshua captured all these kings and their land</b><br>Joshua's military campaign is marked by the capture of multiple kings and their territories, demonstrating the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the Israelites. This conquest is part of the larger narrative of the Israelites taking possession of the Promised Land, as outlined in the covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The capture of these kings signifies the defeat of the Canaanite city-states, which were often ruled by local kings. Archaeological evidence from the Late Bronze Age supports the existence of such city-states in Canaan. The phrase also highlights Joshua's role as a leader and military commander, prefiguring Christ as a conqueror over spiritual enemies.<p><b>in one campaign</b><br>The phrase "in one campaign" indicates the swift and decisive nature of Joshua's conquests. This rapid success is attributed to divine intervention, as the LORD fought for Israel. The campaign's efficiency contrasts with the prolonged struggles often faced by ancient armies, emphasizing the miraculous nature of Israel's victories. This swift conquest can be seen as a type of the ultimate victory of Christ, who will decisively defeat all His enemies at His second coming. The phrase also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, as the land was conquered according to His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.

Other historians are content to note the secondary causes. The Scriptures trace all to their original source - the will of God. And it is His will, as the page of history shows, with exceptions that do but prove the rule, that a just cause, assisted by bravery., purity, and devotion combined, will not fail, in the long run, to overcome force and fraud. Wars of independence, wars undertaken to chastise wickedness and oppression, seldom fail in their object. And when they do fail, it is generally from the presence of similar crimes among those who undertake the righteous cause, and sully it by their own vices and crimes. History furnishes us with abundant instances of this. The leaders of the struggle for the Protestant Reformation in Europe were often almost as crafty, as ambitious, as self seeking, as immoral, as those against whom they contended. Struggles patriotic in their origin have been marred by the selfish aims of those who carried them on. Selfishness inspires distrust, and distrust produces disunion. But where "the Lord God fights for Israel," where noble objects are pursued by worthy means, there is a moral strength which triumphs over the greatest obstacles. Such an instance we have in modern history in the career of a man like William the Silent. Nearly ruined by the cowardice, obstinacy, and selfishness of his associates, his faith, courage, and perseverance carried a struggle hopeless at the outset to a triumphant conclusion. Men may cry that "Providence is on the side of the big battalions," but "the Lord's hand is not waxen short." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(nil&#183;&#7717;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3898.htm">Strong's 3898: </a> </span><span class="str2">To feed on, to consume, to battle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
