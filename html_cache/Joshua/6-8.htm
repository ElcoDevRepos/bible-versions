This highlights the importance of leadership and obedience in fulfilling God's plans. Joshua's role as a mediator between God and the Israelites is reminiscent of Moses, emphasizing continuity in leadership and divine guidance.<p><b>seven priests carrying seven rams&#8217; horns</b><br>The number seven is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or perfection. The use of seven priests and seven horns underscores the divine orchestration of events. Rams' horns, or shofars, were used in various religious and military contexts in ancient Israel, signifying both worship and warfare. This dual purpose reflects the spiritual and physical dimensions of the battle for Jericho.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates that the actions of the priests and the people are conducted in the presence of God, emphasizing the sacred nature of the event. It underscores the belief that God is actively involved in the affairs of His people, guiding and empowering them.<p><b>advanced and blew the horns</b><br>The blowing of the horns serves as a signal of both divine presence and impending action. In the context of Jericho, it marks the beginning of God's intervention in the battle. The sound of the shofar is also associated with the proclamation of God's sovereignty and the call to worship, linking the military action with spiritual significance.<p><b>and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant represents God's presence among His people. Its position following the priests signifies that God is leading the charge against Jericho. The Ark's presence assures the Israelites of divine support and protection. This mirrors the role of the Ark in other biblical narratives, where it symbolizes God's covenant and faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.
