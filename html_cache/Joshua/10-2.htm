His name means "Lord of Righteousness," which is ironic given his opposition to God's people. The alarm among Adoni-zedek and his people reflects the fear that spread among the Canaanite kings as they realized the power of Israel's God, especially after the miraculous victories at Jericho and Ai. This fear is reminiscent of Rahab's words in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where she acknowledges the terror that had fallen on the inhabitants of the land.<p><b>because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities</b><br>Gibeon was strategically significant, both in size and location. It was considered a royal city, indicating its importance and influence in the region. The comparison to royal cities suggests that Gibeon had a level of autonomy and power, possibly with its own king or ruling council. This status made its alliance with Israel particularly alarming to the surrounding Canaanite kings, as it shifted the balance of power in the region.<p><b>it was larger than Ai</b><br>The mention of Ai provides a point of reference for the reader, as Ai was a city that had already been conquered by Israel. The fact that Gibeon was larger than Ai emphasizes the significance of its alliance with Israel. This comparison highlights the strategic advantage gained by Israel through this alliance, as Gibeon's size and resources would have bolstered Israel's position in the land.<p><b>and all its men were mighty</b><br>The description of Gibeon's men as mighty indicates that they were known for their strength and military prowess. This further underscores the threat perceived by Adoni-zedek and the other Canaanite kings. The might of Gibeon's warriors would have been a valuable asset to Israel, making their alliance even more formidable. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual integration of Gibeon into Israel, as seen in <a href="/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>, where the Gibeonites become servants to the Israelites, contributing their strength to Israel's cause.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adoni-zedek.htm">Adoni-Zedek</a></b><br>The king of Jerusalem who was alarmed by the alliance between Gibeon and Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>A significant city, described as important and mighty, which made a peace treaty with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ai.htm">Ai</a></b><br>A city previously conquered by Israel, used as a comparison to highlight Gibeon's importance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Joshua, who had entered into a covenant with Gibeon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_men_of_gibeon.htm">Mighty Men of Gibeon</a></b><br>The warriors of Gibeon, noted for their strength and valor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_alliances.htm">The Importance of Alliances</a></b><br>Alliances can bring both protection and challenges.
