Their mother was Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Jacob, their grandfather, adopted them as his own sons, giving them equal status with his other sons (<a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>). This adoption effectively elevated them to the status of tribal patriarchs, each receiving a portion of the inheritance in the Promised Land. Ephraim and Manasseh are often mentioned together, reflecting their close relationship and shared heritage. The tribe of Ephraim would later become one of the most prominent tribes in Israel, often representing the northern kingdom.<p><b>the sons of Joseph,</b><br>Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, played a crucial role in the history of Israel. Sold into slavery by his brothers, he rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt. His wisdom and leadership during a time of famine saved not only Egypt but also his own family, who came to live in Egypt. Joseph's faithfulness and integrity are celebrated throughout the biblical narrative. The blessing of his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, by Jacob, was a significant moment, as it ensured Joseph's legacy would continue through them. Joseph's life is often seen as a type of Christ, with parallels in suffering, exaltation, and salvation.<p><b>received their inheritance.</b><br>The inheritance of Ephraim and Manasseh was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land of Canaan. The division of the land among the tribes of Israel was a significant event, marking the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to settlement in the Promised Land. The allocation of land to Ephraim and Manasseh is detailed in <a href="/joshua/16.htm">Joshua 16 and 17</a>. Ephraim's territory was centrally located, while Manasseh's was divided, with portions on both sides of the Jordan River. This inheritance was not just a physical possession but also a spiritual legacy, as it represented God's faithfulness to His covenant promises. The land was to be a place where the Israelites could live in obedience to God and serve as a light to the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.
