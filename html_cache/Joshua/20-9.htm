They served as a sanctuary for those who committed manslaughter unintentionally. This provision was not only for the Israelites but also extended to foreigners residing among them, reflecting God's justice and mercy. The inclusion of foreigners highlights the universality of God's law and His concern for justice for all people, not just His chosen nation. This inclusivity foreshadows the New Testament message of salvation being available to all nations through Christ.<p><b>so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there</b><br>The concept of unintentional killing, or manslaughter, is distinguished from premeditated murder in the Mosaic Law. The cities of refuge provided a safe haven for those who accidentally caused a death, protecting them from immediate retribution. This reflects the biblical principle of justice tempered with mercy. The provision for refuge underscores the importance of intent in God's law, a theme that is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the heart's intentions over mere actions.<p><b>and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood</b><br>The "avenger of blood" was typically a close relative of the deceased, responsible for ensuring justice by avenging the death. This practice was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures and was a way to maintain family honor and societal order. However, the cities of refuge provided a legal and humane alternative to the cycle of vengeance, allowing for due process. This system points to the need for a mediator, a role ultimately fulfilled by Christ, who intercedes on behalf of sinners.<p><b>prior to standing trial before the assembly</b><br>The requirement for a trial before the assembly ensured that justice was served fairly and that the accused had the opportunity to present their case. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and the importance of community involvement in legal matters. The assembly, likely composed of elders and leaders, acted as judges to determine the intent and circumstances of the killing. This process prefigures the final judgment, where Christ will judge all humanity with perfect justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_refuge.htm">Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>These were specific cities designated by God through Moses and Joshua as safe havens for those who committed manslaughter unintentionally.

Bezer is a <span class="accented">fortification</span>, reminding us of God our stronghold (later criticism, however, gives another derivation to this unusual word, which in <a href="/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24, 25</a>, means the ore of a precious metal), Ramoth is height or exaltation, and to such exaltation we are called in Jesus Christ. Lastly, Golan is exultation, so says Matthew Henry, deriving it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>. But Gesenius derives it with equal probability from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> "to make bare," hence to lead into captivity. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/20-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the cities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">appointed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
