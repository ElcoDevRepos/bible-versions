It was not only a physical divider but also a spiritual symbol, representing the transition from the wilderness wanderings into the Promised Land. The Jordan is frequently mentioned in the Bible, notably in the crossing led by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>), which echoes the earlier crossing of the Red Sea. This river also holds typological significance, as it is where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>), marking the beginning of His public ministry. The Jordan's role as a boundary for Benjamin highlights the tribe's strategic location, serving as a buffer between the eastern tribes and those west of the river.<p><b>These were the borders around the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's youngest son. The allocation of land to Benjamin is detailed in <a href="/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18</a>, where the tribe's territory is described as being between the larger tribes of Judah and Ephraim. This central location was significant in Israel's history, as it included Jerusalem, which later became the political and spiritual center of the nation. The tribe of Benjamin produced several notable biblical figures, including King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/9.htm">1 Samuel 9:1-2</a>) and the Apostle Paul (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). The inheritance of Benjamin, though small, was strategically important and fulfilled Jacob's blessing over Benjamin, describing him as a "ravenous wolf" (<a href="/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a>), indicating a fierce and strategic nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.
