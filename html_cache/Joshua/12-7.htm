It highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The conquest of these kings demonstrates God's faithfulness and the Israelites' obedience to His command to take possession of the Promised Land. This conquest is a continuation of the divine mandate given in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>, where God instructs Israel to defeat and utterly destroy the nations in Canaan.<p><b>beyond the Jordan to the west</b><br>This specifies the geographical area of the conquests, indicating the land west of the Jordan River. This region is significant as it represents the heart of the Promised Land, which was to be divided among the tribes of Israel. The crossing of the Jordan River itself was a miraculous event (Joshua 3-4) that symbolized a new beginning for the Israelites as they entered the land God had promised them.<p><b>from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon</b><br>Baal-gad is located at the foot of Mount Hermon in the Valley of Lebanon, marking the northernmost point of the conquests. The mention of Baal-gad underscores the extent of the territory conquered by Joshua, reaching into areas that were culturally and religiously distinct from the central Canaanite regions. The name "Baal-gad" reflects the Canaanite influence, as "Baal" was a common deity worshiped in the region.<p><b>to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir</b><br>Mount Halak, meaning "the smooth mountain," is identified as the southern boundary of the conquests. It is located near the wilderness of Zin, close to the territory of Edom, which is associated with Seir. This phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of the conquest, stretching from the northern to the southern extremities of the land. The reference to Seir connects to the Edomites, descendants of Esau, and highlights the broader regional context of the Israelite settlement.<p><b>(according to the allotments to the tribes of Israel, Joshua gave them as an inheritance</b><br>This parenthetical note refers to the division of the conquered land among the twelve tribes of Israel, as detailed in <a href="/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13-21</a>. The allotment of land was a fulfillment of God's covenant promise to the patriarchs and was conducted by casting lots, signifying divine guidance in the distribution. The concept of inheritance is central to the identity of Israel as God's chosen people, with each tribe receiving a portion of the land as a perpetual possession.

It reminds believers that the Lord both conquers enemies and lovingly parcels out lasting inheritance to His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these are the kings of the country.</span> We now proceed to the enumeration of the kings whom Joshua had overcome on the western side of Jordan. And the first thing that strikes us is their immense number, as compared to the two potentates who alone occupied the large tract of country subdued on the other side of Jordan. Such a divided territory could hardly have maintained itself in the face of the powerful monarchs Sihon and Og to the eastward of Jordan. We are thus led to the conclusion that the smaller kings must have been tributary to some more powerful monarch who was the head of the confederacy. Such <span class="accented">Bretwaldas</span>, to borrow a term from our own history, the kings of Jerusalem and Hazor appear to have been, the one the head of the northern, the other of the southern tribes of Palestine, while possibly the five Philistine cities may have constituted another league, as they appear to have successfully defied the power of the Israelites from the first. That such confederacies existed at a much earlier time, we find from <a href="/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1-5</a>, where the king of Elam, or Persia, appears as the head of such an one, though of a more extensive character. The resistance to his power organised by the kings in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea is another case in point. Possibly in later times Persia and Babylon found their hands full in their conflict with one another, and with Egypt under Thothmes III., as afterwards under the all-conquering Rameses II., better known as Sesostris, and they had to leave the tribes of Palestine awhile to themselves. Or the rulers of the central power at Carchemish (see Introduction) may have exercised a kind of suzerainty over all. The next point to be observed is that, in the list of kings that follows, a good many are mentioned beside those enumerated in ch. 10. No doubt, as in the earlier history of this island, there were not only heads of leagues, and their tributary monarchs, but under kings also, who were actually subject to the reigning monarchs, and involved in their fall. Compare the other cities mentioned in connection with Gibeon, <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Baal-Gad, in the valley of Lebanon.</span> See for this whole passage note on Joshua 11:16, 17. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/12-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And these [are]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
