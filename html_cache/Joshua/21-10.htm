Aaron, the brother of Moses, was appointed by God as the first high priest, and his descendants were given the responsibility of serving in the tabernacle and later the temple. This priestly lineage is significant in maintaining the religious and ceremonial practices of Israel. The role of the priests was to mediate between God and the people, offering sacrifices and maintaining the holiness of the sanctuary. This lineage is a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, who is described in the New Testament as our High Priest, mediating a new covenant between God and humanity.<p><b>from the Kohathite clans of the Levites</b><br>The Kohathites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, the others being the Gershonites and the Merarites. The Kohathites were responsible for the most sacred parts of the tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the sacred utensils. This responsibility highlights the importance of holiness and reverence in worship, as they were entrusted with the most sacred objects. The Levites, as a whole, were set apart for service to God, and the Kohathites had a special role within this service, emphasizing the theme of being chosen and set apart for God's purposes.<p><b>because the first lot fell to them</b><br>The casting of lots was a common biblical method for making decisions and determining God's will. It was believed that God controlled the outcome, ensuring that His divine plan was followed. The first lot falling to the descendants of Aaron signifies their priority and importance in the distribution of the Levitical cities. This method of allocation underscores the sovereignty of God in the affairs of His people, ensuring that each tribe and clan received their rightful inheritance according to His divine plan. The concept of divine selection and order is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, reflecting God's providence and meticulous care in the establishment of His covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and ancestor of the priestly line.
