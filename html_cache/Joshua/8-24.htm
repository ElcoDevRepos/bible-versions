The men of Ai were lured away from their city, which was a common ancient warfare strategy to weaken the enemy's defenses. The Israelites' victory was not just a result of military prowess but also divine guidance, as God had instructed Joshua on how to conquer Ai (<a href="/joshua/8.htm">Joshua 8:1-2</a>). The field and wilderness refer to the open areas surrounding Ai, which provided the Israelites with the advantage of ambushing their enemies. This tactic reflects the importance of obedience to God's commands, as seen in the broader narrative of Israel's conquest of Canaan.<p><b>and when every last one of them had fallen by the sword</b><br>The phrase underscores the completeness of the victory. The use of the sword signifies the physical and violent nature of ancient warfare. This total destruction of Ai's forces can be seen as a fulfillment of God's judgment against the Canaanites, who were known for their idolatry and immorality (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). The thoroughness of the defeat also serves as a warning to Israel about the consequences of disobedience, as seen in the earlier defeat at Ai due to Achan's sin (Joshua 7).<p><b>all the Israelites returned to Ai</b><br>The return to Ai signifies the shift from battle to occupation. This movement back to the city indicates the Israelites' control over the area, allowing them to execute God's command to take possession of the land. The return also symbolizes a restoration of order and the establishment of Israelite presence in the region, which was crucial for the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>).<p><b>and put it to the sword as well</b><br>This phrase indicates the complete destruction of Ai, including its inhabitants and structures. The phrase "put it to the sword" is a common biblical expression for total annihilation, often associated with the concept of herem, or the devotion of something to destruction for God's purposes (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>). This act was not merely a military conquest but a divine mandate to purify the land from pagan influences. The destruction of Ai serves as a type of final judgment, foreshadowing the ultimate judgment that will come through Jesus Christ, who will defeat all evil and establish His kingdom (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, led by Joshua, executing God's judgment on Ai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ai.htm">Ai</a></b><br>A Canaanite city that opposed Israel, representing resistance to God's plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, tasked with leading the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The area where the inhabitants of Ai were pursued and defeated.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's judgment and the means by which Israel executed His command.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Joshua and Israel's actions demonstrate the importance of following God's instructions fully, even when they are difficult.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_mercy.htm">Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>While the destruction of Ai is an act of judgment, it also serves as a warning and a call to repentance for others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The physical battle against Ai can be seen as a parallel to the spiritual battles Christians face, requiring reliance on God's strength and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The complete destruction of Ai serves as a stark reminder of the seriousness of sin and the ultimate judgment it brings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The victory over Ai underscores God's control over nations and His ability to fulfill His promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_8_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 8:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_8_24_God_s_promise_fulfilled.htm">How does Joshua 8:24 demonstrate God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_obedience_in_Joshua_8_24.htm">What can we learn about obedience to God from Joshua 8:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Joshua_8_24_to_Deuteronomy_s_orders.htm">How does Joshua 8:24 connect to God's commands in Deuteronomy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_8_24_Lessons_for_leaders_today.htm">How should Joshua's leadership in Joshua 8:24 inspire our spiritual leadership today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_trusting_God_s_timing.htm">What does the victory in Joshua 8:24 teach about trusting God's timing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_8_24_Love_and_justice.htm">How does Joshua 8:24 align with the concept of a loving and just God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Joshua_8_24_events.htm">What archaeological evidence supports the events described in Joshua 8:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Interpret_Ai_s_destruction_in_Joshua_8.htm">How should Christians interpret the destruction of Ai in Joshua 8:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_8.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_is_ai's_destruction_just_and_loving.htm">How can the total extermination of Ai&#8217;s inhabitants (Joshua 8:24&#8211;25) be reconciled with a just and loving God?

Each phrase reinforces key truths: God&#8217;s faithfulness to judge sin, His call for wholehearted obedience, and His ability to use even the enemy&#8217;s overconfidence for His purposes. For believers today, the passage urges uncompromising alignment with God&#8217;s Word, sober awareness of sin&#8217;s cost, and confidence that the Lord finishes what He starts&#8212;including ultimate victory in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the wilderness.</span> The LXX. must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">in the going down</span>, or <span class="accented">descent. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Returned unto Ai and smote it.</span> According to God's command, the defenceless inhabitants must share the fate of the army (see <a href="/deuteronomy/20-17.htm">Deuteronomy 20:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/8-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1441;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had finished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
