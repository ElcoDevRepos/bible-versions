It is located near Jericho and served as a base for their operations in Canaan. Gilgal means "circle of stones," which may refer to the memorial stones set up by Joshua. This site becomes a place of remembrance and renewal of the covenant, as seen in later events such as the circumcision of the new generation and the celebration of Passover (<a href="/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2-12</a>).<p><b>Joshua set up the twelve stones</b><br>The act of setting up stones is a common biblical practice for creating memorials or altars (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>). These stones served as a physical reminder of God's miraculous intervention in stopping the Jordan River, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. The number twelve represents the twelve tribes of Israel, symbolizing unity and collective memory. This act reinforces the importance of remembering God's faithfulness and teaching future generations about His deeds (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>).<p><b>they had taken from the Jordan</b><br>The stones were taken from the middle of the Jordan River, where the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant stood (<a href="/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3</a>). This emphasizes the miraculous nature of the crossing, as the river was at flood stage (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>). The stones' origin from the riverbed highlights God's power over nature and His ability to fulfill His promises. This event parallels the crossing of the Red Sea, reinforcing God's continuous guidance and provision for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.

The use of the first person in <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.">Joshua 5:1</a>, "until <span class= "ital">we </span>were passed over," is most naturally explained by taking the verse as part of what the Israelites were to say to their children by the command of Joshua. The difficulty has been met in the Hebrew Bible by a Masoretic reading, in which "they" is substituted for "we." But the more difficult reading is to be preferred. There is nothing else in the section that creates any difficulty. The twenty-third verse authorises a comparison between the passage of Jordan and the passage of the Red Sea. As the one is called a "baptising unto Moses," in the <span class= "ital">New </span>Testament, we may call the other a baptising unto Joshua. (Comp. the "us" in <a href="/joshua/4-23.htm" title="For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until you were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:">Joshua 4:23</a>, with the "we" of <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.">Joshua 5:1</a>.) The first person also appears in <a href="/joshua/4-6.htm" title="That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean you by these stones?">Joshua 4:6</a>, "that he would give us." It would appear that, besides explaining the erection of the <span class= "ital">stones, </span>the Israelites were also to explain to their children the meaning of Gilgal, the place where the stones were, and this explanation is not completed until the end of <a href="/joshua/4-9.htm" title="And Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.">Joshua 4:9</a>.<p><span class= "bld"> . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/4-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
