The term "Halak" means "smooth" or "bald," suggesting a barren or rocky landscape. This area marks the southern extent of Joshua's conquests. Seir is associated with the Edomites, descendants of Esau, and represents a region south of the Dead Sea. The mention of Seir highlights the geographical breadth of the conquest, extending from the southern to the northern parts of the land.<p><b>as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon</b><br>Baal-gad is situated at the northern boundary of the land conquered by Joshua, near Mount Hermon. The name "Baal-gad" indicates a place of worship dedicated to the Canaanite god Baal, reflecting the prevalent pagan practices in the region. The Valley of Lebanon is a fertile area, and its mention signifies the strategic and economic importance of the territory. This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the conquest, from the southern deserts to the lush northern valleys.<p><b>at the foot of Mount Hermon</b><br>Mount Hermon is a significant landmark in the northern part of Israel, known for its height and snow-capped peaks. It serves as a natural boundary and is often associated with the northern limits of the Promised Land. In biblical literature, Mount Hermon is sometimes linked to divine encounters and is considered a place of spiritual significance. Its mention here emphasizes the extent of the land under Israelite control.<p><b>He captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death</b><br>This phrase highlights the complete military victory achieved by Joshua over the Canaanite kings. The capture and execution of these kings symbolize the decisive nature of the conquest and the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to the Israelites. This act of judgment reflects the biblical theme of divine justice against the idolatry and wickedness of the Canaanite nations. It also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, as Joshua (a type of Christ) leads his people to inherit the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_halak.htm">Mount Halak</a></b><br>A mountain mentioned as the starting point of Joshua's conquests in this passage.

This may either be interpreted "the mountain bare of foliage," as opposed to Seir, the hairy or wooded mountain, as Masius and Rosenmuller suppose, or, as the latter also suggests, it may mean the mountain which has a smooth outline, as opposed to a precipitous cliff. This falls in with the character of the hills on the south of Palestine (see note on Joshua 10:40). The LXX. renders by a proper name. But this the article forbids. The Syriac interpreter renders "the <span class="accented">dividing</span> mountain."

He gives up the other "smooth" or "bald" mountains, because they do not "go up to Self." Later explorers have failed to settle its situation. Seir. This mountainous region was well known as the territory of Esau (see <a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon. For <span class="accented">valley</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) <span class="accented">see</span> note on ver. 8. Baal-gad has been by some identified with Baalbek, or Heliopolis, a Syrian city, whose vast ruins strike the beholder with astonishment even now. But Baalbek lay considerably to the north of Palestine. It has therefore with greater probability been identified by Robinson, Von Raumer, and others, with Paneas or Caesarea Philippi. Baal-gad signifies "the lord of fortune," an aspect under which the Babylonian Baal or Bel was frequently worshipped. The word Gad, erroneously translated "troop" in our version (<a href="/genesis/30-11.htm">Genesis 30:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-11.htm">Isaiah 65:11</a>), is properly "fortune," and hence the god Fortune. The worship of Pan in later times supplanted that of Baal, but traces of both cults, in inscriptions and niches, may be found in the neighbourhood to the present day (see Tristram, 'Land of Israel'). All travellers speak with enthusiasm of the situation of Banias. Josephus says that it affords a profusion of natural gifts. Seetzen corroborates him. Dean Stanley compares it to Tivoli, and Canon Tristram thinks that in its rocks, caverns, and cascades there is much to remind the visitor of what is perhaps the loveliest place in all Italy. He continues, "The situation of Banias is indeed magnificent. With tall limestone cliffs to the north and east, a rugged torrent of basalt to the south, and a gentle slope for its western front, Banias is almost hidden till the traveller is among the ruins." Banias stands at the end of a gorge of the Hermon range with the wide range of the Huleh plain opening out before it, as the Campagna and Rome in the distance are seen from the mouth of the gorge at Tivoli. Vandevelds, however, identifies Banias with Beth-rehob, on the insufficient ground that Baal-gad is said to be in, not at, the mouth of the valley or Bik'ath of Lebanon. He prefers the castles either of Bostra or of Aisafa, the one an hour and a half, the other three hours north of Banias. It should be added that an arm of the Jordan rises and rushes through the gorge here, "praeceps," like the Anio at Tivoli. The valley of Lebanon is supposed by some not to be the valley between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, but the country on the southern declivity of Mount Hermon.
