This location is significant as it was a strategic gathering point for the northern coalition of Canaanite kings. The geographical setting provided a natural defense, yet it also became the site of their defeat. This reflects the biblical theme of God using seemingly strong positions of the enemy to demonstrate His power and deliverance.<p><b>Joshua and his whole army</b><br>Joshua, as the leader of Israel, is a type of Christ, leading God's people into the Promised Land. His name, meaning "The Lord is salvation," parallels Jesus' role in the New Testament. The mention of "his whole army" emphasizes the unity and collective effort of the Israelites under divine guidance. This unity is crucial for the success of God's people, as seen throughout biblical narratives.<p><b>came upon them suddenly</b><br>The element of surprise is a recurring military tactic in the Bible, often used to demonstrate God's wisdom and strategic superiority over human plans. This sudden approach reflects divine guidance, as God often instructed Israel to use unconventional methods to achieve victory, underscoring His sovereignty and the importance of obedience to His commands.<p><b>and attacked them</b><br>The attack signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel the land of Canaan. It also represents the spiritual battles believers face, where reliance on God's strength leads to victory. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's people overcoming through faith and obedience, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, which speaks of the armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_army.htm">The Whole Army</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelite forces under Joshua's command, united in their mission to conquer the land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_waters_of_merom.htm">The Waters of Merom</a></b><br>A location in northern Canaan where Joshua launched a surprise attack against a coalition of Canaanite kings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_kings.htm">Canaanite Kings</a></b><br>A coalition of kings from the northern regions of Canaan who gathered to fight against Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sudden_attack.htm">Sudden Attack</a></b><br>A strategic military maneuver by Joshua, emphasizing the element of surprise and divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_strategy.htm">Divine Strategy</a></b><br>God often uses unexpected means to achieve His purposes.
