The promise referred to here is found in <a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>, where God assured Caleb that he would enter the Promised Land because of his faithfulness. This highlights the biblical theme of God's covenant faithfulness, a recurring motif throughout Scripture, seen in His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>He has kept me alive these forty-five years</b><br>Caleb acknowledges God's providence in sustaining his life. This period of 45 years includes the 40 years of Israel's wandering in the wilderness and the subsequent 5 years of conquest in Canaan. The preservation of Caleb's life is a testament to God's protection and provision, similar to how God sustained the Israelites with manna and quail.<p><b>since He spoke this word to Moses</b><br>The "word" refers to God's promise that Caleb would inherit the land he had explored (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>). Moses, as the leader and prophet, was the intermediary through whom God communicated His will. This underscores the importance of prophetic leadership in Israel's history and the authority of God's word delivered through His chosen servants.<p><b>while Israel wandered in the wilderness</b><br>This phrase recalls the period of Israel's disobedience and lack of faith, resulting in their 40-year journey in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). It serves as a reminder of the consequences of unbelief and disobedience, contrasting with Caleb's faithfulness. The wilderness experience is often seen as a time of testing and preparation for entering the Promised Land.<p><b>So here I am today, eighty-five years old</b><br>Caleb's age signifies not only the passage of time but also his enduring strength and faith. At 85, he is still ready to claim his inheritance, demonstrating that God's promises are not limited by human age or ability. This reflects the biblical principle that God empowers those who trust in Him, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, where those who hope in the Lord renew their strength.
