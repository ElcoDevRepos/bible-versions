The term "acted unfaithfully" suggests a violation of trust and obedience to God's commands. The "things devoted to destruction" refers to items that were to be completely destroyed or consecrated to God, as instructed in the conquest of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-19</a>). This act of unfaithfulness is significant because it contrasts with the previous victories and obedience of the Israelites, showing the seriousness of disobedience to God's commands. The concept of "devoted to destruction" (Hebrew: "herem") indicates items that are under a ban, meant to be destroyed as an offering to God, symbolizing the removal of sin and idolatry from the land.<p><b>Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah,</b><br>Achan's lineage is detailed, emphasizing the personal responsibility and the impact of individual sin on the community. The mention of his ancestry, tracing back to Zerah, one of the sons of Judah, highlights the importance of tribal identity and heritage in Israelite society. Judah was a prominent tribe, and this connection underscores the gravity of Achan's sin, as it brings dishonor to a significant lineage. The detailed genealogy also serves to identify Achan clearly, leaving no ambiguity about who is responsible for the transgression.<p><b>took some of what was set apart.</b><br>Achan's action of taking what was "set apart" signifies a direct violation of God's command. The items were meant to be either destroyed or dedicated to the Lord's treasury, as per the instructions given in <a href="/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18-19</a>. This act of taking what was consecrated to God represents a breach of holiness and a failure to honor God's sovereignty. It reflects the temptation and sin of covetousness, reminiscent of the sin of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where taking what was forbidden led to dire consequences.<p><b>So the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites.</b><br>The collective consequence of Achan's sin is seen in the phrase "the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites." This indicates that individual sin can have communal repercussions, affecting the entire nation. The "anger of the LORD" is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, signifying God's righteous response to sin and disobedience. It serves as a warning of the seriousness of covenant violations and the need for holiness among God's people. This phrase also foreshadows the subsequent defeat at Ai, illustrating the tangible effects of divine displeasure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective people of God who were journeying to the Promised Land.

Though a single man sinned, the text immediately speaks of &#8220;the Israelites,&#8221; showing how God views His people corporately (see also <a href="/joshua/22-20.htm">Joshua 22:20</a>).<p>- The seriousness of violating something &#8220;devoted to destruction&#8221; (&#7717;erem) is underscored later when Saul spares Amalekite spoil and is rejected as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-1.htm">1 Samuel 15:1&#8211;23</a>). Nothing God designates for destruction may be treated as common property.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah</b><p>- Scripture now moves from corporate responsibility to individual accountability. By naming four generations, Joshua pinpoints the offender beyond dispute (compare <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, &#8220;your sin will find you out&#8221;).<p>- Achan is from Judah, the tribe destined for leadership (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8&#8211;10</a>). His failure contrasts sharply with Judah&#8217;s future role and with the obedience of Caleb, another Judahite (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6&#8211;14</a>).<p>- The genealogy shows that spiritual heritage does not guarantee obedience; every generation must choose faithfulness (<a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Took some of what was set apart</b><p>- The action is simple yet devastating. Just &#8220;some&#8221; was enough to break fellowship with God (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p>- Later verses tell us Achan coveted a beautiful cloak, silver, and gold (<a href="/joshua/7-20.htm">Joshua 7:20&#8211;21</a>), mirroring the deadly trio of &#8220;lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>).<p>- His theft stands in stark contrast to Rahab&#8217;s faith in the previous chapter; both were acts done in secret, but one demonstrated trust, the other rebellion (<a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-8.htm">Joshua 2:8&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites</b><p>- God&#8217;s holiness demands judgment (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). The word &#8220;burned&#8221; conveys intense wrath, the same expression used when Israel worshiped the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>).<p>- Because Israel is one covenant community, unconfessed sin by one member blocks communal blessing (<a href="/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a>). This principle explains why the next battle at Ai ends in defeat until sin is removed (<a href="/joshua/7-5.htm">Joshua 7:5, 13</a>).<p>- Yet God&#8217;s anger, though fierce, is purposeful: it disciplines to restore. After judgment, the covenant relationship is mended, and victory returns (<a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a> teaches that covenant unfaithfulness, even by a single individual, brings real corporate consequences. God&#8217;s clear commands about devoted things were ignored, revealing how covetous desires can override prior victories. By naming Achan, Scripture affirms personal responsibility; by stating that the LORD&#8217;s anger burned against &#8220;the Israelites,&#8221; it affirms communal accountability. The verse warns believers to guard against hidden sin, submit to God&#8217;s holiness, and remember that obedience is the only path to ongoing blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Achan . . . of the tribe of Judah.</span>--The tribe of Judah is distinguished in sacred history both for great crimes and great achievements.

He had "troubled Israel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), ver. 25, and the valley which witnessed his punishment obtained the name of Achor. The copies of the LXX. vary between the two forms, the Vatican Codex having Achar; the Alexandrian, Achan. <span class="cmt_word">Zabdi</span><span class="accented">. Zimri</span> in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>. Such variations of reading are extremely common, and are increased in our version by the varieties of English spelling adopted among our translators (see Shemuel for Samuel in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>). The LXX. has <span class="accented">Zambri</span> here. <span class="cmt_word">Took of the accursed thing.</span> Commentators have largely discussed the question how the sin of Achan could be held to extend to the whole people. But it seems sufficient to reply by pointing out the organic unity of the Israelitish nation. They were then, as Christians are now, the Church of the living God. And if one single member of the community violated the laws which God imposed on them, the whole body was liable for his sin, until it had purged itself by a public act of restitution (see <a href="/deuteronomy/21-1.htm">Deuteronomy 21:1-8</a>). So St. Paul regards the Corinthian Church as polluted by the presence of one single offender, until he was publicly expelled from its communion (see <a href="/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2, 6, 7</a>). The very words "body politic" applied to a state imply the same idea - that of a connection so intimate between the members of a community that the act of one affects the whole. And if this be admitted to be the case in ordinary societies, how much more so in the people of God, who were under His special protection, and had been specially set apart to His service? In the history of Achan, moreover, we read the history of secret sin, which, though unseen by any earthly eye, does nevertheless pollute the offender, and through him the Church of God, by lowering his general standard of thought and action, enfeebling his moral sense, checking the growth of his inner and devotional life, until, by a resolute act of repentance and restitution towards God, the sin is finally acknowledged and put away. "A lewd man is a pernicious creature. That he damnes his own soule is the least part of his misehiefe; he commonly drawes vengeance upon a thousand, either by the desert of his sinne, or by the infection" (Bp. Hall). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Israelites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">however,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1435;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">acted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yim&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
