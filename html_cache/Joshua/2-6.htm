Rahab's decision to take the spies to the roof indicates her quick thinking and resourcefulness. This action also reflects the cultural practice of utilizing rooftops for storage and concealment. Rahab's actions demonstrate her faith and courage, aligning her with other biblical figures who acted decisively in faith, such as Moses' mother hiding him (<a href="/exodus/2-2.htm">Exodus 2:2-3</a>).<p><b>and hidden them among the stalks of flax</b><br>Flax was a common crop in the ancient Near East, used for making linen. The presence of flax on the roof suggests it was harvest time, likely spring, which aligns with the timing of the Israelites' crossing of the Jordan River. The use of flax for hiding the spies is significant, as it symbolizes Rahab's integration into the local economy and culture, yet she chooses to align herself with God's people. This act of hiding the spies foreshadows the protective covering of Christ's righteousness for believers (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>that she had laid out there</b><br>The process of laying out flax involved drying it to prepare for processing into linen. This detail highlights Rahab's industrious nature and her role in her household's economy. It also underscores the providential timing of the spies' visit, as the flax provided a natural hiding place. Rahab's actions can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where ordinary elements are used for extraordinary purposes, reflecting God's sovereignty and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho, known for her occupation as a prostitute.

"Two strangers, Israelites, spies, have a safe harbour provided them, even amongst their enemies, against the proclamation of a king." "Where cannot the God of heaven either find or raise up friends to His own causes and servants?" (Bp.
