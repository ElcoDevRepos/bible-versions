This act of protection is pivotal in the narrative, demonstrating her faith and aligning her with God's purposes. In the cultural context of ancient Near Eastern societies, hospitality was a sacred duty, but Rahab's actions went beyond mere hospitality, indicating a recognition of the God of Israel's power. Her actions prefigure the concept of faith leading to righteousness, as later highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a> and <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>, where Rahab is commended for her faith and works.<p><b>So she said, &#8220;Yes, the men did come to me,</b><br>Rahab's acknowledgment of the men's presence is a strategic move. In the context of ancient warfare and espionage, admitting the presence of foreign spies could have been dangerous. However, Rahab's admission is part of her calculated plan to protect them. This reflects her wisdom and courage, qualities that are often celebrated in biblical narratives. Her actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides refuge and protection to those who seek Him.<p><b>but I did not know where they had come from.</b><br>Rahab's statement is a half-truth, a common narrative device in biblical stories where characters navigate complex moral situations. This reflects the tension between truth and survival in a hostile environment. Her claim of ignorance about the spies' origins serves to mislead the king's men, protecting the spies and furthering God's plan for Israel. This moment underscores the theme of divine providence, where God uses unexpected individuals and means to accomplish His purposes, as seen throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho, known for her occupation as a prostitute.

Scripture records her statement without commending the lie, yet it shows how God can work through flawed human choices to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>- Similar moral tension appears with the Hebrew midwives who deceived Pharaoh to save infants (<a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15-21</a>).<p>- The key takeaway is God&#8217;s sovereignty: He honors Rahab&#8217;s faith and rescues her family, incorporating her into Israel and even the Messianic line (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>), illustrating that grace outweighs past sins and imperfect methods.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/2-4.htm">Joshua 2:4</a> portrays Rahab&#8217;s courageous, faith-driven decision to hide the spies and misdirect the king&#8217;s men.

For, as Calvin remarks, Rahab would hardly have dared to lie so coolly had she not previously taken precautions to conceal her guests. And therefore she must have told a twofold falsehood. She must have discovered, or been made acquainted with, their errand, and therefore have "known whence they were," in addition to her assertion that she did not know where they were now. <span class="cmt_word">And hid them.</span> The original is remarkable and very vivid. <span class="accented">And hid him, i.e.</span>, each one in a separate place.
