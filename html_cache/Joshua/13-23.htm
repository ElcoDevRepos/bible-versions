The allocation of land to the Reubenites on the east side of the Jordan River was significant as it marked the boundary of their inheritance. This location was strategic for trade and defense, as the Jordan River served as a natural barrier. The Reubenites' territory included fertile lands suitable for agriculture and livestock, which was essential for their sustenance and prosperity. The Jordan River also held spiritual significance, as it was the site where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>) and where Jesus was later baptized by John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>).<p><b>This was the inheritance of the clans of the Reubenites,</b><br>The term "inheritance" reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). Each tribe received a portion of land as their inheritance, which was to be passed down through generations. The division of land among the clans of Reuben underscores the importance of family and tribal identity in ancient Israelite society. It also highlights the organizational structure of the nation, where each tribe had specific responsibilities and roles. The concept of inheritance in the Old Testament often points to the spiritual inheritance believers receive through faith in Christ, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a>).<p><b>including the cities and villages.</b><br>The mention of cities and villages indicates the settled nature of the Reubenites' inheritance. This contrasts with their previous nomadic lifestyle during the wilderness wanderings. The cities provided centers for administration, worship, and community life, while the villages supported agricultural activities. Archaeological evidence from the region reveals fortified cities and rural settlements, reflecting the historical reality of the biblical narrative. The establishment of cities and villages also fulfilled God's command to occupy and cultivate the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-12</a>). This settlement pattern foreshadows the New Testament concept of the Church as a community of believers, living and working together in unity (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites.htm">Reubenites</a></b><br>Descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Jacob and Leah.

The LXX. translates, "And the borders of Reuben were the Jordan-border." This seems to be the meaning of the original. The phrase often occurs, as in <a href="/joshua/15-12.htm">Joshua 15:12</a> and <a href="/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6</a>. Knobel's explanation is probably the correct one, that the phrase means to refer to the natural boundary marked out by the river or sea and its banks. "The boundary of the children of Reuben was Jordan and the natural boundary thus formed." As Dean Stanley reminds us in his 'Lectures on the Jewish Church,' Reuben, as predicted by Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), sank at once into insignificance. No ruler, no judge arose from this tribe and its territory. <span class="cmt_word">Villages</span>.

Here it would mean,either with Gesenins and Keil, <span class="accented">farm hamlets</span>, or perhaps <span class="accented">clearings</span> of cultivated ground, which in Palestine would naturally be enclosed in some way, to prevent the ravages of wild beasts. In the primitive villages of Servia, where wild beasts are not entirely extirpated, not only are all the homesteads enclosed, but a fence is placed across the road, and removed when a vehicle has to pass through. Or perhaps the primitive Jewish community was similar to the primitive Teutonic community as described by Marshall in his 'Elementary and Practical Treatise on Landed Property,' published in 1804, who described the early distribution of land in this country as follows: "Round the village lay a few small enclosures for rearing young stock. Further a field the best land for arable purposes was chosen, and divided into three parts, for the necessary, rotation of fallow, wheat or rye, and spring crops. The meadows near the water courses were set aside for the growth of fodder for the cattle or for pasturage for milch cows, <span class="accented">etc</span>. The irreclaimable lands were left for what we now call 'common' uses for fuel, and the inferior pasturage." These arrangements are found to exist in India (see Sir H. Maine, 'Village Communities,' sec. 4.). But there, as in Palestine, the necessity for water was the cause of important modifications.
