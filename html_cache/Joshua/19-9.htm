This reflects the fulfillment of Jacob's prophecy in <a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>, where Simeon and Levi are scattered in Israel. Historically, Simeon was absorbed into Judah, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27-43</a>, where Simeonites are mentioned as living in Judah's cities. This arrangement also highlights the unity and cooperation among the tribes during the conquest and settlement of Canaan.<p><b>because the share for Judah&#8217;s descendants was too large for them</b><br>Judah's initial allotment was extensive, reflecting its prominence and leadership among the tribes, as seen in <a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>. The large territory was a practical necessity for supporting a populous tribe, but it also demonstrated God's abundant provision. The reduction of Judah's territory to accommodate Simeon illustrates the principle of stewardship and sharing resources within the community of God's people, aligning with the biblical theme of justice and equity.<p><b>So the Simeonites received an inheritance within Judah&#8217;s portion</b><br>This arrangement allowed the Simeonites to maintain their tribal identity while benefiting from the protection and resources of the larger tribe of Judah. It foreshadows the New Testament concept of unity within diversity in the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>. The integration of Simeon into Judah's territory also prefigures the eventual unification of Israel under a single monarchy, with David from the tribe of Judah as king, pointing to the ultimate unity found in Jesus Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeonites.htm">Simeonites</a></b><br>Descendants of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

In <a href="/bsb/joshua/15.htm">Joshua 15</a> the borders of Judah are described as stretching from the southern wilderness up to Jerusalem&#8212;an expansive and fertile region. Because God had already directed that every tribe receive its own territory (<a href="/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>), and because Simeon&#8217;s census numbers had dropped dramatically since leaving Egypt (<a href="/numbers/26-12.htm">Numbers 26:12&#8211;14</a>), the practical solution was to carve out towns from Judah&#8217;s surplus. This move also hints at the prophetic word spoken over Simeon: &#8220;I will scatter them in Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>). Far from chance, the allocation fulfills both prophecy and practical necessity while highlighting unity between Judah and Simeon, who had earlier fought side by side against the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the share for Judah&#8217;s descendants was too large for them</b><p>Judah&#8217;s &#8220;share&#8221; was &#8220;too large&#8221; in two senses&#8212;geographic size and population capacity (<a href="/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a> shows they still had areas to conquer). God&#8217;s distribution of blessing often exceeds immediate need, creating opportunity for generosity (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>). The excess here serves the broader covenant family: Judah surrenders towns without complaint, modeling the principle later articulated in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7&#8211;11</a> that abundance should meet a brother&#8217;s lack. It also foreshadows the promised leadership role of Judah, who not only receives honor (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8&#8211;10</a>) but also extends provision. By willingly sharing, Judah exemplifies servant-leadership long before David or the Messiah would come from its line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the Simeonites received an inheritance within Judah&#8217;s portion</b><p>The final phrase shows God&#8217;s faithfulness to Simeon despite earlier failures (<a href="/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>). The tribe receives a cluster of cities&#8212;Beer-sheba, Moladah, Hazar-shual, and others (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1&#8211;8</a>)&#8212;all lying inside Judah&#8217;s perimeter. This arrangement kept Simeon close to the spiritual center: Hebron, later the first capital of David (<a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>). Centuries on, when the kingdom divided, many Simeonites remained loyal to Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>), suggesting that proximity fostered faithfulness. The arrangement also maintains tribal identity while encouraging interdependence, a picture of the wider body of believers where distinct callings thrive &#8220;within&#8221; shared grace (<a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/19-9.htm">Joshua 19:9</a> demonstrates God&#8217;s precise, gracious oversight in allotting Israel&#8217;s inheritance. Judah&#8217;s abundance becomes Simeon&#8217;s provision, fulfilling prophecy, modeling generosity, and weaving the tribes together in cooperative faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance.</span> Of the later history of the children of Simeon we find a little recorded in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-39.htm">1 Chronicles 4:39-42</a>, and some suppose that the event recorded there is a fulfilment of the prophecy in <a href="/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19</a>. Dr. Pusey mentions a tribe still existing in the south, professing to be of the sons of Israel, and holding no connection with the Arabs of the neighbourhood, and supposes them to be the descendants of the five hundred Simeonites who took possession of Mount Seir in the days of Hezekiah.
