The "rest" refers to a cessation of large-scale warfare, fulfilling God's promise to give Israel the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>). This rest symbolizes a period of peace and stability, allowing the Israelites to settle and establish their society according to the laws given by Moses. Theologically, this rest can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>), where believers find spiritual rest from the burden of sin.<p><b>when Joshua was old and well along in years</b><br>Joshua's advanced age signifies the end of an era. He is one of the last direct links to the generation that experienced the Exodus and the wilderness wanderings. His leadership was crucial in the conquest and initial settlement of Canaan. The mention of his age underscores the urgency of his forthcoming address to the Israelites, as he prepares to pass on leadership and remind them of their covenant obligations. This transition period is critical, as it sets the stage for the challenges Israel will face in maintaining faithfulness to God without Joshua's direct leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the leader of Israel who succeeded Moses.

Or it may be that we have here, as it were, "the two evenings" of Joshua's life: the early evening, when his sun began to decline--the afternoon; and the late evening, just before its glorious setting in the service of Jehovah on earth, to "serve Him day and night in His temple."<p>(Our Lord fed the five thousand between the two evenings--<a href="/matthew/14-15.htm" title="And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.">Matthew 14:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/14-23.htm" title="And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.">Matthew 14:23</a>.

But this refers to a more advanced age still, when the patriarch felt his powers failing him, and desired, as far as his influence went, to preserve the Israelites in the path in which they had walked since their entrance into Canaan. Calvin has some good remarks on the "pious solicitude" shown by the aged warrior for those whom he had led in time of war and guided in time of peace. He seems to have sent for the chief men in Israel to his home at Timnath-Serah, where apparently he had led a retired and peaceful life, only coming forward to direct the affairs of the nation when necessity required. His address is simple and practical. He reminds them that they will soon lose the benefit of his experience and authority, and of the work that he had done, under God's direction, in settling them in the land. Then he proceeds to urge strict obedience to the law of God, reminding them that victory is assured to them, if they will but be true to themselves and their calling as the servants of God, but that as certainly as they neglect to do so, wrath and misery will be their portion. He emphasizes his words by reminding them how amply God had fulfilled his promise, and concludes with a picture of the evil which will befall them if they rebel against God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/23-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A long</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
