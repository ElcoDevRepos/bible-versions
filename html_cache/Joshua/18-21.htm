The allocation of land to the tribes was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land of Canaan. Benjamin's territory was strategically located between the powerful tribes of Judah and Ephraim, which often placed it at the center of Israel's political and military activities. The tribe of Benjamin played a significant role in Israel's history, producing notable figures such as King Saul and the Apostle Paul.<p><b>Jericho:</b><br>Jericho is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and is famously known for its conquest by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership, as recorded in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>. The fall of Jericho was a miraculous event where the walls of the city collapsed after the Israelites marched around them for seven days. This event demonstrated God's power and faithfulness in delivering the land to His people. Jericho's location near the Jordan River made it a key city for trade and military strategy.<p><b>Beth-hoglah:</b><br>Beth-hoglah was located in the Jordan Valley, near the Dead Sea. Its name means "house of the partridge," which may indicate the presence of wildlife in the area. The city was part of the border between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. The mention of Beth-hoglah in the tribal allotment underscores the detailed and specific nature of the land distribution among the tribes, reflecting God's order and provision for His people.<p><b>Emek-keziz:</b><br>Emek-keziz, meaning "valley of the cut-off," is less well-known and not frequently mentioned in other biblical texts. Its inclusion in the list of cities highlights the comprehensive nature of the land division. The precise location of Emek-keziz is uncertain, but it serves as a reminder of the thoroughness with which the Israelites recorded their inheritance, ensuring that each clan received its rightful portion. This meticulous record-keeping reflects the importance of land as a divine gift and a source of identity and sustenance for the tribes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>An ancient city known for its fortified walls, which fell after the Israelites marched around them for seven days as instructed by God.

The record is factual, geographical, and covenantal.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s power over Jericho&#8217;s walls (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>) shows how He clears the way for His people to occupy what He has promised.<p>&#8226; Though once in ruins, Jericho would later host the ministry of Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm">2 Kings 2:15&#8211;22</a>) and the compassion of Jesus (<a href="/luke/19-1.htm">Luke 19:1&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46&#8211;52</a>). Benjamin&#8217;s inheritance therefore carries a testimony of both judgment and mercy, reminding us that the Lord can transform even the most broken places.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Beth-hoglah</b><p>Next: &#8220;&#8230;Beth-hoglah&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Beth-hoglah was a village on the lower Jordan plain, also marking the border between Judah and Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/15-6.htm">Joshua 15:6</a>; 18:19).<p>&#8226; It served as a landmark when the Jordan was first crossed (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The inclusion of a seemingly modest settlement shows God&#8217;s care for every clan and household. Nothing is incidental in His record.<p>&#8226; Small though it was, Beth-hoglah stood where God&#8217;s promises literally touched down in the land. Its mention reminds us that ordinary places become holy ground when tied to covenant fulfillment (<a href="/genesis/28-16.htm">Genesis 28:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Emek-keziz</b><p>The verse continues: &#8220;&#8230;Emek-keziz,&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; This &#8220;valley of Keziz&#8221; is otherwise unknown to us, yet its name was etched by the Spirit to certify that the territory was fully cataloged.<p>&#8226; Lists like this echo <a href="/numbers/33-2.htm">Numbers 33:2</a> and <a href="/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1-7</a>, where God insists on detailing what He has given. Precision underscores reliability.<p>&#8226; Even when archaeology has not yet pinpointed a location, believers can rest in the inerrant record: every valley and hill allotted to Benjamin was literally there, held in real space and time.<p>&#8226; Emek-keziz represents the hidden portions of inheritance&#8212;areas we may overlook yet God fully sees (<a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a> opens Benjamin&#8217;s city list with three names. Jericho proclaims God&#8217;s victory and grace; Beth-hoglah highlights His faithfulness in the everyday; Emek-keziz assures us that every promise is exact, even when unseen.
