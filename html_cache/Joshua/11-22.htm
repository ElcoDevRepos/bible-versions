They were descendants of Anak and were considered a significant threat to the Israelites. The eradication of the Anakim from the land signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites victory over their enemies. This phrase highlights the completeness of Joshua's conquest in the Promised Land, as the Anakim were among the most feared inhabitants. The removal of these giants symbolizes the triumph of faith and obedience over seemingly insurmountable obstacles, reflecting the broader theme of divine assistance in Israel's military campaigns.<p><b>only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive.</b><br>Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod were Philistine cities located in the coastal region of Canaan. These cities were part of the Philistine pentapolis and remained outside the immediate control of the Israelites during Joshua's conquest. The survival of the Anakim in these areas suggests that while Joshua's campaign was largely successful, some territories remained unconquered, foreshadowing future conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines. Gath is notably mentioned as the hometown of Goliath, the giant defeated by David, indicating that remnants of the Anakim lineage persisted and continued to pose challenges to Israel. This phrase underscores the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and their neighbors, as well as the need for continued reliance on God for victory and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/anakim.htm">Anakim</a></b><br>A race of giants mentioned in the Old Testament, known for their formidable size and strength.

Only small pockets in Philistine territory remained, setting the stage for later showdowns but underscoring that God had delivered the land into Israel&#8217;s hands.

But it had almost died out. Goliath and his brethren seem to have been regarded by the Philistines, as much as by the Hebrews, in the light of prodigies. It may be that the race deteriorated in size and strength, when driven from the mountain district. Gaza (Hebrew Azzah, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a>) was a stronghold of the Philistines. We first find it mentioned as the border of Canaan in <a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>. It was the scene of the exploits of Samson, related in <a href="/judges/16.htm">Judges 16</a>. It, with Gath, Ekron, Ashdod, and Ashkelon, formed the five Philistine lordships mentioned in <a href="/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>. Gaza does not appear in the list of cities captured by David, although Gath does. Perhaps the strength of its position (Azzah signifies strength) may have enabled it to resist David and Solomon, whose dominions are said to have extended to, but not to have included, Azzah. We read little more of it in the Old Testament. Jeremiah says that Pharaoh smote it (Joshua 47:1); Amos and Zephaniah threatened it with punishment. It is mentioned in <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a> as a place of some importance. And it still exists, at about an hour's journey from the sea, and is now called Ghazzeh. (see also note on ver. 41). Gath. Also one of the five Philistine lordships. In David's time it had a king, with whom David took refuge (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>). It was afterwards conquered by David (<a href="/2_samuel/21-20.htm">2 Samuel 21:20</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/20-6.htm">1 Chronicles 20:6</a>). We find it in Solomon's jurisdiction, though under the government of one of its own royal family (<a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>). Rehoboam fortified it (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>). Hazael, the powerful king of Syria, wrested it from Jehoash, and was only bought air from assailing Jerusalem. Uzziah retook it once more (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). Hezekiah seems to have retained it (<a href="/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>). After this we hear no more of it. Modern travellers and commentators have identified it with Beit-Jibrin (the house of the mighty - perhaps a reminiscence of Goliath and his kindred), now Eleutheropolis (so Knobel). Others suppose it to be the Blanche Garde of the Crusaders, or Tell-es-Safieh, an opinion supported, among others, by Mr. J. L. Porter and Lieut. Conder. See, however, the note on Libnah, <a href="/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29</a>. Ashdod. Later Azotus, now Esdud. Here the ark was carried after the disastrous defeat related in <a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>. It was conquered by Uzziah (no doubt it had formerly been reduced by David), who built forts to overawe it (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), but it fell into the hands of Sargon, king of Assyria, a little later (<a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>). It is frequently mentioned by the prophets, and we find that Jonathan, the brother of Judas Maceabaeus, burnt the temple of Dagon there (1 Macc. 10:83, 84). It is mentioned as Azotus in <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/11-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Anakim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6062.htm">Strong's 6062: </a> </span><span class="str2">Anakim -- 'neck', a giant people around Hebron and in Philistia</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3498.htm">Strong's 3498: </a> </span><span class="str2">To jut over, exceed, to excel, to remain, be left, to leave, cause to abound, preserve</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
