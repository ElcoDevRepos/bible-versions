The Jordan River itself is a critical geographical feature in biblical history, symbolizing the transition from the wilderness wanderings to the Promised Land. The land of Canaan represents the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, a land flowing with milk and honey. This setting underscores the importance of the events that follow, as they occur in a place of divine promise and covenant.<p><b>the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</b><br>These tribes were part of the Transjordan tribes who had requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>. Their decision was based on the suitability of the land for their livestock. Moses granted their request on the condition that they assist the other tribes in conquering Canaan. This moment marks their return to their allotted inheritance after fulfilling their military obligations, highlighting themes of duty, unity, and the fulfillment of promises.<p><b>built an imposing altar there by the Jordan</b><br>The construction of an altar by these tribes was a significant act, as altars were central to worship and sacrifice in Israelite religion. This altar's imposing nature suggests it was meant to be a visible and lasting structure. The act of building an altar could be seen as a declaration of faith and a desire to maintain a connection with the rest of Israel, despite the physical separation by the Jordan River. This event foreshadows the potential for misunderstanding and conflict, as seen later in the chapter, and emphasizes the importance of communication and unity among God's people. The altar also serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate altar and mediator between God and humanity, bridging any divide.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites,_gadites,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Reubenites, Gadites, and the Half-Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>These are the tribes who settled on the east side of the Jordan River.

That detail is crucial; it shows they have not abandoned the covenant land but remain connected to it (compare <a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-2.htm">Deuteronomy 27:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Placement &#8220;near the Jordan&#8221; recalls how God parted the same river when Israel entered (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14&#8211;17</a>).

Verses 24&#8211;27 explain: as a witness so future generations know the eastern tribes share the same God, worship, and covenant as those west of the Jordan.<p>&#8226; The concern for a single place of sacrifice is rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;14</a>. Had this altar been for offerings, it would violate that command (see also <a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8&#8211;9</a>).

Literally, the <span class="accented">circles</span> (cf. notes on Joshua 13:2; 18:17; 20:7; 21:32). Conder suggests <span class="accented">downs</span>, and it is most probable that the word refers to curved outlines, such as we frequently see in the hollows of our own chalk downs, or in any place where the strata do not yield easily to the action of water, and yet have been moulded by such action. <span class="cmt_word">That are in the land of Canaan.</span> Again the intention is to lay stress upon the fact that the historian is still speaking of the country west of Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">A great altar to see to.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">an altar great to sight, i.e.</span>, large and visible from a great distance. Bishop Horsley, however, would render a great altar <span class="accented">in appearance</span>, supposing that what is meant is that it only looked like an altar, and was not intended to be used as one. One of the most valuable results of the Palestine exploration movement has been the discovery of the site of this altar, which seems probable, in spite of Lieutenant Conder's abandonment of the theory in his 'Tent Work in Palestine,' 2:53. The reasons for the identification are as follows. The altar must be near one of the fords of Jordan. It must be on this side of Jordan (see note on vers. 24, 25). It must be in a conspicuous position, as we have just seen. Now Kurn Sartabeh or Surtubeh (see note on Joshua 3:16), visible from a great distance on all sides, from Ebal, from near Gennesaret, thirty miles off, from the Dead Sea, from the eastern high lands, and from the Judaean watershed (see Quarterly Paper of the Palestine Exploration Fund, Oct. 1874), fulfils all these conditions. Dr. Hutchinson replies (Quarterly Paper, Jan. 1876) that the altar is stated by Josephus to have been on the east side of Jordan, and that it was improbable that the two and a half tribes would have erected the altar on the cis-Jordanic territory, or so near to Shiloh, because Ephraim would have resented this. Moreover, the words, "a great altar <span class="accented">to be seen,"</span> would imply that it was to be visible from a long distance, so that the two tribes and a half might see it from their side of Jordan. It must be confessed that the evidence for the identification is but slight, but so also are the arguments against it. For <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Josephus is not infallible, and the Hebrew text seems to assert the very opposite of what he says. And <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the other tribes <span class="accented">did</span> resent the erection of the altar. Lieutenant Conder now admits that it is possible that the words stating that the tribes crossed "by the passage of the children of Israel "(ver. 11, but see note there) leads to the idea that the ford by Jericho is meant, and not the Damieh ford by Kurn Sartabeh. See, however, the translation given below. The fact that the Arabs call the place the ascent of the father of Ayd, which has a close resemblance to the Hebrew word <span class="accented">Ed</span>, "witness," does not appear conclusive, though it lends some degree of probability to the theory. On the other hand, it might be contended that if the Reubenites and Gadites had not erected the altar on their own territory, it would not have excited the wrath of the remaining tribes. But as the best authorities are content to leave the matter uncertain, it must be left uncertain here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/22-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when they came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
