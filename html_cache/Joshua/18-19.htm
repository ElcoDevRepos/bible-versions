It is situated near the Jordan River and the Dead Sea, indicating its strategic importance. The name "Beth-hoglah" means "house of the partridge," which may suggest a place known for wildlife or hunting. This area is significant in the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel, highlighting the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The precise location of Beth-hoglah is debated, but it is generally associated with the modern site of Ain Hajla.<p><b>and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea</b><br>The Salt Sea, known today as the Dead Sea, is a significant geographical landmark in the biblical narrative. It is the lowest point on Earth's surface and is known for its high salinity. The reference to the "northern bay" indicates the specific area where the border of the tribal allotment meets the sea. The Dead Sea is often associated with the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19), serving as a reminder of God's righteousness and justice. The mention of the Salt Sea in the context of land division underscores the tangible reality of the Israelites' inheritance.<p><b>at the mouth of the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River is a central feature in the biblical landscape, symbolizing transition and new beginnings. It is the river that the Israelites crossed to enter the Promised Land (Joshua 3-4), and it is also where Jesus was baptized, marking the beginning of His public ministry (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). The "mouth of the Jordan" refers to the point where the river flows into the Dead Sea. This location is significant as it represents the boundary of the land given to the tribe of Benjamin, emphasizing the importance of water sources in defining territorial limits.<p><b>This was the southern border</b><br>The delineation of borders was crucial for the organization and governance of the Israelite tribes. The southern border of Benjamin's territory is described here, providing clarity and order in the distribution of the land. This demarcation reflects the fulfillment of God's covenant promises and the establishment of Israel as a nation. The careful description of borders in the biblical text underscores the importance of land in the identity and heritage of the people of Israel. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness in providing for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-hoglah.htm">Beth-hoglah</a></b><br>A location in the territory of Benjamin, near the Jordan River.
