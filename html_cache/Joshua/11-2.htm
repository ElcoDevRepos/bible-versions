The "north" indicates regions north of the central Canaanite territories. The "mountains" likely refer to the mountainous regions of Upper Galilee. These areas were known for their strategic military advantage and difficult terrain, which provided natural fortifications. Historically, these kings would have been part of smaller city-states, each with its own ruler, forming alliances to resist the advancing Israelites.<p><b>in the Arabah south of Chinnereth</b><br>The "Arabah" is a term used for the Jordan Rift Valley, a significant geographical feature running from the Sea of Galilee (Chinnereth) to the Dead Sea. "South of Chinnereth" indicates the area south of the Sea of Galilee, a fertile region crucial for agriculture and trade. This area was significant in biblical history, as it was part of the land promised to the Israelites. The mention of Chinnereth connects to the Sea of Galilee, a site of many of Jesus' future miracles and teachings.<p><b>in the foothills</b><br>The "foothills" refer to the Shephelah, a region of low hills between the coastal plain and the central highlands of Israel. This area was known for its fertile land and was often contested by various groups throughout biblical history. The Shephelah served as a buffer zone and was strategically important for controlling access to the interior of the land. It was a place of frequent conflict, as seen in the battles between the Israelites and the Philistines.<p><b>and in Naphoth-dor to the west</b><br>"Naphoth-dor" refers to the region around the ancient city of Dor, located on the Mediterranean coast. This area was known for its harbors and trade routes, making it economically significant. The "west" indicates its coastal location, which was crucial for maritime trade and cultural exchanges. Dor was a Canaanite city that later became a significant site during the reign of King Solomon, who used it as one of his administrative districts. The mention of this region highlights the comprehensive nature of the conquest, reaching from the mountains to the sea.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_the_north.htm">Kings of the North</a></b><br>These were the rulers of various city-states in the northern region of Canaan.

Think of steep ridges, thick forests, and strategic passes.<p>&#8226; Scripture presents these heights as daunting, yet never beyond the reach of the LORD&#8217;s promise. Earlier, Caleb eyed Hebron&#8217;s mountains with confidence because &#8220;the LORD will be with me&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>).

The word Arabah is given untranslated in <a href="/joshua/18-18.htm">Joshua 18:18</a>. This was, no doubt, the great Ghor, or depression of the Jordan, or at least the northern part of it, extending for some distance south of the town of Chinneroth (<a href="/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>). This town gave its name to the lake or inland sea now better known to the student of Scriptures as the sea of Tiberias, or lake of Gennesareth (see <a href="/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>). "As we enter upon the geological character of the basin which contains the sea of Galilee, we see at once that it is simply one element of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea, which extends due north and south for a distance of sixty hours. This is the Ghor, or Sunken Valley of the Arabah" (see note on Joshua 3:16)," extending from Hasbeya to the AElanitic gulf as a continuous cleft - the deepest one known to us" (Ritter, 2:241). He goes on to enumerate the various signs of volcanic agency in this region; the frequent earthquakes, the form of the basin of Gennesareth (though he denies it to be a crater), the hot springs, the frequent eaves, the naphtha deposits and springs, the hot water springs to be found even in the Dead Sea, the lofty crystalline masses of the Sinaitic peninsula, and the porphyritic dykes found at the southern end Of the Ghor, as well as the general conformation of the country east of Jordan. The sea of Chinneroth, or Tiberias, is stated by Conder (Handbook, pp. 212, 216) to be 682.5 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. And in the valley.

This elevated position was a remarkable feature of the neighbourhood, though the various translations of the word (as "coast," <a href="/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a>; "region," <a href="/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>) rather obscure the prominence given to this physical characteristic in the Scripture narrative.

Thus situated, its position on a hill, though the hill is not a lofty one, would strike the observer, and it accounts for the peculiar form of speech noticed above, which is so common that in the LXX. it is usually given as part of the proper name, <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span>, ch. 12:23; <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span>, <a href="/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>). And behind it are still higher rocky ridges, to which the name also applies. Dor, with its excellent harbour, was a noted place of commerce in ancient times, especially in the <span class="accented">murex coccineus</span>, from which the far famed Tyrian dye was obtained. These are a species of mussel, and Seetzen mentions two varieties, the <span class="accented">murex trunculus</span> of Linnaeus, and the <span class="accented">Helix ianthina.</span> The latter is of a whitish green, but when taken out of the water it passes from red to purple, and after death to violet. Its use has been superseded by that of the cochineal insect, but the Tyrian purple was in great demand in early times. Its costliness may be inferred from the fact that in each insect a little pouch behind the head, not the size of a pea, contains the dye. See Ritter, 4:280, 281; Pliny, ' Nat. Hist.' 9, 36 (60 in some editions); and' Epist.' 50, 10, 26. The allusions to it by Horace, Virgil, Juvenal, and other classical authors are too numerous for quotation. We may take as instances Virgil, Georg. 3:17: "Illi victor ego, et Tyrio conspectus in ostro" (cf. AEn. 4:262): and Juvenal, Sat. 7:134; "Spondet enim Tyrio stlataria purpura filo." The ruins of the ancient city still crown the steeps of its site (see Vandevelde's Memoir, and Conder's Handbook. Also Keil <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">.<span class="cmt_word"></span> On the west</span>. The LXX. renders, "And to the Amorites on the sea coast" (see last note), leaving out all mention of the Canaanites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/11-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
