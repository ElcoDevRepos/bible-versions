This action is significant because it demonstrates a moment of human error, as Joshua and the Israelites did not seek God's counsel before making this decision (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>). The treaty was made under the guise of deception, as the Gibeonites pretended to be from a distant land. This reflects the importance of discernment and reliance on divine guidance. Theologically, it underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and the consequences of acting independently of His will.<p><b>to let them live</b><br>The decision to let the Gibeonites live was contrary to the command given to Israel to destroy the inhabitants of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This phrase highlights the mercy extended to the Gibeonites, albeit through deceit. It also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant community, a theme that is fully realized in the New Testament with the inclusion of all nations through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>).<p><b>and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them</b><br>The leaders of Israel, representing the entire congregation, bound themselves with an oath, which was a serious and binding commitment in ancient Near Eastern culture. This oath was made in the name of the Lord, making it irrevocable despite the deception involved (<a href="/joshua/9-19.htm">Joshua 9:19-20</a>). The importance of keeping one's word, especially when made before God, is emphasized throughout Scripture (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>). This incident also serves as a reminder of the power and sanctity of oaths and covenants, pointing to the ultimate covenant fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the faithful and true witness (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.

Despite Israel&#8217;s clear mandate in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a> to &#8220;make no covenant with them,&#8221; the leaders act without first seeking the LORD (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>). Yet Scripture records the act plainly, underscoring two truths:<p>&#8226;The Word faithfully reports even the missteps of God&#8217;s people, showing us both their frailty and His faithfulness (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226;Once spoken, a covenant carries weight before the LORD, as later affirmed when King Saul&#8217;s breach of this very treaty brings famine on the land (<a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>We are reminded that zeal or apparent prudence must never substitute for prayerful dependence on God (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to let them live</b><p>The core purpose of the treaty is preservation of life. While the Gibeonites deserved judgment under the ban (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>), they receive mercy&#8212;foreshadowing God&#8217;s heart to spare those who seek refuge (<a href="/joshua/9-25.htm">Joshua 9:25</a>). This does not negate justice; the Gibeonites become &#8220;hewers of wood and drawers of water&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>), servants to the sanctuary. Mercy and consequence coexist, reflecting the balance seen when cities outside Canaan could be spared upon surrender (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10&#8211;11</a>). In the larger storyline, God&#8217;s grace always finds a way to rescue the undeserving&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who offers life to all who come (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them</b><p>The public oath elevates the agreement from personal promise to covenant before God. <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> warns that &#8220;a man... shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth,&#8221; and <a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a> commends the one &#8220;who keeps his oath even when it hurts.&#8221; Centuries later, Israel honors this covenant despite national cost, proving that words spoken in God&#8217;s name are binding (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;5</a>). The episode teaches:<p>&#8226;Leadership is accountable for its words; rash vows carry lasting consequences.<p>&#8226;God expects His people to reflect His integrity, modeling fidelity in a culture where promises are easily broken (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-15.htm">Joshua 9:15</a> captures the tension between human error and divine expectation. The leaders, neglecting to inquire of the LORD, enter a binding covenant, yet God upholds the sanctity of their word. Through this single verse we see the high value Scripture places on integrity, the surprising reach of mercy, and the sober call to seek God first in every decision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The princes of the congregation.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">the exalted ones</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> of the congregation, "Die obersten der gemeine" (Luther);
