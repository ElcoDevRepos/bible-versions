This tribe settled in the northern part of Canaan, an area known for its fertile land and strategic location. The allocation of cities to the Levites from Naphtali's territory reflects the tribe's role in supporting the religious and spiritual life of Israel.<p><b>they were given Kedesh in Galilee</b><br>Kedesh was a significant city in the region of Galilee, which later became a central area in Jesus' ministry. The name "Kedesh" means "holy" or "sacred," indicating its importance. It was strategically located and served as a Levitical city, providing a place for the Levites to live and serve. Galilee's mention here foreshadows its future prominence in the New Testament.<p><b>(a city of refuge for the manslayer)</b><br>Cities of refuge were established to provide asylum for individuals who committed unintentional manslaughter. This system reflects God's justice and mercy, ensuring protection for those who accidentally caused death, while awaiting a fair trial. The concept of refuge is a type of Christ, who offers spiritual refuge and salvation to all who seek Him.<p><b>Hammoth-dor</b><br>Hammoth-dor, also known as Hammath, was another city allocated to the Levites. Its name suggests the presence of hot springs, which were common in the region. The city's inclusion in the Levitical cities highlights the distribution of religious responsibilities across Israel, ensuring that the Levites were present throughout the land to teach and guide the people.<p><b>and Kartan</b><br>Kartan, though less prominent in biblical records, was part of the Levitical cities given to the tribe of Naphtali. Its mention underscores the comprehensive nature of the Levitical distribution, ensuring that every tribe contributed to the spiritual leadership of the nation.<p><b>three cities, together with their pasturelands</b><br>The allocation of pasturelands with these cities was essential for the Levites, who did not receive a tribal inheritance of land like the other tribes. These lands provided for their livestock and sustenance, allowing them to focus on their religious duties.
