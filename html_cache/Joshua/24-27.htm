Joshua, as Moses' successor, is addressing the entire assembly of Israel, emphasizing the communal nature of the covenant. This setting is reminiscent of other covenant renewals in the Old Testament, such as those led by Moses.<p><b>&#8220;You see this stone.</b><br>Stones were often used in ancient times as memorials or witnesses to significant events. In the biblical context, stones served as physical reminders of God's promises and the people's commitments. This stone is a tangible symbol of the covenant made at Shechem, a place with historical significance for Israel, as it was where God first promised the land to Abraham.<p><b>It will be a witness against us,</b><br>The concept of a stone as a witness is symbolic, representing the permanence and unchanging nature of the covenant. In the ancient Near East, witnesses were crucial in legal agreements, and invoking a stone as a witness underscores the seriousness of the commitment. This idea is echoed in other parts of Scripture, where creation itself is called to witness human actions (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p><b>for it has heard all the words the LORD has spoken to us,</b><br>This phrase personifies the stone, attributing to it the ability to "hear" the covenant words. It underscores the belief that all creation is under God's authority and can serve His purposes. The words of the LORD refer to the covenant stipulations and blessings and curses outlined in the law, which the people have agreed to uphold.<p><b>and it will be a witness against you</b><br>The repetition of the stone as a witness emphasizes accountability. The Israelites are reminded that their commitment to God is not just a personal or private matter but a public and communal one. This accountability is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God often calls His people to remember their vows and the consequences of breaking them.<p><b>if you ever deny your God.&#8221;</b><br>This conditional statement highlights the potential for apostasy and the serious consequences of turning away from God. The warning serves as a reminder of the covenant's demands and the importance of faithfulness. Throughout Scripture, the theme of remaining true to God is central, with numerous examples of both faithfulness and failure among God's people. This phrase also foreshadows the challenges Israel will face in maintaining their covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who guided the Israelites into the Promised Land and led them in renewing their covenant with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are gathered to renew their covenant with the LORD at Shechem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stone.htm">The Stone</a></b><br>A physical monument set up by Joshua to serve as a witness to the covenant between God and the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The location where the covenant renewal ceremony took place, a significant site in Israel's history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who has spoken to His people and established a covenant with them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reminders.htm">The Importance of Reminders</a></b><br>Physical reminders, like the stone, help us remember our commitments to God and His faithfulness to us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses_to_our_faith.htm">Witnesses to Our Faith</a></b><br>Just as the stone was a witness, our lives and actions serve as witnesses to our faith in God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_renewal.htm">Covenant Renewal</a></b><br>Regularly renewing our commitment to God is vital for maintaining a strong relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability.htm">Accountability</a></b><br>The stone serves as a reminder that we are accountable to God for our actions and promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>The stone "heard" the words of the LORD, emphasizing the enduring power and presence of God's word in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_24_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 24:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_24_27_Remember_God_s_covenant.htm">How does Joshua 24:27 emphasize the importance of remembering God's covenant with Israel?

Joshua&#8217;s address underscores that no one in the community can claim ignorance of what is about to be agreed upon.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You see this stone</b><p>Joshua points to a visible, tangible object. &#8226; Israel had already set stones from the Jordan as a memorial so &#8220;all the peoples of the earth may know&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/4-5.htm">Joshua 4:5-7</a>). &#8226; Jacob and Laban piled stones as a witness (<a href="/genesis/31-45.htm">Genesis 31:45-48</a>). &#8226; Samuel later sets up Ebenezer saying, &#8220;Thus far the LORD has helped us&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>). In each case, God&#8217;s people use ordinary materials to mark extraordinary moments, turning everyday objects into continual reminders of divine faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It will be a witness against us</b><p>By calling the stone a witness, Joshua taps into a legal framework: witnesses confirm facts and enforce accountability. &#8226; Moses placed &#8220;this book of the law&#8221; beside the ark &#8220;as a witness against you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26-29</a>). &#8226; Even creation bears witness; the moon is described as &#8220;a faithful witness in the sky&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>). When believers set up memorials, they invite God&#8217;s own courtroom standard into daily life, acknowledging that His testimony overrules ours.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for it has heard all the words the LORD has spoken to us</b><p>Joshua personifies the stone, yet Scripture often invites creation to participate in covenant drama. &#8226; &#8220;Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>). &#8226; &#8220;Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>). &#8226; Jesus said that if the disciples kept silent, &#8220;the stones will cry out&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>). By faith we accept that the physical world, created by God&#8217;s word (<a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>), stands ready to affirm that word whenever human hearts drift toward forgetfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it will be a witness against you if you ever deny your God.</b><p>The warning is as clear as the promise. &#8226; Moses cautioned, &#8220;Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23-27</a>). &#8226; The angel at Bochim later rebukes Israel for covenant breach (<a href="/judges/2-2.htm">Judges 2:2-3</a>). &#8226; In the New Testament, Paul warns, &#8220;If we deny Him, He also will deny us&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>), and Hebrews adds, &#8220;See to it that you do not refuse Him who speaks&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>). The stone therefore stands both as comfort when we obey and indictment when we rebel, reinforcing that God&#8217;s covenant is irrevocably binding.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/24-27.htm">Joshua 24:27</a> establishes a solemn memorial that turns a simple stone into a courtroom witness. By assembling the whole community, pointing to a visible marker, invoking legal language, appealing to creation&#8217;s testimony, and issuing a sober warning, Joshua impresses on Israel&#8212;and on us&#8212;that God&#8217;s covenant demands wholehearted, lifelong allegiance. The stone silently proclaims: the LORD has spoken, we have agreed, and heaven and earth stand ready to confirm every word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A witness</span> (see note on Joshua 22:27). <span class="cmt_word">For it hath heard.</span> Joshua speaks by a poetical figure of the stone, as though it had intelligence. The stone was taken from the very place where they stood, and within earshot of the words which had been spoken. Thus it became a more forcible memorial of what had occurred than if it had been brought from far. Ye deny your God. To deny is to say that He is not. The Hebrew implies "to deny <span class="accented">concerning</span> Him," to contest the truth of what has been revealed of His essence, and to disparage or deny the great things He had done for His people. The whole scene must have been a striking one. The aged warrior, full of years and honours, venerable from his piety and courage and implicit obedience, addresses in the measured, perhaps tremulous, accents of age the representatives of the whole people he has led so long and so well. Around him are the ancient memories of his race. Here Abraham pitched his tent in his wanderings through Canaan. Here was the first altar built to the worship of the one true God of the land. Here Jacob had buried the teraphim, and solemnly engaged his household in the worship of the true God. Here was the second foothold the children of Abraham obtained in the promised land (see ver. 32), a foretaste of their future inheritance. The bare heights of Ebal soared above them on one side, the softer outlines of Gerizim rose above them on the other; and on their sides, the plaster fresh and the letters distinct and clear, were to be seen the blessings and the curses foretold of those who kept and those who broke the law. In the midst, Shechem, in a situation, as we have seen, of rare beauty, bore witness to the fulfilment of God's promise that the land of their inheritance should be "a good land," a "land flowing with milk and honey." No other place could combine so many solemn memories; none could more adequately remind them of the fulness of blessing God had in store for those who would obey His word; none could be fitter to impress upon them the duty of worshipping God, and Him alone. <p> CHAPTER 24:29-33.
