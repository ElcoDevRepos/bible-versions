In the context of <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>, Rahab's house serves as a sanctuary during the impending destruction of Jericho. This mirrors the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, where the Israelites were instructed to stay indoors with the blood of the lamb on their doorposts to be spared from the angel of death. The concept of a place of refuge is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing God's protection for those who obey His instructions.<p><b>his blood will be on his own head</b><br>This expression indicates personal responsibility for one's actions. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the phrase "blood on one's head" signifies accountability for one's own death due to disobedience or negligence. This principle is echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/33-4.htm">Ezekiel 33:4</a>, where the watchman warns the people, and those who ignore the warning bear their own guilt. It underscores the biblical theme of individual responsibility before God.<p><b>and we will be innocent</b><br>The spies' declaration of innocence reflects a legal and moral release from guilt. In the covenantal context, they are bound to protect Rahab and her family only if the conditions are met. This reflects the biblical principle of conditional covenants, where blessings and protection are contingent upon obedience. The spies' promise is reminiscent of the covenantal faithfulness God expects from His people.<p><b>But if a hand is laid on anyone with you in the house</b><br>This phrase underscores the assurance of protection for those who remain within the designated safe zone. It highlights the seriousness of the spies' oath to Rahab, ensuring her safety as part of their agreement. This protection is reminiscent of the cities of refuge described in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>, where individuals could find safety from avengers. It also foreshadows the ultimate protection found in Christ, who offers refuge to all who come to Him.<p><b>his blood will be on our heads</b><br>Here, the spies take on the responsibility for any harm that befalls Rahab's family if they remain in the house. This reflects the biblical principle of bearing one another's burdens, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>. It also illustrates the concept of substitutionary atonement, where one party takes on the consequences for another's safety, pointing to Christ's sacrifice on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho who hid the Israelite spies.
