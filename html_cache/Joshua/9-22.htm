This reflects his role as a judge and leader, responsible for maintaining the covenant integrity of Israel. The Gibeonites were a group of Hivites, one of the Canaanite tribes, who lived in the region of Gibeon, a city located northwest of Jerusalem. This summoning indicates a formal inquiry, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures when addressing grievances or breaches of agreements.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Why did you deceive us</b><br>The act of deception by the Gibeonites is central to this narrative. In the ancient world, deception was often used as a survival tactic, especially by weaker parties facing stronger adversaries. The Gibeonites' deception involved pretending to be from a distant land to secure a peace treaty with Israel, as they feared the fate of other Canaanite cities. This question by Joshua highlights the moral and ethical expectations within covenant relationships, where honesty and transparency were paramount.<p><b>by telling us you live far away from us,</b><br>The Gibeonites claimed to be from a distant land, which was a strategic lie to avoid the fate of other Canaanite cities that were being conquered by Israel. This phrase underscores the geographical and political dynamics of the time. The Israelites were commanded by God to conquer the land of Canaan and not to make treaties with its inhabitants (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). By claiming to be from afar, the Gibeonites sought to circumvent this divine mandate.<p><b>when in fact you live among us?</b><br>The revelation that the Gibeonites lived nearby is significant. It highlights the proximity of Gibeon to the Israelite camp at Gilgal, emphasizing the immediacy of the threat perceived by the Gibeonites. This phrase also reflects the broader theme of the Israelites' journey into the Promised Land, where they encountered various peoples and cultures. The Gibeonites' integration into Israelite society, despite their deception, foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God, a theme that is fully realized in the New Testament with the spread of the Gospel to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.
