The context is the southern campaign of the Israelites, where Joshua leads the conquest of Canaan. The capture of these kings signifies a pivotal moment in the military campaign, demonstrating God's deliverance of Israel's enemies into their hands. Historically, capturing enemy kings was a significant victory, symbolizing the defeat of their entire nation.<p><b>he summoned all the men of Israel</b><br>Joshua's summoning of all the men of Israel underscores the communal nature of Israel's military efforts and the shared responsibility in fulfilling God's command to conquer the land. It also serves as a public demonstration of God's power and faithfulness to His promises. This act reinforces the unity and collective identity of the Israelites as God's chosen people.<p><b>and said to the army commanders who had accompanied him</b><br>Joshua addresses the leaders who have been with him throughout the campaign. These commanders represent the military leadership and are instrumental in executing the strategies that lead to victory. Their presence highlights the importance of leadership and obedience in achieving God's purposes. This moment also serves as a teaching opportunity for these leaders, emphasizing reliance on God's guidance.<p><b>&#8220;Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.&#8221;</b><br>This act is symbolic of complete victory and subjugation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, placing one's foot on the neck of a defeated enemy was a common practice to demonstrate dominance and triumph. It signifies the total defeat of the enemy and the authority of the victor. Biblically, this act foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over His enemies, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where God says to the Messiah, "Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."<p><b>So the commanders came forward and put their feet on their necks.</b><br>The obedience of the commanders in carrying out Joshua's command reflects their trust in his leadership and God's promises. This act of placing their feet on the necks of the kings serves as a tangible reminder of God's deliverance and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel. It also prefigures the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ over sin and death, as He will one day put all His enemies under His feet, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kings.htm">The Kings</a></b><br>Five Amorite kings who formed an alliance against Gibeon and were defeated by Joshua and the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commanders_of_the_troops.htm">The Commanders of the Troops</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelite army who were called by Joshua to participate in the symbolic act of victory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, represented by its army and leaders in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>A city that made a treaty with Israel and was attacked by the Amorite kings, prompting Israel's defense.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_victory.htm">Symbol of Victory</a></b><br>The act of placing feet on the necks of the kings is a powerful symbol of God's deliverance and victory over enemies.

Keil thinks that it is a sort of intermediate step between the more ancient termination <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> and the more modern one in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. But if so, it is strange that we should only meet with it twice in Holy Scripture. Haverniek (Introduction, &sect; 22 B) regards it as an archaic form. <span class="cmt_word">Put your feet on the necks of these kings.</span> This was a most common Oriental practice, as the Assyrian and Egyptian monuments prove. Calvin explains the otherwise "boundless arrogance" of the act by the Divine command. But, as Keil remarks, it was a "symbolical act, intended to inspirit the people." See also <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>. The fact that this was done, not by Joshua, but by the captains (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>; from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> to cut off), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the inferior officers of the Israelitish army, makes a wide distinction between this and the usual arrogance of Oriental conquerors, and marks the very great moral superiority of Joshua over any other leader known to history either in his own time or in subsequent ages. For whereas the act was usually an act of arrogant triumph on the part of the leader himself, here the leader modestly disclaims any such superiority, and calls upon his subordinates to assume it, as a sign that the Israelitish people, whose representatives they were, <span class="accented">should</span> triumph over all their enemies. The next verse explains the reason of the injunction. To the kings themselves no insolence was displayed, for it was but the well known and perfectly understood symbol of their undeniable condition of subjection at that moment. But, of course, we are not to look for that gentleness and humanity in so far distant an age, which would at the present day be shown by a Christian general, or even for the moderation and clemency displayed in the hour of victory by an Alexander, a Scipio, a Caesar, trained under the maxims of Latin and Greek philosophy. See a fuller discussion of the subject in the Introduction. Origen remarks here, "Atque utinam Dominus meus Jesus filius Dei mihi istud concedat, et jubeat me pedibus meis conculcare spiritum fornicationis, et caleare super cervices spiritus iracundise et furoris, calcare avaritise daemonem, caicare jactantiam, conterere pedibus superbiae spiritum." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When they had brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1469;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1464;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
