The LORD's deliverance is a recurring theme in the book of Joshua, highlighting that the victories of Israel are attributed to God's power rather than human strength. This reflects the covenantal promise given to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) and the assurance given to Joshua at the beginning of his leadership (<a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3-5</a>). The city referred to here is Libnah, a Canaanite city-state, which, like others in the region, was part of the land promised to the Israelites.<p><b>and Joshua put all the people to the sword, leaving no survivors</b><br>This phrase describes the complete destruction of the inhabitants of Libnah, a practice known as herem, or the ban, which was commanded by God for certain cities (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>). This was intended to prevent the Israelites from being influenced by the idolatrous practices of the Canaanites. The total destruction also served as a form of divine judgment against the Canaanites for their sins (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). This action is often seen as a type of final judgment, prefiguring the ultimate judgment of God against sin.<p><b>And he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho</b><br>This phrase draws a parallel between the fate of the king of Libnah and the king of Jericho. The king of Jericho was executed after the city's fall (<a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>), symbolizing the complete overthrow of Canaanite authority and the establishment of Israelite control. The repetition of this action underscores the consistency of God's judgment and the fulfillment of His promises. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of opposing God's will, as seen in the broader narrative of the conquest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

This pattern of divine initiative&#8212;God handing over kings and cities&#8212;repeats throughout the conquest (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; 8:1; 10:8; 24:12), underscoring that Israel&#8217;s success rests on covenant faithfulness, not military prowess.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;also delivered&#8221; links Libnah to the earlier towns already conquered, showing a steady fulfillment of <a href="/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>, where God vowed to &#8220;deliver their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Joshua put all the people to the sword, leaving no survivors</b><p>&#8226;

Similar total destruction occurred at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>) and Ai (8:24&#8211;26), highlighting consistent obedience.<p>&#8226; The complete removal of inhabitants mirrored God&#8217;s earlier judgments in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a> and <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24&#8211;25</a>, where the sin of the Amorites reached full measure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho</b><p>&#8226; Executing the king (cf. <a href="/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26&#8211;27</a>) publicly demonstrated that no earthly authority could stand against the Lord (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jericho&#8217;s king had been similarly dealt with (<a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21, 24</a>), setting a precedent of decisive justice against persistent rebellion (<a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55&#8211;56</a>).<p>&#8226; The chaining of victories&#8212;Jericho, Ai, the five Amorite kings, and now Libnah&#8212;illustrates the momentum of God&#8217;s judgment and Israel&#8217;s obedience (<a href="/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/10-30.htm">Joshua 10:30</a> records another step in God&#8217;s unstoppable campaign to give Israel the land.
