Dan's territory was located in the central coastal region of Canaan, which included fertile lands but also faced challenges from neighboring Philistine territories. The tribe of Dan is known for its struggles to fully possess its allotted land, as seen in <a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>, where the Amorites forced the Danites into the hill country. This context highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the Israelites in securing their inheritance.<p><b>they were given</b><br>This phrase refers to the allocation of cities to the Levites, who were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a contiguous territory like the other tribes. Instead, they were given specific cities within the territories of other tribes. This distribution ensured that the Levites were spread throughout Israel, facilitating their role in teaching the Law and maintaining the spiritual life of the nation. The allocation of cities to the Levites fulfilled the command in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>, where God instructed Moses to provide cities for the Levites.<p><b>Elteke</b><br>Elteke was one of the cities given to the Levites from the tribe of Dan. Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the Shephelah, the lowland region of Judah. This area was strategically important, serving as a buffer zone between the coastal plains and the hill country. The mention of Elteke in <a href="/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a> as part of Dan's inheritance underscores the integration of the Levites into the broader community of Israel, ensuring their presence and influence across the land.<p><b>Gibbethon</b><br>Gibbethon was another city allocated to the Levites from the tribe of Dan. It is mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27 and 16</a>:15 as a site of conflict between Israel and the Philistines, indicating its strategic importance. The city's location in the territory of Dan highlights the ongoing tension between the Israelites and their Philistine neighbors. The presence of Levites in Gibbethon would have provided spiritual support and guidance to the Israelites in this contested region, reinforcing the role of the Levites as spiritual leaders and mediators.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_dan.htm">Tribe of Dan</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Dan, the fifth son of Jacob and Bilhah.
