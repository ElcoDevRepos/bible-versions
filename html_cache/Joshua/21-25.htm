One half settled on the east side of the Jordan River, while the other half settled on the west. This allocation reflects the fulfillment of the promise given to Joseph's descendants, highlighting the importance of inheritance and land distribution among the tribes of Israel. The division also underscores the unity and diversity within the nation of Israel.<p><b>they were given Taanach and Gath-rimmon</b><br>Taanach and Gath-rimmon were cities allocated to the Levites, specifically the Kohathite clan, as part of their inheritance. Taanach is located in the Jezreel Valley, a fertile and strategic area, often associated with significant biblical battles, such as those involving Deborah and Barak (Judges 5). Gath-rimmon, though less frequently mentioned, was also a Levitical city, emphasizing the provision for the Levites who served in religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. The allocation of these cities to the Levites underscores the importance of supporting those dedicated to spiritual leadership and worship.<p><b>two cities, together with their pasturelands</b><br>The mention of pasturelands indicates the practical needs of the Levites, who required land for their livestock and sustenance. This provision ensured that the Levites could maintain their livelihood while focusing on their religious responsibilities. The inclusion of pasturelands with the cities highlights the comprehensive care God provided for the Levites, ensuring they had both a place to live and resources to sustain themselves. This arrangement reflects the broader biblical principle of God's provision for His people and the importance of supporting those who serve in ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Half-Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Manasseh, the son of Joseph.
