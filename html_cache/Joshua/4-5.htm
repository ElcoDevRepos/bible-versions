Joshua, as the leader appointed by God after Moses, often communicated God's instructions to the people. This reflects the biblical principle of leadership and obedience to divine authority.<p><b>&#8220;Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant symbolizes God's presence among His people. Crossing before the Ark signifies the Israelites' faith and trust in God's guidance and protection. The Ark leading the way is a recurring theme, emphasizing God's leadership in their journey. This mirrors the crossing of the Red Sea, where God's presence led the Israelites to safety.<p><b>into the middle of the Jordan.</b><br>The Jordan River represents a significant geographical and spiritual boundary. Crossing it marks the transition from the wilderness into the Promised Land. The miraculous parting of the Jordan, similar to the Red Sea, demonstrates God's power and faithfulness. The middle of the Jordan is a place of divine intervention, where natural laws are suspended for God's purposes.<p><b>Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder,</b><br>The act of taking a stone is symbolic and serves as a physical reminder of God's deliverance. Carrying the stone on the shoulder indicates the weight and significance of the task. This action is a memorial for future generations, teaching them about God's mighty works. It also foreshadows the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone, a foundation of faith.<p><b>according to the number of the tribes of Israel,</b><br>The twelve stones represent the twelve tribes of Israel, emphasizing unity and collective identity. This act reinforces the covenant relationship between God and His people. It also serves as a reminder of the promises made to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, regarding the land and their descendants. The number twelve often signifies completeness and God's divine order throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_lord.htm">The Ark of the LORD</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The river that the Israelites crossed to enter the Promised Land, symbolizing a transition from the wilderness to the fulfillment of God's promise.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve_tribes_of_israel.htm">The Twelve Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of the twelve sons of Jacob, each represented by a stone taken from the Jordan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_memorial_stones.htm">The Memorial Stones</a></b><br>Stones taken from the Jordan River to serve as a lasting memorial of God's faithfulness in bringing the Israelites into the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The stones serve as a tangible reminder of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.

By putting the ark first, the Lord was teaching that He leads His people and makes a way where there is none&#8212;just as He had done at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14-16</a>). The command underscores two timeless truths:<p>&#8226; God always precedes His people; we follow His lead, not the other way around (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience must be immediate; Israel was to &#8220;cross over&#8221; while the river was still a swollen torrent (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15-17</a>), a tangible act of faith rather than sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Into the middle of the Jordan</b><p>The phrase highlights that this was no symbolic gesture on the riverbank. The priests carrying the ark stood &#8220;firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>). The dry riverbed itself became a stage for God&#8217;s power, reminiscent of the dry land through the Red Sea. By entering the river&#8217;s heart, Israel witnessed a miracle they could never forget (<a href="/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5-6</a>). For believers today, it pictures the call to step into situations where only God can hold back the waters (<a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder</b><p>God turned the miracle into a memorial. Twelve men, one from every tribe, were to heft stones &#8220;upon his shoulder,&#8221; indicating sizable rocks, not pocket pebbles. Memorials in Scripture are physical reminders of spiritual realities&#8212;Noah&#8217;s altar after the flood (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20-21</a>), the Passover meal (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>), Samuel&#8217;s Ebenezer stone (<a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>). The weight on each man&#8217;s shoulder speaks of personal responsibility: every generation must carry and pass on the testimony of God&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to the number of the tribes of Israel</b><p>Twelve stones for twelve tribes proclaimed unity in diversity. All Israel crossed together, and all Israel would remember together. No tribe was left out or favored (<a href="/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>). The memorial preaches equality before the Lord and joint inheritance of His promises (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>). By tying the stones to tribal identity, God ensured that families would retell the story, weaving the miracle into the nation&#8217;s collective memory (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/4-5.htm">Joshua 4:5</a> commands Israel to follow God&#8217;s presence into impossible territory, seize tangible testimony of His deliverance, and preserve that testimony for every tribe and every generation. The verse reminds believers to step where God leads, shoulder the responsibility of remembering His works, and celebrate the unity of His redeemed people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and said to them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
