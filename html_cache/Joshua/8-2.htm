In the conquest of Jericho, the Israelites followed God's specific instructions, leading to the city's walls collapsing (Joshua 6). The destruction of Ai signifies God's continued support for Israel's conquest of Canaan. The king of Ai, like the king of Jericho, represents the leadership and power structure that opposes God's people. The defeat of these kings symbolizes the triumph of God's will over earthly powers.<p><b>except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves</b><br>Unlike Jericho, where the Israelites were commanded to devote everything to destruction and take nothing for themselves (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-19</a>), Ai's plunder and livestock were allowed to be taken. This change highlights God's provision for His people, rewarding their obedience and perseverance. It also reflects a shift in strategy, where God permits the Israelites to benefit materially from their conquests, which would have been crucial for sustaining the nation during their campaign.<p><b>Set up an ambush behind the city</b><br>The strategy of setting an ambush demonstrates a tactical approach to warfare, combining divine guidance with human ingenuity. This military tactic contrasts with the miraculous fall of Jericho, showing that God works through both supernatural and natural means. The ambush required careful planning and execution, emphasizing the importance of obedience and trust in God's instructions. This strategy also foreshadows the cunning and wisdom that would characterize many of Israel's future battles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, appointed by God to succeed Moses and lead the people into the Promised Land.
