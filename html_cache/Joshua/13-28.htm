The allocation of land to the Gadites was part of the broader division of Canaan among the tribes of Israel, as commanded by God to Moses and later executed by Joshua. This inheritance was on the east side of the Jordan River, in the region known as Gilead. The Gadites, along with the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, chose to settle in this area because of its suitability for their large herds and flocks. This decision is recorded in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>, where Moses grants their request on the condition that they assist in the conquest of Canaan. The inheritance signifies God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to the patriarchs regarding the land.<p><b>including the cities and villages</b><br>The mention of cities and villages indicates a well-established and organized settlement pattern. The cities would have been fortified centers of administration and defense, while the villages were likely agricultural communities supporting the urban centers. This distribution reflects the socio-economic structure of ancient Israelite society, where agriculture was the primary occupation. The cities and villages in Gad's territory included notable locations such as Dibon, Ataroth, and Aroer, which are mentioned in other biblical passages. These sites have been subjects of archaeological interest, providing insights into the Iron Age culture and confirming biblical accounts. The allocation of cities and villages also underscores the importance of community and shared responsibility within the tribe, as each clan had its portion to manage and protect.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gadites.htm">Gadites</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Gad, the seventh son of Jacob and Zilpah.

While both inhabited a similar tract of country, a country from its open and pastoral character likely to develop a hardy and healthy race of men, the Reubenites were exposed to the seductions of the Moabitish worship of Chemosh, which, when combined with an ancestral temperament by no means prone to resist such influences (see <a href="/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), soon proved fatal to a tribe, itself not numerous (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>), and hemmed in on every side but the north by the unbelievers. The temperament inherited by the Gadites added to their more favourable situation and the nature of their pursuits, developed a hardy and warlike race ready to do battle, and fearless of their foes (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a>). Of this tribe came the valiant Jephthah, and of it also came the brave soldiers of David, whose qualifications stir to poetry the sober chronicler of Judah (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). We may see here the influence of circumstances on the character of a people. Originally (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a>) the Reubenites and the Gadites were alike. But the Reubenites, as we have seen, from unfavourable surroundings, lost the character which the Gadites, more favourably situated, were enabled to preserve. And the distinctions of tribes, producing as they did a separate <span class="accented">esprit de corps in</span> each tribe, will serve to explain why one tribe did not immediately succumb to influences which proved fatal to another. In the end, as we know, all the people of Gad fell victims to the temptations which surrounded them, and, save in the case of Levi, Judah, and Benjamin, and the few faithful Israelites who went over to them, irrevocably. The same phenomenon may be observed in the history of nations generally. As long as their manners were simple and their morals pure, they have preserved their liberty, and in many cases have acquired empire. As soon as their bodies were enervated by luxury, and their minds corrupted by vice, they fell a prey to foes whom formerly they would have despised. Thus fell the Greek and Boman republics, thus the Britons became an easy prey to the Saxons, and the Saxons to the Danes. In every instance the history of a tribe and of a nation serves to illustrate the maxim that "righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/13-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1435;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was the inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5159.htm">Strong's 5159: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something inherited, occupancy, an heirloom, an estate, patrimony, portion</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the clans</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4940.htm">Strong's 4940: </a> </span><span class="str2">A family, circle of relatives, a class, a species, sort, a tribe, people</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Gadites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">including the cities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and villages.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;a&#7779;&#183;r&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2691.htm">Strong's 2691: </a> </span><span class="str2">A yard, a hamlet</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/13-28.htm">OT History: Joshua 13:28 This is the inheritance of the children (Josh.
