This location is crucial as Jericho is the first major conquest in the Promised Land. The Israelites have crossed the Jordan River and are preparing for battle. Jericho's walls are famously formidable, and its defeat will demonstrate God's power and faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him</b><br>Joshua's encounter is unexpected and significant.

This imagery is reminiscent of the angel of the Lord who appeared to Balaam (<a href="/numbers/22-31.htm">Numbers 22:31</a>) and indicates divine intervention.

It also highlights the tension and uncertainty before the battle. The question sets the stage for the revelation that follows, emphasizing that God's purposes transcend human conflicts and alignments.

The drawn sword signals divine authority; Joshua&#8217;s approach models reverent boldness; his question exposes a common human desire to harness God for personal aims. The passage calls believers to align with God&#8217;s purposes, trust His word, and recognize that every battle is won when He goes before us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>THE CONQUEST OF CANAAN.</span><p>(13) At this point commences the second great division of the book. The Passage of Jordan was the great event of the first portion; and for that Joshua received special directions from Jehovah. A vision now appears to him, to inaugurate his second great enterprise, which was to put the inhabitants of Canaan to the sword. The character of this vision should be carefully noted, as it is of the utmost importance to the interpretation of the book.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">There stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand.</span>--This should be compared with the vision which Moses saw at Horeb (Exodus 3), when the angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. The equality of the two visions is proved by the use of the same command on both occasions, "Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm" title="And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place where on you stand is holy ground.">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-15.htm" title="And the captain of the LORD's host said to Joshua, Loose your shoe from off your foot; for the place where on you stand is holy. And Joshua did so.">Joshua 5:15</a>). But the actual appearances must be contrasted. "The bush burning with fire, but not consumed," presents to us the figure of suffering Israel in the furnace; and "in all their affliction He was afflicted, and the angel of <span class= "ital">His presence </span>saved them." The man with the drawn sword is the sign of victory. Jehovah no longer suffers with and in His people, but He stands forth to lead them with the drawn sword. In regard of this and earlier theophanies, see Excursus on Genesis 16.<p><span class= "bld">Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? (14) And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come</span>--i.e., Jehovah will take part in this conflict, <span class= "ital">not as an ally or an adversary, but as commander-in-chief. </span>It is not Israel's quarrel, in which they are to ask the Divine assistance. It is the Lord's own quarrel, and Israel and Joshua are but a division in His host. The wars of Israel in Canaan are always presented by the Old Testament as "the wars of the Lord." It would be well to remember this aspect of the story. The conquest of Canaan is too often treated as an enterprise of the Israelites, carried out with great cruelties, for which they claimed the Divine sanction. The Old Testament presents the matter in an entirely different light. The war is a Divine enterprise, in which human instruments are employed, but so as to be entirely subordinate to the Divine will. Jehovah is not for Israel, nor for Israel's foes. He fights for His own right hand, and Israel is but a fragment of His army. "The sun stood still." "the stars in their courses fought against" His foes. "The treasures of the hail" were opened, which He had "reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Joshua was by Jericho.</span> The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>, the principal meaning of which is <span class="accented">"in"</span> signifies here "in the immediate neighbourhood of," as in <a href="/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a> (where, however, the LXX. read <span class="accented">"in Endor"</span>), <a href="/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15</a>.
