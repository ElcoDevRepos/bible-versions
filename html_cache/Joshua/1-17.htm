Moses was a central figure in Israel's history, leading the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness. His leadership was marked by direct communication with God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where it is said that the LORD spoke to Moses face to face. The Israelites' commitment to obey Joshua as they did Moses signifies their recognition of Joshua's divinely appointed role. Historically, this transition of leadership was crucial for maintaining unity and direction as the Israelites prepared to enter the Promised Land. The phrase also underscores the importance of obedience to God's appointed leaders, a theme echoed in <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>, which calls for submission to those who lead in the faith.<p><b>And may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses.</b><br>This part of the verse is a prayer and a blessing, invoking God's presence with Joshua as it was with Moses. The presence of God with Moses was evident through numerous miracles and guidance, such as the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and the provision of manna (Exodus 16). The assurance of God's presence is a recurring theme in Scripture, providing strength and courage to His people. In the New Testament, Jesus promises His presence with His followers in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, "And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." This continuity of divine presence from Moses to Joshua, and ultimately to all believers through Christ, highlights the unchanging nature of God's faithfulness. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the conditional nature of God's blessings, often linked to obedience and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The successor of Moses, chosen to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land.

Their vow prepares them to act, not merely speak.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And may the LORD your God be with you</b><p>- The people acknowledge that Joshua&#8217;s success depends entirely on God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15-16</a>; <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>- By saying &#8220;your God,&#8221; they highlight Joshua&#8217;s personal walk with the LORD, inviting him to keep that relationship central (<a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>; <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>- Their words also function as an intercessory blessing, asking God to empower Joshua&#8217;s leadership (<a href="/2_samuel/7-29.htm">2 Samuel 7:29</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as He was with Moses</b><p>- God&#8217;s faithfulness is consistent; He does not change from one generation to the next (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p>- The mighty acts done through Moses&#8212;plagues, Red Sea, manna&#8212;are the yardstick for what they now expect under Joshua (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10-12</a>; <a href="/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>).<p>- This comparison reassures the people and Joshua alike: the same covenant-keeping God will act with equal power, providing continuity and confidence (<a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1-2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/1-17.htm">Joshua 1:17</a> records a unified commitment from Israel&#8217;s leaders: they promise Joshua the same thorough obedience they previously gave Moses and pray that the LORD&#8217;s manifest presence will rest on him just as it did on Moses.

It certainly appears as though for the last two years of the wandering in the wilderness there was far less rebellion against Moses than before; and after the solemn repetition of the precepts of the law to the new generation which had arisen, given in the Book of Deuteronomy, there seems to have been no rebellion at all (see <a href="/numbers/26-63.htm">Numbers 26:63</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/1-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Just as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we obeyed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#353;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in all things,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1444;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
