The Ark contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, representing God's covenant, authority, and provision. The priests' role highlights the importance of spiritual leadership and obedience in fulfilling God's promises. This act of carrying the Ark signifies the need for divine guidance and intervention in crossing the Jordan, a formidable barrier to entering the Promised Land.<p><b>&#8212;the Lord of all the earth&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and authority over all creation. It serves as a reminder that the God of Israel is not a local deity but the supreme ruler of the entire earth. This declaration of God's dominion reassures the Israelites of His power to control natural elements, such as the waters of the Jordan, and to fulfill His promises. It also foreshadows the universal scope of God's plan, which extends beyond Israel to all nations.<p><b>touch down in the waters of the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River represents a significant geographical and spiritual boundary. Geographically, it separates the wilderness from the Promised Land. Spiritually, it symbolizes a transition from the old life of wandering to a new life of promise and fulfillment. The act of the priests stepping into the river demonstrates faith and obedience, as the waters were at flood stage, making the crossing humanly impossible without divine intervention.<p><b>its flowing waters will be cut off</b><br>This miraculous event parallels the parting of the Red Sea, reinforcing God's power to deliver His people. The cutting off of the waters signifies God's ability to remove obstacles and provide a way where there seems to be none. It serves as a testament to His faithfulness and might, encouraging the Israelites to trust in His provision and protection as they enter the land He promised to their ancestors.<p><b>and will stand up in a heap.</b><br>The waters standing in a heap is a supernatural occurrence, demonstrating God's control over nature. This imagery recalls the creation narrative, where God separates waters to create dry land, highlighting His creative power. It also prefigures the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan, where the heavens open, signifying a new beginning. The standing waters symbolize the halting of chaos and the establishment of order, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground, just as they did at the Red Sea.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The Levitical priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Law, symbolizing God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jordan_river.htm">Jordan River</a></b><br>The river that the Israelites needed to cross to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>Referred to as "the Lord of all the earth," emphasizing His sovereignty and power over creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The title "the Lord of all the earth" reminds us of God's ultimate authority over creation.
