The concept of "rest" is deeply rooted in the biblical narrative, symbolizing not only physical safety but also spiritual peace and fulfillment. This rest is a foretaste of the ultimate rest promised in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers are invited to enter God's eternal rest through faith in Christ. The geographical context of Canaan, surrounded by hostile nations, underscores the miraculous nature of this peace, as it was not achieved by human effort but by divine intervention.<p><b>just as He had sworn to their fathers</b><br>This refers to the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:3, 28:13). God's faithfulness to His promises is a central theme throughout Scripture, demonstrating His unchanging nature and reliability. This fulfillment also serves as a reminder of the importance of faith and obedience, as the Israelites' journey to this point was marked by both faithfulness and rebellion.<p><b>None of their enemies could stand against them</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine protection and victory granted to Israel. The historical context reveals that the Canaanite nations were formidable adversaries, yet they were unable to withstand the Israelites because of God's intervention. This mirrors the New Testament assurance found in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, "If God is for us, who can be against us?" It emphasizes the theme of God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will.<p><b>for the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand</b><br>The deliverance of enemies into Israel's hand is a testament to God's power and His role as a divine warrior on behalf of His people. This echoes the earlier victories in the Exodus narrative, where God fought for Israel against Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate victory over sin and death achieved through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from spiritual enemies (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>). The phrase underscores the idea that true victory comes from reliance on God rather than human strength or strategy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel who fulfills His promises and grants rest and victory to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are the recipients of God's promises and the ones experiencing rest and victory in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the patriarchs, where the Israelites are now settled and experiencing peace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_israel.htm">Enemies of Israel</a></b><br>The various nations and peoples who opposed Israel's settlement in Canaan but were defeated by God's intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_patriarchs.htm">The Patriarchs (Fathers)</a></b><br>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom God originally made the promise of land and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, as seen in the fulfillment of His word to the patriarchs.

Earlier promises anticipated exactly this (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>: &#8220;He gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in security.&#8221;). The phrase paints a 360-degree picture:<p>&#8226; No hostile borders to guard night and day.<p>&#8226; No pockets of resistance festering within Canaan.<p>&#8226; Freedom for families to plant vineyards, raise livestock, and celebrate the feasts without looking over their shoulders.<p>Total coverage displays God&#8217;s thoroughness&#8212;He leaves no loose ends.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as He had sworn to their fathers</b><p>The peace Israel enjoyed traced back centuries to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; 26:3).

It echoes the pledge in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a> and <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>. Notice the verb &#8220;stand&#8221; highlights inability even to begin effective resistance.<p>Practical implications:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people weren&#8217;t merely delivered from attack; potential attackers lost capacity.<p>&#8226; Fear shifted: instead of Israel trembling, adversaries did (<a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Security bred gratitude, not complacency&#8212;Joshua later exhorts the people to cling to the LORD who fought for them (<a href="/joshua/23-8.htm">Joshua 23:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand</b><p>Here&#8217;s the positive angle: God personally placed every foe under Israel&#8217;s control (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>). The sequence matters:<p>1. God acts.<p>2. Enemies fall.<p>3. Israel receives.<p>This prevents boasting and cultivates dependence. Whenever Israel forgot this pattern, losses followed (<a href="/bsb/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>). Victory is therefore both a gift and a stewardship&#8212;meant to be guarded by continued faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a> testifies that God finished exactly what He promised: complete rest, comprehensive peace, and undeniable victory. The verse showcases His faithfulness, His power to disarm every threat, and His gracious invitation to live in the safety He provides. It encourages believers today to trust the same unchanging God who delivers, protects, and keeps every word He has spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord gave them rest.</span> LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The student of Scripture will not fail to recall the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/joshua/4-8.htm">Joshua 4:8</a>) in which reference is made to this passage, and especially to the LXX. version of it. The word signifies rather rest from wandering than rest from toil, though in some passages (e.g. <a href="/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>) it has the latter signification (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Round about.</span> Or, <span class="accented">from</span> round about, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the assaults of the surrounding nations. <span class="cmt_word">According to all that he sware</span> (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There stood not a man of all their enemies before them</span>. This was true, as far as the present history is concerned. We read that the Ephraimites did not, or "could not," drive out their enemies, and that the other tribes also failed to obtain complete possession of the land. But <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we are not told that this was in the time of Joshua, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is intimated that this was their own fault. <p>How could it be otherwise? Had the same faith been theirs which caused the Jordan to dry up, and the towers of Jericho to fall down at their march, which discomfited one vast confederacy at Beth-horon, and annihilated another vast confederacy, even better supplied with munitions of war at Lake Merom, they could not have failed to root out the scanty remnant of their humiliated and disheartened foes. As has already been remarked (see <a href="/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>, note), it was from no neglect on Joshua's part that this was not done at once, for it had been God's own command that it should not be done, lest the country should become a desert (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>). Calvin concludes a similar argument with the words, "nothing but their own cowardice prevented them from enjoying the blessings of God in all their fulness." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/21-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gave them rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;na&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
