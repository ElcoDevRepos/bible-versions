This reflects the importance of keeping one's word, a principle deeply rooted in the biblical narrative (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). Joshua's leadership is characterized by adherence to oaths, even when made under false pretenses, highlighting the value of integrity and the fear of God over human judgment.<p><b>and delivered them from the hands of the Israelites</b><br>The Israelites were initially inclined to destroy the Gibeonites due to their deceit (<a href="/joshua/9-18.htm">Joshua 9:18-19</a>). However, Joshua's intervention underscores the sanctity of covenants. This act of deliverance can be seen as a type of Christ, who delivers humanity from the consequences of sin. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of mercy triumphing over judgment (<a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>).<p><b>and they did not kill the Gibeonites</b><br>The sparing of the Gibeonites, despite their deception, illustrates God's grace and the possibility of redemption for those outside the covenant community. This event foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into God's plan of salvation, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>). The Gibeonites' survival also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the unexpected ways He fulfills His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.

This resolves a tension: <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a> commanded Israel to destroy the Canaanite peoples, yet <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> insists that an oath made before the LORD must be kept.

Compare Moses interceding for Israel in <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9-14</a>; a single leader&#8217;s obedience can spare many lives. Joshua&#8217;s act also anticipates <a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-2</a>, where Saul&#8217;s later violation of this covenant brings famine on Israel&#8212;showing God still took the promise seriously centuries later.<p>Leadership lessons:<p>&#8226; Spiritual authority includes the courage to restrain wrongful zeal (<a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Covenant faithfulness safeguards the nation from future judgment (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they did not kill the Gibeonites</b><p>The outcome is crystal clear: life preserved.

Later, the spared Gibeonites become wood-cutters and water-carriers &#8220;for the altar of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>), placing them in continual proximity to worship. In <a href="/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6-10</a>, Israel even goes to battle to defend Gibeon, turning former enemies into allies. Centuries afterward, descendants of Gibeon appear among temple servants returning from exile (<a href="/nehemiah/7-25.htm">Nehemiah 7:25</a>), suggesting lasting inclusion.<p>Gospel echoes:<p>&#8226; Foreigners brought near by covenant foreshadow Gentile inclusion in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Mercy triumphs over judgment when God&#8217;s people honor His ways (<a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-26.htm">Joshua 9:26</a> reveals the power of covenant faithfulness.
