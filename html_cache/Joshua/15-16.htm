The challenge to capture it indicates its strategic importance and the resistance faced by the Israelites. This reflects the ongoing struggle to fully possess the Promised Land, as God had commanded. The act of striking down and capturing the city signifies a complete victory over the Canaanite inhabitants, aligning with the divine mandate to drive out the nations from the land.<p><b>I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.&#8221;</b><br>Offering a daughter in marriage as a reward was a common practice in ancient times, often used to forge alliances and reward bravery. Acsah's marriage would not only be a personal union but also a means to strengthen familial and tribal bonds. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where marriages were often arranged and served broader social and political purposes. The mention of Acsah also highlights the role of women in biblical narratives, where they often play significant roles in the unfolding of God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/caleb.htm">Caleb</a></b><br>A leader from the tribe of Judah, known for his faithfulness and courage.
