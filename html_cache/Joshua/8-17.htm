Ai was a smaller city near Bethel, and both were located in the central hill country of Canaan. The strategic alliance between these cities indicates the threat Israel posed to the region. Historically, Bethel was a significant city, often associated with worship and later idolatry. The absence of men suggests a total commitment to the battle, leaving their cities vulnerable. This reflects the desperation and confidence of the Canaanites in their military strategy.<p><b>who did not go out after Israel</b><br>The pursuit of Israel by the men of Ai and Bethel demonstrates their belief in a potential victory, likely due to the previous defeat of Israel at Ai (Joshua 7). This overconfidence was part of Joshua's strategy, as he used a feigned retreat to draw them out. The tactic of luring the enemy away from their stronghold is a classic military maneuver, showing Joshua's wisdom and God's guidance in battle. This also serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience to God, contrasting the earlier failure due to Achan's sin.<p><b>leaving the city wide open</b><br>The phrase indicates the vulnerability of Ai and Bethel, as their defenses were abandoned. This was a critical error, as it allowed the Israelites to execute their ambush successfully. The open city symbolizes the exposure of the Canaanite's false security and the impending judgment upon them. In a broader biblical context, it reflects the theme of divine justice and the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel regarding the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>while they pursued Israel</b><br>The pursuit signifies the Canaanites' aggressive stance, driven by their desire to defeat Israel decisively. This action, however, plays into the hands of Joshua's strategy, orchestrated by divine instruction. The pursuit is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where the enemies of God's people are lured into traps, such as the Egyptians at the Red Sea (Exodus 14). It underscores the theme of God using the plans of the wicked to bring about their downfall, ultimately pointing to the sovereignty of God in the affairs of nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ai.htm">Ai</a></b><br>A Canaanite city that Israel initially failed to conquer due to Achan's sin but later defeated under God's guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A nearby city to Ai, whose men joined the pursuit against Israel, leaving both cities vulnerable.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, led by Joshua, executing a strategic military plan to conquer Ai.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, who followed God's instructions to orchestrate a successful ambush against Ai.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ambush.htm">The Ambush</a></b><br>A strategic military tactic commanded by God, where part of the Israelite army lured the men of Ai and Bethel away from their cities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_strategy.htm">Obedience to God's Strategy</a></b><br>Joshua's success at Ai underscores the importance of following God's specific instructions.

The verse illustrates God-given strategy overcoming superior numbers, warns against misplaced confidence, and affirms that victory belongs to those who trust and obey the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">There was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el.</span>--Another singular justification of the peculiar strategy of Joshua. The road past Beth-el to Ai had been left open. It passes the north end of the two ravines in which Joshua's ambush was posted. At the same time, it would have been easy to conceal a chain of sentinels that could observe it and tell the 35,000 men in ambush what was going on, so that if any attempt had been made by the men of Beth-el to protect Ai, it could easily have been frustrated. But no one suspected any danger, and therefore no such attempt was made. The men of Beth-el and Ai took the road that was left open to them and pursued the Israelites, probably down the ancient way past Michmash towards the Shebarim, leaving Beth-el and Ai both unprotected. After they had gone some distance, about a mile or a mile and a half from Ai, this road would bring them past the lower end of the ravine in which the ambush was posted. A second chain of outposts would easily take the signal from Joshua when this point had been passed, and then all was over with the town of Ai.<p>It is curious that we do not hear of the capture of Beth-el at this time, though it would have been perfectly easy to take it. The king of Beth-el is named in the list of those whom Joshua smote (<a href="/joshua/12-16.htm" title="The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;">Joshua 12:16</a>). We read of its capture in <a href="/judges/1-22.htm" title="And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.">Judges 1:22</a>, and of the "entrance into the city" being sought for and betrayed. But that can hardly have been the <span class= "ital">first </span>capture of the town.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or Bethel.</span> These words are not in the LXX., and they may possibly have been a marginal gloss, for the intervention of the people of Bethel in this battle is very unintelligible. See note on Joshua 7:2. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the difficulty involved in their retention may have caused their omission from the LXX., and it may perhaps be thought possible that, on the capture of Ai, the Bethelites returned with all speed to their city, and that Joshua postponed its capture in consequence of the formidable confederacy (<a href="/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1, 2</a>), which his success had called into existence, or, perhaps, by a desire to signalise at once the victory at Ai by the ceremony (vers. 30-35) at Gerizim. We read in <a href="/joshua/12-16.htm">Joshua 12:16</a> that Bethel was taken.
