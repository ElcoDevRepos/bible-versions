The allotment for Benjamin begins with its northern border, reminding us that God assigns every tribe a specific place (cf. <a href="/numbers/34-1.htm">Numbers 34:1&#8211;12</a>). The phrase underscores divine order&#8212;no boundary is random; the same God who &#8220;formed the mountains&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>) also draws tribal lines so families can flourish in safety (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their border began at the Jordan</b><p>The Jordan River, a natural eastern marker for Israel (<a href="/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-6.htm">2 Kings 2:6&#8211;8</a>), here defines Benjamin&#8217;s northeastern corner. God previously stopped these very waters for Israel to cross (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13&#8211;17</a>), showing His power over obstacles and His faithfulness in providing territory. For Benjamin, the Jordan offered life-giving water and a clear frontier&#8212;all evidence of God&#8217;s wise provision (<a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went up past the northern slope of Jericho</b><p>Moving south-west, the line &#8220;went up past the northern slope of Jericho.&#8221; Jericho was the first city Israel conquered in Canaan (<a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1&#8211;21</a>), a perpetual reminder that victory comes from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>). Placing the border just north of Jericho kept Benjamin adjacent to that historic site while leaving the city itself in Ephraim&#8217;s allotment (<a href="/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>). Geography thus preserves corporate memory of God&#8217;s power without tribal rivalry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Headed west through the hill country</b><p>The boundary then &#8220;headed west through the hill country,&#8221; a region later known for fortified towns and vineyards (<a href="/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>). Hills mean defense and fertility; both signal divine blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7&#8211;9</a>). Walking westward points toward the Mediterranean trade routes, giving Benjamin potential economic access while keeping its heartland secure among the heights (<a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And came out at the wilderness of Beth-aven</b><p>Finally, the line &#8220;came out at the wilderness of Beth-aven.&#8221; Beth-aven&#8212;a desolate area east of Bethel (<a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>)&#8212;marks the northwest limit. &#8220;Wilderness&#8221; hints at sparsity, yet proximity to Bethel, a place of worship and covenant remembrance (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>; <a href="/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26-27</a>), balances the harsh landscape with spiritual significance. The border closes where worship meets wilderness, illustrating how God frames His people with both challenge and promise (<a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/18-12.htm">Joshua 18:12</a> traces Benjamin&#8217;s northern boundary from the life-giving Jordan, past Jericho&#8217;s testimony of conquest, over protective hills, and out to a wilderness touched by worship. Each landmark showcases God&#8217;s meticulous provision&#8212;defining space, recalling past victories, offering defense and resources, and situating His people between dependence and devotion. The verse assures believers that just as every border was set by God&#8217;s hand, so too are the boundaries of our lives established for our good and His glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/18-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the north</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1464;&#1508;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular &#124;
