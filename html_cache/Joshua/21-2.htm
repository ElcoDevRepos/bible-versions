It was situated in the hill country of Ephraim, centrally located in the land of Canaan, which was the Promised Land given to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Shiloh's role as a spiritual hub underscores its importance in Israel's early history, serving as a place of worship and decision-making. The choice of Shiloh reflects God's presence and guidance among His people during this period.<p><b>and said to them,</b><br>This phrase indicates a formal communication or request, likely involving the leaders of the tribes of Israel. The context suggests a gathering of the Israelites, possibly the elders or representatives, to address a matter of communal importance. The act of speaking to the leaders at Shiloh emphasizes the organized structure of Israelite society and the importance of following divine instructions.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD commanded through Moses</b><br>This reference to a command from the LORD through Moses highlights the continuity of God's covenant and instructions from the time of the Exodus to the settlement in Canaan. It underscores the authority of Moses as God's chosen leader and prophet, whose words and actions were directed by divine mandate. This continuity is crucial for maintaining the unity and identity of the Israelite community as they settle in the Promised Land.<p><b>that we be given cities in which to live,</b><br>The request for cities reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to provide for the Levites, who were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, they were to be given specific cities within the territories of the other tribes. This arrangement ensured that the Levites could perform their priestly functions throughout Israel, maintaining the spiritual health of the nation.<p><b>together with pasturelands for our livestock.&#8221;</b><br>The inclusion of pasturelands was necessary for the Levites' sustenance, as they relied on livestock for food and economic stability. This provision reflects God's care for the practical needs of those dedicated to His service. The allocation of pasturelands also ensured that the Levites could remain focused on their religious duties without the distraction of seeking additional means of support. This arrangement highlights the integration of spiritual and practical aspects of life in Israel, ensuring that the Levites could fulfill their roles effectively.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>A significant city in the land of Canaan where the Israelites set up the Tabernacle after entering the Promised Land.
