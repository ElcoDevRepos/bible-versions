This moment occurs after the miraculous crossing of the Jordan River, where God stopped the waters to allow the Israelites to pass on dry ground. Joshua's leadership is crucial as he guides the people into the Promised Land, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham. This phrase highlights Joshua's role as a mediator between God and the Israelites, similar to Moses, and foreshadows Christ as the ultimate mediator.<p><b>In the future</b><br>This phrase indicates a forward-looking perspective, emphasizing the importance of remembering God's acts for future generations. It reflects the biblical theme of remembrance and the transmission of faith, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children. It underscores the continuity of God's covenant and the importance of historical memory in maintaining faith.<p><b>when your children ask their fathers</b><br>The phrase anticipates a time when children, curious about their heritage and faith, will seek understanding from their parents. This reflects the cultural and familial structure of ancient Israel, where oral tradition and storytelling were vital for passing down history and religious beliefs. It also highlights the responsibility of parents to educate their children in the ways of the Lord, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>.<p><b>&#8216;What is the meaning of these stones?&#8217;</b><br>The stones refer to the twelve stones taken from the Jordan River and set up at Gilgal as a memorial. This act of setting up stones as a memorial is a common practice in the Old Testament, serving as a tangible reminder of God's faithfulness and mighty acts. The stones symbolize the twelve tribes of Israel and God's deliverance, similar to the Passover as a memorial of the Exodus. This practice of creating physical reminders points to the sacraments in Christianity, such as baptism and communion, which serve as reminders of Christ's work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, who guided them into the Promised Land.
