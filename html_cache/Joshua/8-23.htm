The capture of the king alive also fulfilled God's command to Joshua to conquer the land and its inhabitants (<a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2-6</a>). This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where He takes captive the powers of darkness (<a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>).<p><b>and brought him to Joshua</b><br>Joshua, as the leader of Israel, was responsible for executing God's judgment on the Canaanite cities. Bringing the king to Joshua signifies the submission of Ai to Israel's authority and, by extension, to God's will. This act of bringing the king to Joshua can be compared to the submission of all nations to Christ, the greater Joshua, in the eschatological fulfillment of God's kingdom (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).
