It was a significant city during the time of the Judges and the early monarchy of Israel. The mention of Ekron here indicates the northern boundary of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah. Ekron's association with the Philistines highlights the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, particularly in the books of Judges and Samuel.<p><b>Curved toward Shikkeron</b><br>Shikkeron is not widely mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and its exact location is uncertain. However, its inclusion in the boundary description suggests it was a known landmark at the time. The term "curved" indicates a change in direction, which is typical in boundary descriptions, emphasizing the precision with which the land was divided among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>Proceeded to Mount Baalah</b><br>Mount Baalah is likely another name for Mount Jearim, which is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>. This mountain is part of the Judean hill country, and its mention here helps to define the western boundary of Judah's territory. The name "Baalah" may indicate a place where the Canaanite god Baal was worshiped, reflecting the syncretistic religious practices that Israel was warned against.<p><b>Went on to Jabneel</b><br>Jabneel, also known as Jabneh, was a city on the border of Judah and Dan. It later became an important Jewish center after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. The city's strategic location near the coast made it significant in both trade and military defense. Its mention here marks the continuation of the boundary line toward the Mediterranean Sea.<p><b>And ended at the Sea</b><br>The "Sea" refers to the Mediterranean Sea, which formed the western boundary of the land allotted to the tribe of Judah. This boundary description underscores the extent of the Promised Land as given to the Israelites. The sea also symbolizes the vastness and the promise of God's provision, as the land stretched from the desert to the sea, fulfilling the promise made to Abraham about the land his descendants would inherit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ekron.htm">Ekron</a></b><br>One of the five major Philistine cities, located in the northern part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah.
