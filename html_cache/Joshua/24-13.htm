It underscores God's sovereignty and grace, as the land was given not by their own efforts but by God's promise to their ancestors (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This reflects the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, emphasizing that the land was a divine inheritance rather than a human achievement.<p><b>and cities that you did not build</b><br>The Israelites inherited cities that were already established, which signifies God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises. This can be seen as a parallel to the spiritual inheritance believers receive in Christ, where salvation and the Kingdom of God are gifts not earned by human effort (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The cities represent stability and civilization, which were crucial for the establishment of Israel as a nation.<p><b>and now you live in them</b><br>This phrase indicates the present reality of God's promise being fulfilled. The Israelites' occupation of the land is a testament to God's faithfulness. It also serves as a reminder of the rest and security found in God's provision, akin to the spiritual rest promised to believers in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>.<p><b>and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.</b><br>Vineyards and olive groves symbolize abundance and prosperity. In ancient Israel, these were signs of wealth and blessing, as they provided essential food and resources. This abundance is a direct result of God's blessing and serves as a reminder of His provision. The imagery of vineyards is also used in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to Himself as the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>), symbolizing spiritual nourishment and life in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who is delivering his farewell address to the Israelites in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have been led into the Promised Land, receiving blessings they did not earn.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants, now inhabited by the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyards_and_olive_groves.htm">Vineyards and Olive Groves</a></b><br>Symbols of prosperity and blessing, representing the abundance provided by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_renewal_at_shechem.htm">Covenant Renewal at Shechem</a></b><br>The event where Joshua calls the Israelites to renew their covenant with God, reminding them of His faithfulness and their responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>Recognize that all blessings come from God, not from our own efforts.
