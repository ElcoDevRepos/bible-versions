Joshua, as the appointed leader after Moses, is a type of Christ, leading his people into the Promised Land. The phrase "all Israel with him" signifies the entire community's involvement, reflecting the importance of unity in achieving God's purposes. This unity is reminiscent of the church's call to be one body in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>went up from Eglon to Hebron</b><br>The journey from Eglon to Hebron involves a significant geographical ascent, as Hebron is located in the hill country of Judah. Hebron is historically significant as it was previously associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were buried in the Cave of Machpelah there (<a href="/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19, 25</a>:9, 49:29-32). This connection underscores the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs regarding the land. Hebron later becomes a city of refuge and a Levitical city, highlighting its continued importance in Israel's history.<p><b>and fought against it</b><br>The act of fighting against Hebron is part of the broader campaign to conquer the land of Canaan, as commanded by God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This military action is not merely a territorial conquest but a divine mandate to establish a holy nation set apart for God's purposes. The battles in Joshua can be seen as a foreshadowing of the spiritual battles Christians face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are called to put on the full armor of God. The conquest of Hebron also signifies the removal of idolatry and the establishment of God's rule, paralleling the spiritual cleansing and dedication required in the believer's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.

Joshua "passes" from one city to another in the plain. He "goes up" to Hebron, which is situated among the hills. See note on ver. 3; cf. also <a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Hebron</span>. Commentators of the school of Maurer and De Wette regard the taking of Hebron and Debir as irreconcilable with <a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-17</a>. But this is by no means certain. The operations of Joshua were sudden, and, so far as they went, decisive, But it is never pretended that his conquest of southern Palestine was complete. It is impossible to assert this in the face of such passages as <a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>, 17:12, 13, and especially in the face of such a fact as the continued existence of the Philistine power. Joshua extirpated the inhabitants of the cities he took, but there were many others - some of at least equal importance - which he did not take. We may instance Gaza, Garb, and Ashdod. See <a href="/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a>. Their inhabitants came and occupied again the cities which Joshua had destroyed, first when he was engaged in operations in the north and west, and again when the Israelites had begun to repose upon their laurels, and to neglect the task God had set them, namely, the complete extermination of the Canaanite race from Palestine. Thus Joshua returned from the north and found a large part of the country he had subdued reoccupied by the giant tribes of the south. He "cut them off from Hebron and Debir," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he compelled them to evacuate those cities, but there was no necessity for a second of either. Yet at a later period they still lurked in the neighborhood (<a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>), perhaps in the mountain fastnessess (a very common thing in the history of nations, as the history of our own country, of the Basques in the Pyrenees, and of Swiss freedom shows), and were strong enough to regain Debir (<a href="/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>). Jerusalem itself (see note on ver. 1) had a similar fate. After the capture of Jerusalem the Israelites were unable to hold it permanently (<a href="/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>; cf. <a href="/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8, 21</a>). And such expressions as "all the cities thereof" show that the south of Palestine was thickly populated. Each city was, like Gibeon, the head of a small confederacy. And as the chief cities smitten by Joshua would have been but a tithe of the confederations existing in the south, the task of reoccupying must have been an easy one. It seems to be implied in <a href="/judges/1.htm">Judges 1</a>. that Caleb took Hebron and Debir after Joshua's death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1440;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
