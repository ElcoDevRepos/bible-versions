This act raised concerns among the other Israelite tribes, as it seemed to suggest a division in worship practices. In ancient Israel, the construction of altars was significant, as altars were central to worship and sacrifice. The Israelites were commanded to worship at the tabernacle, and later the temple, as the central place of worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>). Building a separate altar could imply a break from the unified worship of Yahweh.<p><b>to turn away from Him</b><br>Turning away from God in the Old Testament often refers to idolatry or apostasy. The Israelites were repeatedly warned against turning to other gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The concern here is that the altar might symbolize a departure from the covenant relationship with Yahweh, which was central to Israel's identity and survival as a nation. This phrase underscores the seriousness of maintaining fidelity to God.<p><b>and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it</b><br>Burnt offerings and grain offerings were integral parts of the sacrificial system established in Leviticus. Burnt offerings symbolized atonement and dedication to God (Leviticus 1), while grain offerings represented thanksgiving and devotion (Leviticus 2). Offering these sacrifices on an unauthorized altar would contravene the law and suggest a rival worship system, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8-9</a>).<p><b>or to sacrifice peace offerings on it</b><br>Peace offerings, described in <a href="/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>, were meant to symbolize fellowship and reconciliation with God. They were communal meals shared between the offerer, the priests, and God. Offering peace offerings on a separate altar could imply a breach in the communal worship and unity of Israel, which was meant to be centered around the tabernacle.<p><b>may the LORD Himself hold us accountable</b><br>This phrase reflects the seriousness with which the tribes viewed their covenant with God. They invoke God's judgment upon themselves if they have acted in rebellion. This reflects a deep understanding of God's sovereignty and justice, as well as a commitment to accountability before Him. It echoes the covenant curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience would lead to divine retribution. This accountability is a theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing that God is the ultimate judge of human actions (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eastern_tribes.htm">The Eastern Tribes (Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh)</a></b><br>These tribes settled on the east side of the Jordan River and built an altar, which led to a misunderstanding with the other Israelite tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_witness.htm">The Altar of Witness</a></b><br>A large altar built by the Eastern tribes near the Jordan River, intended as a witness between them and the other tribes of Israel that they all serve the same God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas,_son_of_eleazar_the_priest.htm">Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest</a></b><br>Sent by the Israelites to confront the Eastern tribes about the altar, fearing it was a sign of rebellion against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The geographical boundary that separated the Eastern tribes from the rest of Israel, symbolizing potential division.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_of_israel.htm">The Assembly of Israel</a></b><br>The collective body of the remaining tribes who were concerned about the potential idolatry or rebellion represented by the altar.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_worship.htm">Unity in Worship</a></b><br>The altar was a potential source of division, but it was intended as a symbol of unity.

This teaches us the importance of clear communication and understanding others' intentions before jumping to conclusions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_to_god.htm">Accountability to God</a></b><br>The tribes were willing to be held accountable by God if their actions were wrong. We should also live with a mindset of accountability to God for our actions and decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_assumptions.htm">Avoiding Assumptions</a></b><br>The initial reaction of the Israelites was based on assumptions. We should be cautious about making assumptions about others' actions without seeking clarification.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolic_reminders.htm">Symbolic Reminders</a></b><br>The altar served as a reminder of their shared faith.
