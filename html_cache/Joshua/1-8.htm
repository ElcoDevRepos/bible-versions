This phrase emphasizes the importance of constant verbal engagement with Scripture, suggesting that it should be a regular part of conversation and teaching. In ancient Israel, oral tradition was a primary means of preserving and transmitting knowledge. The command to keep the Law on one's lips underscores the necessity of internalizing God's Word, ensuring it influences every aspect of life. This practice is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to talk about the commandments at all times.<p><b>meditate on it day and night,</b><br>Meditation in this context involves deep, continuous reflection and contemplation of God's Word. Unlike Eastern meditation, which often seeks to empty the mind, biblical meditation focuses on filling the mind with Scripture. The call to meditate "day and night" implies a lifestyle of constant engagement with God's Word, allowing it to shape thoughts, attitudes, and actions. <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2-3</a> similarly describes the blessed man who delights in the law of the Lord and meditates on it continually, likening him to a tree planted by streams of water, yielding fruit in season.<p><b>so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.</b><br>The purpose of meditation is obedience. Knowledge of the Law is not an end in itself but a means to live according to God's will. The phrase "be careful to do" indicates a deliberate and intentional effort to align one's life with God's commands. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to the Law was a condition for receiving God's blessings. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a> reinforces this idea, urging believers to be doers of the Word, not merely hearers.<p><b>For then you will prosper and succeed in all you do.</b><br>Prosperity and success, in this context, are contingent upon adherence to God's Law. This promise is not merely material but encompasses spiritual and communal well-being. The Hebrew understanding of prosperity includes peace, fulfillment, and harmony with God and others. The conditional nature of this promise highlights the covenantal framework of Israel's relationship with God, where blessings are tied to obedience. This principle is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience are outlined. The ultimate fulfillment of prosperity and success is found in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Law and offers believers abundant life (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_the_law.htm">The Book of the Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain God's commandments and instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/meditation.htm">Meditation</a></b><br>The act of deeply contemplating or reflecting on God's Word, as instructed to Joshua.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prosperity_and_success.htm">Prosperity and Success</a></b><br>The promised outcome of obedience and meditation on God's Word.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_god's_word.htm">The Centrality of God's Word</a></b><br>God's Word should be at the center of our lives, guiding our thoughts, words, and actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_practice_of_meditation.htm">The Practice of Meditation</a></b><br>Regular meditation on Scripture is crucial for spiritual growth and understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_leads_to_success.htm">Obedience Leads to Success</a></b><br>True success and prosperity come from living in obedience to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_devotion.htm">Consistency in Devotion</a></b><br>Consistent engagement with Scripture, both day and night, is essential for a strong faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_spoken_word.htm">The Power of the Spoken Word</a></b><br>Speaking God's Word reinforces its truths in our hearts and minds.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_1_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 1:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Practical_ways_to_meditate_on_God_s_Word.htm">How can we meditate on God's Word "day and night" practically today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_do_not_let_this_Book_depart.htm">What does "do not let this Book of the Law depart" mean?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Joshua_1_8_Psalm_1_2_on_the_law.htm">How does Joshua 1:8 connect with Psalm 1:2 about delighting in the law?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_ensure_we_follow_it_fully.htm">In what ways can we "be careful to do everything written in it"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Scripture_meditation_path_to_success.htm">How does meditating on Scripture lead to "prosperity and success" in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_1_8_Daily_meditation_on_God_s_Word.htm">How does Joshua 1:8 emphasize the importance of meditating on God's Word daily?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_obedience_lead_to_success_in_Joshua_1_8.htm">What role does obedience play in the success promised in Joshua 1:8?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_1_8_and_biblical_prosperity.htm">How does Joshua 1:8 relate to the concept of prosperity in a biblical context?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_lectio_divina.htm">What is Lectio Divina?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_meditating_on_god's_word.htm">What does meditating on God's Word mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_transcendental_meditation.htm">What defines Transcendental Meditation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_did_joshua_lead_the_israelites.htm">How did Joshua lead the Israelites into the Promised Land?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Joshua 1:8 Mean</div><b>This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s charge is continual conversation with His Word.

Thus the true significance of Joshua's position appears, and also the difference between Moses and all who followed him. Moses was the prophet <span class= "ital">"</span>whom the Lord knew face to face." Joshua and <span class= "ital">all </span>his successors, from the least to the greatest, find their blessing and their portion in the careful study and fulfilment of the written word of God. It is also worthy of notice that God's Word, from its very first appearance as a collective book (viz., the law), occupies the same position. It is supreme. It is set above Joshua. It is never superseded. And its authority is independent of its quantity. "The law of Moses," "Moses and the prophets," "The law, the prophets, and the Psalms," are descriptions of the Bible differing in the quantity of the matter, but not differing in the authority they exercise or in their relation to the living church. "Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy of this book, and keep those things that are written therein," are words that apply to Holy Scripture equally, in every stage, from the completion of the law of Moses to the completion of the entire book.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This book of the law.</span> The law was, therefore, embodied in a written document when the Book of Joshua was written; and as the antiquity of this Book may be regarded as proved, we may quote thus an early authority for the genuineness of at least some portions of the Pentateuch. There was a "book of the law" in Joshua's time, according to this early testimony, and we may conclude from vers. 3-7 that Deuteronomy formed a part of it (see also <a href="/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19</a> for a similar precept. And for the fact see <a href="/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Meditate therein</span> (cf. <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, 63:7, 143:5, in the original. Also <a href="/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Observe to do.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">keep to do</span>, thus impressing on us the care necessary in deciding on our actions. <span class="cmt_word">All that is written therein</span> (cf. for the expression <a href="/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58, 61</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-19.htm">Deuteronomy 29:19, 20, 26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-10.htm">Deuteronomy 30:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall have good success.</span> The word is the same as is translated "prosper" above, and <span class="accented">not</span> the same as that rendered "prosperous" in this verse. "Men," says Calvin, "never act skilfully, except in so far as they allow themselves to be ruled by the Word of God." <span class="cmt_word">Have I not commanded thee?</span> "An emphatic inquiry is a stronger form of affirmation, and is generally employed by those who wish to infuse into another courage and alacrity" (Michaelis). Moreover <span class="accented">repetition</span> is a remarkable feature of Hebrew composition, as we may observe from the second chapter of Genesis onward, and is designed to give emphasis to what is commanded or related. Calvin would lay stress on <span class="accented">I:</span> "Have not <span class="accented">I</span> commanded thee?" But this is not borne out by the Hebrew. <p> CHAPTER 1:10-15.
