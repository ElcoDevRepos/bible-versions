This age signifies readiness and capability for the task he was given. In biblical terms, forty often represents a period of testing or preparation, as seen in the forty years of Israel's wandering in the wilderness.<p><b>when Moses the servant of the LORD</b><br>Moses is referred to as the servant of the LORD, highlighting his role as a faithful leader chosen by God to guide the Israelites. This title underscores Moses' humility and dedication to God's commands, setting a standard for leadership in Israel. It also connects to other biblical figures who are called servants of the LORD, such as David and the prophets.<p><b>sent me from Kadesh-barnea</b><br>Kadesh-barnea was a significant location in the wilderness journey of the Israelites. It served as a base for the exploration of Canaan and was a place of decision and rebellion, as seen in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>. The geographical location is in the Negev desert, near the border of the Promised Land, symbolizing a threshold between the wilderness and the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>to spy out the land</b><br>The mission to spy out the land was a strategic move to assess the land of Canaan, which God had promised to the descendants of Abraham. This task required courage and faith, as the spies were to evaluate the land's inhabitants, cities, and resources. The act of spying out the land is a precursor to the eventual conquest and settlement of Canaan.<p><b>and I brought back to him an honest report</b><br>Caleb's report was characterized by honesty and faithfulness. Unlike the majority of the spies, Caleb and Joshua brought back a report that was aligned with God's promises, emphasizing the land's potential and the Israelites' ability to conquer it with God's help. This honesty reflects Caleb's trust in God's word and contrasts with the fear and doubt expressed by the other spies. Caleb's faithfulness is later rewarded, as seen in his inheritance of Hebron.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/caleb.htm">Caleb</a></b><br>One of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore the Promised Land.

The spies were sent from Kadesh-barnea in the second year of the Exodus, about 38&#171; years before the passage of Jordan (see <a href="/deuteronomy/2-14.htm" title="And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.">Deuteronomy 2:14</a>). Thus Caleb would be 40+38=78 years old when they crossed the Jordan. He was 85 when they began to divide the country. Therefore the conquest itself must have extended over a period of seven years. It is manifest that the record of the capture of Jericho and Ai, with the two campaigns of Joshua against the southern and northern confederacies, does not give <span class= "ital">all </span>the details of the war.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forty years old.</span> The Hebrew expression is "the son of forty years."
