The number three may symbolize completeness and thoroughness, ensuring a balanced representation from each tribe. This method reflects the importance of order and fairness in the distribution of the land, which was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The appointment of representatives from each tribe underscores the communal and participatory nature of this task, emphasizing unity and shared responsibility.<p><b>and I will send them out to survey the land</b><br>The act of surveying the land involves a detailed examination and assessment of the territory. This task required careful observation and recording, which was crucial for an accurate division of the land. The surveyors were to gather firsthand information, which would later be used to allocate the land according to God's instructions. This process highlights the importance of preparation and diligence in fulfilling God's promises. It also reflects the Israelites' transition from a nomadic lifestyle to settling in a land of their own, a significant shift in their history.<p><b>and map it out, according to the inheritance of each</b><br>Mapping the land was an essential step in ensuring that each tribe received its rightful inheritance. This phrase indicates a methodical approach to dividing the land, taking into account the size and needs of each tribe. The concept of inheritance is deeply rooted in the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs, where the land was a tangible sign of God's faithfulness. This allocation was not arbitrary but divinely ordained, reflecting God's sovereignty and justice. The mapping process also foreshadows the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>.<p><b>Then they will return to me</b><br>The return of the surveyors to Joshua signifies accountability and the completion of their mission. It underscores the importance of reporting and verifying the gathered information before making final decisions. This step ensures transparency and trust in the process, as Joshua, the leader appointed by God, would oversee the final distribution. The return also symbolizes the fulfillment of God's promises, as the Israelites were on the brink of fully possessing the land. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ's return, where believers will receive their eternal inheritance, as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land and overseeing its division among the tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_tribes.htm">Israelite Tribes</a></b><br>The twelve tribes of Israel, each of which is to receive a portion of the Promised Land as their inheritance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/surveyors.htm">Surveyors</a></b><br>Three men from each tribe chosen to survey and map the land, ensuring a fair and accurate division according to God's promise.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to be divided among the tribes of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites gathered and where the tabernacle was set up, serving as a central location for the division of the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The Israelites were to follow God's specific instructions for dividing the land, highlighting the importance of obedience in receiving God's promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_cooperation.htm">Unity and Cooperation</a></b><br>The selection of three men from each tribe emphasizes the need for unity and cooperation among the tribes in fulfilling God's plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_provision.htm">Faith in God's Provision</a></b><br>The division of the land according to God's promise serves as a reminder of His faithfulness and provision for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_responsibility.htm">Stewardship and Responsibility</a></b><br>The task of surveying the land required diligence and accuracy, teaching us about the importance of stewardship in our responsibilities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>The process of dividing the land was methodical and required patience, reminding us to trust in God's timing and plan for our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_18_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 18:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_18_4_on_organized_leadership.htm">How does Joshua 18:4 emphasize the importance of organized leadership in God's plan?

This keeps the distribution transparent and communal (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>).<p>- The number three provides credible testimony: &#8220;A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p>- Involving the tribes themselves moves them from passivity to participation; Israel cannot settle the land by spectating (compare <a href="/judges/18-9.htm">Judges 18:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I will send them out</b><p>- Joshua, God-appointed leader (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18&#8211;20</a>), acts with delegated authority: &#8220;Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>).<p>- Being &#8220;sent&#8221; turns ordinary men into servants on mission, echoing later patterns of commissioning (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>; <a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>).<p>- Obedience precedes blessing. Remaining camped at Shiloh without action would delay inheritance (<a href="/joshua/18-3.htm">Joshua 18:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To survey the land</b><p>- Practical wisdom and faith meet: they must see what God has already given (<a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17&#8211;18</a>, but this time without fear).<p>- Thoroughness honors God. &#8220;Prepare your work outside; get everything ready for yourself in the field&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/24-27.htm">Proverbs 24:27</a>).<p>- Accurate knowledge prevents later disputes (<a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And map it out, according to the inheritance of each</b><p>- Mapping ensures equity; every tribe receives land &#8220;by lot according to their families&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>).<p>- Boundaries matter. &#8220;He determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>- The record becomes a covenant document that future generations can consult (<a href="/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they will return to me</b><p>- Accountability: the surveyors must report back so Joshua can cast lots &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>).<p>- Orderly completion reflects God&#8217;s character. Jesus likewise required reports from entrusted servants (<a href="/luke/19-15.htm">Luke 19:15</a>).<p>- Returning to leadership guards against tribal self-interest and keeps unity central (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/18-4.htm">Joshua 18:4</a> shows God guiding His people into promise with order, representation, diligence, fairness, and accountability. By appointing qualified men, sending them on mission, requiring an accurate survey, securing just boundaries, and calling for a faithful report, the verse models how God&#8217;s gifts are received responsibly and in community&#8212;principles that still shape faithful stewardship today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give out from among you.</span> Calvin enlarges much upon the boldness of these twenty-one men in venturing upon the task of the survey, rightly supposing that the difficulty of the task was enhanced by the number who undertook it (see note on Joshua 14:12). And here it is impossible to come to any other conclusion than that the twenty-one commissioners went together, for the object of their selection was to obviate complaints of a kind which, as we have already seen, the Israelites were not slow to make (see <a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14-18</a>). But the Israelites had inspired quite sufficient awe into the inhabitants of the land to make such a general survey by no means a difficult task. Nor is it probable that the commissioners were unprovided with an escort. <span class="cmt_word">Three men for each tribe.</span> Literally, for <span class="accented">the</span> tribe.
