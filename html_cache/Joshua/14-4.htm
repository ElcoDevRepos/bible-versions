Joseph, one of Jacob's twelve sons, received a double portion of inheritance through his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>. This effectively made Joseph's lineage into two separate tribes, fulfilling Jacob's blessing and prophecy over Joseph's sons. This division is significant in the allocation of the Promised Land, as it maintains the number of tribes at twelve, despite the absence of a land inheritance for the Levites. The tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim played crucial roles in Israel's history, with Ephraim often being a leading tribe in the northern kingdom. This division also reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding their descendants.<p><b>And no portion of the land was given to the Levites,</b><br>The Levites, descendants of Levi, were set apart for religious duties and service to the Tabernacle, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>. Their unique role as priests and caretakers of the sanctuary meant they did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, their inheritance was the Lord Himself, and they were supported by the tithes and offerings of the other tribes. This arrangement underscores the Levites' spiritual responsibility and their dependence on God and the community for sustenance, emphasizing the principle of living by faith and service.<p><b>except for cities in which to live,</b><br>The Levites were given specific cities scattered throughout the tribes of Israel, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>. These cities provided them with places to live and serve the people, ensuring that the spiritual and religious needs of the nation were met across the land. The distribution of these cities also facilitated the teaching of the Law and the administration of justice, as the Levites were often involved in these activities. This arrangement highlights the integration of spiritual leadership within the daily life of the Israelites.<p><b>along with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.</b><br>In addition to cities, the Levites were allotted pasturelands surrounding these cities to support their livestock, as described in <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-3</a>. This provision ensured that the Levites could sustain themselves and their families, maintaining their focus on their spiritual duties without the need for extensive agricultural work. The inclusion of pasturelands reflects God's provision for all aspects of the Levites' needs, allowing them to fulfill their role as spiritual leaders and mediators between God and the people. This arrangement also symbolizes the balance between spiritual service and practical living, demonstrating God's care for His servants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_joseph.htm">Sons of Joseph</a></b><br>Refers to the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, who were the sons of Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob (Israel).

Joseph had suffered in Egypt but was exalted; his offspring now enjoyed tangible blessing in Canaan, fulfilling Jacob&#8217;s prophetic words in <a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22-26</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And no portion of the land was given to the Levites, except for cities in which to live, along with pasturelands for their flocks and herds</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; And no portion of the land was given to the Levites, except for cities in which to live, along with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>)<p>&#8226; The Levites&#8217; unique inheritance was the LORD Himself. <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a> records God&#8217;s promise: &#8220;You will have no inheritance in their land&#8230; I am your portion.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Instead of one large territory, they received forty-eight cities scattered among the tribes (<a href="/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1-42</a>). This design kept priests and Levites near every Israelite, enabling worship, teaching, and sacrifice across the nation.<p>&#8226; The pasturelands (<a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-5</a>) supplied daily needs without overshadowing their primary calling to serve at the tabernacle&#8212;and later the temple (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; By withholding a broad tract of land, God protected them from the distractions of agriculture-driven power dynamics that often led other tribes into idolatry (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>). Their dependence on tithes (<a href="/numbers/18-24.htm">Numbers 18:24</a>) kept their focus on Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a> highlights God&#8217;s meticulous ordering of Israel&#8217;s inheritance. Joseph&#8217;s line is honored with two full tribes, confirming the double portion promised to the faithful son, while Levi&#8217;s distinctive priestly role is preserved by granting cities rather than a single territory. Together these details show the LORD distributing blessings precisely, sustaining both civic structure and spiritual life for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the children of Joseph were two tribes</span> (see <a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>): <span class="cmt_word">therefore they gave.</span> There is no "therefore" In the original. The passage is a simple repetition of what we find in <a href="/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14, 33</a>, and is added here to explain how the twelve tribes who actually divided the land were composed. <span class="cmt_word">Suburbs</span>. Rather, "pasture lands;" literally, places where the cattle were <span class="accented">driven out</span> to pasture (cf. <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>, where the Hebrew is "cities of driving out"). We may illustrate this phrase by the similar arrangements made by the Germanic tribes in early times. "The clearing," says Professor Stubbs, in his 'Constitutional History of England,' p. 49, "is surrounded by a thick border of wood or waste .... In the centre of the clearing the village is placed .... The fully qualified freeman has a share in the land of the community. He has a right to the enjoyment of the woods, the pastures, the meadow and the arable land of the mark.... The use of the meadow land is definitely apportioned .... When the grass beans to grow the cattle are driven out, and the meadow is fenced round and divided into as many equal shares as there are mark families in the village. For the arable land similar measures are taken although the task is somewhat more complex" (see note on Joshua 13:23). Some similar arrangement must have taken place in the primitive Jewish settlement of Palestine. For the rude huts of the Teutonic tribes we must substitute the more civilised "cities, walled up to heaven," of the Phoenician races; for the scanty supply of gram and pasture, provided by a northern climate, we must substitute the rich plenty of a land "flowing with milk and honey," and with all the produce of a southern sky. The area of land assigned to each of the Levitical cities was definitely marked out (see <a href="/numbers/35-4.htm">Numbers 35:4, 5</a>), and subdivided, as the hints in the narrative seem to imply that all the land was, into as many sections as there were "mark families" - that is, families of freemen exclusive of the servile classes in the town. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/14-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Joseph</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1435;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;s&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3130.htm">Strong's 3130: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph -- 'he increases', a son of Jacob, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">became</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - mdc<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tribes,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4294.htm">Strong's 4294: </a> </span><span class="str2">A staff, rod, shaft, branch, a tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Manasseh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;na&#353;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4519.htm">Strong's 4519: </a> </span><span class="str2">Manasseh -- 'causing to forget', a son of Joseph, also a king of Judah, also two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Ephraim.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;r&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
