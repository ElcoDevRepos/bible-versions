The concept of "rest" in the Old Testament often signifies peace, security, and the fulfillment of God's promises. In this context, it refers to the Israelites settling in the Promised Land after their conquests. This rest is a foreshadowing of the ultimate rest found in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>, where the rest in the Promised Land is seen as a type of the spiritual rest believers find in Jesus. Historically, this rest was achieved when the Israelites were no longer at war and could settle in the land God had promised to their ancestors.<p><b>and your brothers also possess the land that the LORD your God is giving them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unity and shared mission among the tribes of Israel. The "brothers" refer to the other tribes who were to inherit land west of the Jordan River. The land was a gift from God, highlighting His sovereignty and faithfulness in fulfilling His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The distribution of the land is detailed in the book of Joshua, chapters 13-21, and reflects the fulfillment of God's promises. The phrase underscores the importance of collective responsibility and support among the tribes until all had received their inheritance.<p><b>Then you may return to the land of your inheritance</b><br>This refers to the specific inheritance given to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh on the east side of the Jordan River. These tribes had requested this land because it was suitable for their livestock (Numbers 32). Moses granted their request on the condition that they assist the other tribes in conquering the land west of the Jordan. This arrangement highlights the importance of fulfilling commitments and the principle of mutual aid within the community of God's people.<p><b>and take possession of that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the east side of the Jordan.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges Moses' role as the leader who allocated the land east of the Jordan to these tribes. It underscores the continuity of leadership from Moses to Joshua and the fulfillment of God's promises through His appointed leaders. The "east side of the Jordan" refers to the territories of Gilead and Bashan, which were rich in resources and strategically significant. This allocation was part of God's plan to establish Israel in the land, and it reflects the broader theme of divine providence and the unfolding of God's redemptive history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises rest and land to His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are to take possession of the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The geographical boundary that the Israelites must cross to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The servant of the LORD who led the Israelites out of Egypt and received the law from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_support_among_believers.htm">Unity and Support Among Believers</a></b><br>Just as the tribes were to support each other until all had rest, Christians are called to support one another in their spiritual journeys.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god's_promises.htm">Faithfulness to God's Promises</a></b><br>The Israelites' journey to the Promised Land is a testament to God's faithfulness.
