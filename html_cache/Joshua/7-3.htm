This reflects a common military strategy of reconnaissance, seen earlier when Joshua himself was sent as a spy to Canaan (Numbers 13). The act of reporting to Joshua underscores his leadership role, similar to Moses, and highlights the importance of seeking counsel and making informed decisions.<p><b>There is no need to send all the people</b><br>This phrase suggests overconfidence and a reliance on human judgment rather than seeking divine guidance. It contrasts with the earlier conquest of Jericho, where God's specific instructions were followed (Joshua 6). The decision not to involve the entire army may reflect a lack of understanding of the spiritual nature of their mission, emphasizing the need for dependence on God rather than human strength.<p><b>two or three thousand men are enough to go up and attack Ai</b><br>The recommendation to send only a small force indicates a misjudgment of the situation. Ai, though smaller than Jericho, was strategically significant. The number "two or three thousand" suggests a minimal effort, which can be seen as a lack of vigilance. This decision foreshadows the failure that results from underestimating the enemy and not seeking God's will.<p><b>Since the people of Ai are so few</b><br>This assessment of Ai's population reflects a focus on physical numbers rather than spiritual readiness. The Israelites' previous victory at Jericho might have led to complacency. The phrase highlights the danger of relying on appearances and underestimating challenges, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God reminds Samuel that He looks at the heart, not outward appearances.<p><b>you need not wear out all our people there</b><br>The concern for not exhausting the people shows a practical consideration for the well-being of the troops. However, it also reveals a lack of spiritual insight, as the true strength of Israel lay in obedience to God, not in conserving human resources. This phrase can be contrasted with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, which encourages believers not to grow weary in doing good, emphasizing perseverance in faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ai.htm">Ai</a></b><br>A small city near Bethel, which the Israelites attempted to conquer after their victory at Jericho.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_spies.htm">Israelite Spies</a></b><br>Sent by Joshua to scout the city of Ai and assess its defenses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_of_ai.htm">The Men of Ai</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Ai, perceived as few and weak by the Israelite spies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_defeat_at_ai.htm">The Defeat at Ai</a></b><br>Following the spies' report, the Israelites suffer an unexpected defeat due to hidden sin within the camp.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_presumption.htm">The Danger of Presumption</a></b><br>Presuming upon God's favor without seeking His guidance can lead to failure.

Yet <a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a> cautions, &#8220;Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.&#8221;<p>- Jonathan once said the opposite&#8212;&#8220;Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>). The spies reverse that logic, assuming &#8220;few&#8221; soldiers are automatically sufficient.<p>- When correction finally comes, Joshua mobilizes thirty thousand men under God&#8217;s directive (<a href="/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3&#8211;4</a>), proving that the Lord&#8212;not math&#8212;chooses the means.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since the people of Ai are so few</b><p>- The men see only the visible enemy, forgetting the invisible barrier of God&#8217;s displeasure (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>- David misread Goliath&#8217;s size as small compared to God (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>); these spies read Ai&#8217;s size as small compared to Israel, a subtle but fatal shift.<p>- Scripture consistently warns against despising &#8220;the day of small things&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>) because the Lord often uses small forces to display His power&#8212;or small obstacles to expose hidden sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you need not wear out all our people there</b><p>- Stewardship of troops is sensible (<a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>), yet true rest comes from obedience, not relaxation (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>).<p>- David stayed home &#8220;when kings go out to battle&#8221; and fell into sin (<a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1&#8211;4</a>); Israel now repeats the pattern by withholding effort when wholehearted engagement was required.<p>- Jesus later teaches His disciples to &#8220;watch and pray&#8221; rather than seek convenience (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>). Spiritual vigilance matters more than conserving energy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/7-3.htm">Joshua 7:3</a> records a confident, commonsense plan that inadvertently sidelines God&#8217;s voice. The spies return, recommend minimal force, and appeal to efficiency because Ai seems insignificant. Their assessment ignores the unseen factor of covenant holiness, leading to Israel&#8217;s defeat (<a href="/joshua/7-4.htm">Joshua 7:4-5</a>). The verse cautions against trusting human calculation, belittling small challenges, and substituting practicality for prayer. True victory depends on hearing and obeying the Lord, regardless of an enemy&#8217;s size or our own resources.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Make not all the people to labour thither.</span>--In these words we see, by a sort of side-glance, the (not unnatural) comment of Israel on the seven days' march round Jericho.
