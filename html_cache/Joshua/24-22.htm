This location is significant as it is where God first promised the land to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>). Joshua is nearing the end of his life and is reaffirming the covenant between God and Israel. His role as a leader is to guide the people in their commitment to God, emphasizing the importance of serving the LORD faithfully.<p><b>&#8220;You are witnesses against yourselves</b><br>Joshua is emphasizing personal accountability. In the ancient Near Eastern context, covenants often required witnesses to ensure the terms were upheld. Here, the Israelites themselves are the witnesses, highlighting the seriousness of their commitment. This self-witnessing underscores the personal responsibility each individual has in their relationship with God.<p><b>that you have chosen to serve the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>The choice to serve the LORD is a central theme in the book of Joshua. This decision is not just a verbal agreement but a commitment to live according to God's laws and commands. The act of choosing is significant, as it reflects the free will given by God to His people. This echoes the call to choose life and blessings by obeying God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>.<p><b>&#8220;We are witnesses!&#8221; they said.</b><br>The response of the Israelites indicates their agreement and acceptance of the covenant. This collective affirmation is crucial, as it shows unity and shared responsibility among the people. Their declaration is a public acknowledgment of their commitment to God, similar to the public confessions seen in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a>. This moment foreshadows the New Testament call for believers to be witnesses of Christ (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>), emphasizing the continuity of God's call for His people to testify to their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who guided the Israelites into the Promised Land.

Their words will later be evidence if they break the covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also anticipates the twelve-stone monument erected earlier (<a href="/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3-7</a>) and the large stone soon to be set up at Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24-26.htm">Joshua 24:26-27</a>); both are silent but enduring witnesses.<p>&#8226; Personal accountability is highlighted. Just as Achan&#8217;s sin had corporate fallout (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-26</a>), so national disobedience would bring consequences (<a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That you have chosen to serve the LORD</b><p>Service to the LORD (YHWH) is voluntary yet covenantal.<p>&#8226; Their &#8220;choice&#8221; affirms free, conscious commitment&#8212;mirroring Moses&#8217; call, &#8220;Choose life&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Service (Hebrew concept of worship-work) involves exclusive loyalty (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).

This echoes Israel&#8217;s earlier acceptance, &#8220;All that the LORD has spoken we will do&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Their declaration leaves no room for later denial&#8212;mirroring Peter&#8217;s bold pledge (<a href="/mark/14-29.htm">Mark 14:29-31</a>), with the sober reminder that promises must be kept (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua&#8217;s ensuing actions&#8212;recording the words in the Book of the Law and setting up a stone (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25-27</a>)&#8212;convert their spoken witness into permanent record.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/24-22.htm">Joshua 24:22</a> crystallizes a covenant moment. God&#8217;s leader confronts Israel with their own words, making them legal witnesses to their declared choice. The verse teaches that confession of loyalty to the LORD carries binding accountability, demands exclusive service, and establishes a testimony that will stand for or against us in the future.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are witnesses against yourselves.</span> Joshua has not disguised from them the difficulty of the task they have undertaken. Like a true guide and father, he has placed the case fully and fairly before them, and they have made their choice. He reminds them that their own words so deliberately uttered will be forever witnesses against them, should they afterwards refuse to keep an engagement into which they entered with their eyes open. They do not in any way shrink from the responsibility, and by accepting the situation as it is placed before them, render it impossible henceforth to plead ignorance or surprise as an excuse for their disobedience. And it is well to observe, as has been remarked above, that such an excuse never was pleaded afterwards, that the obligation, though evaded, was never disavowed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/24-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1436;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
