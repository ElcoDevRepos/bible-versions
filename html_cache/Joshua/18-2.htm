At this point in the narrative, the Israelites have entered Canaan under Joshua's leadership. The seven tribes mentioned here are Benjamin, Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan. This situation highlights a period of transition and incomplete conquest, as the tribes had not yet fully taken possession of their allotted territories. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, which may underscore the importance of completing the task of settling the land.<p><b>who had not yet received their inheritance</b><br>The term "inheritance" refers to the land that God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This promise is a central theme in the Old Testament, beginning with God's covenant with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>. The delay in receiving their inheritance may reflect a lack of initiative or faith among the tribes, as well as the challenges of displacing the existing Canaanite inhabitants. This situation also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, despite human shortcomings. The concept of inheritance is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are described as heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), pointing to a spiritual inheritance that transcends earthly possessions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land and overseeing the distribution of the land among the tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_tribes_of_israel.htm">Seven Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>These are the tribes that had not yet received their inheritance in the Promised Land.

The conquest of the Canaanitish armies being completed, the two leading divisions of the host of Israel took possession of their shares of the conquered territory. The house of Judah and the house of Joseph were satisfied. This done, the weaker tribes were left to take care of themselves. They did not venture to select their own portions; the others did not come forward to offer them anything.
