The decision to let them live is significant in the context of the covenant made before God, highlighting the importance of keeping one's word even when made under false pretenses. This decision aligns with the biblical principle of honoring oaths (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>).<p><b>but let them be woodcutters and water carriers</b><br>The role of woodcutters and water carriers was a menial and servile position, often assigned to the lowest social classes or foreigners. This decision ensured the Gibeonites' survival while placing them in a position of servitude. This reflects the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, where conquered peoples were often subjected to forced labor. The Gibeonites' role can be seen as a type of servitude that points to the servitude of sin and the need for redemption, which is fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>).<p><b>for the whole congregation.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase indicates that the Gibeonites were to serve the entire community of Israel, not just a specific tribe or group. This communal aspect underscores the unity and collective responsibility of the Israelite nation. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of service and humility, as seen in the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who emphasized serving others (<a href="/mark/10-44.htm">Mark 10:44-45</a>).<p><b>So the leaders kept their promise.</b><br>This statement highlights the integrity and faithfulness of the Israelite leaders in upholding their covenant, despite the deception involved. It serves as a reminder of the importance of faithfulness and truthfulness in leadership. This act of keeping their promise can be connected to the character of God, who is always faithful to His promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who is the faithful and true witness (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

Their &#8220;continuing&#8221; highlights deliberate, thoughtful leadership rather than rash reaction, much like Joshua&#8217;s earlier pause to seek the Lord before battle (<a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6-9</a>). It reminds us that steady obedience often involves ongoing dialogue and discernment (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let them live</b><p>The leaders honor the oath they had sworn &#8220;by the LORD, the God of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/9-19.htm">Joshua 9:19</a>). Even though the covenant was secured through trickery, the sanctity of their vow stands (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a>). By sparing Gibeon, Israel models the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a> to keep promises made in God&#8217;s name. Centuries later, Saul&#8217;s violation of this oath brought judgment on Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-2</a>), underscoring how seriously God views covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but let them be woodcutters and water carriers</b><p>Granting life does not remove consequences. The Gibeonites receive a lifelong servant role that keeps them close to Israel&#8217;s worship life:<p>&#8226; Woodcutters&#8212;supplying fuel for sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Water carriers&#8212;providing cleansing water for priests and people (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>).<p>This arrangement mercifully spares them yet also disciplines their deceit, echoing <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a> where work becomes toil after sin. It illustrates how God can fold human failure into His purposes, turning deception into service that supports His sanctuary (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the whole congregation</b><p>Service is not limited to a single tribe but benefits the entire nation, reflecting God&#8217;s inclusive concern for unity (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>). By placing foreigners in roles that sustain worship, the Lord foreshadows His plan to bring the nations into His house (<a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-7</a>). The congregation&#8217;s daily sacrifices now depend on people once outside the covenant&#8212;a living picture of grace extending beyond ethnic boundaries (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the leaders kept their promise</b><p>Leadership integrity stands out. Joshua and the princes choose obedience over expedience, valuing God&#8217;s honor above public opinion (<a href="/joshua/9-18.htm">Joshua 9:18</a>). Their fidelity nurtures trust within Israel and sets a precedent for future leaders like David (<a href="/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4-5</a>). It also confronts us with the call to keep our word&#8212;even when costly (<a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21</a> portrays a balanced response of mercy and justice. Israel spares the Gibeonites because a vow before the Lord is unbreakable, yet assigns them servant roles that both discipline their deceit and weave them into Israel&#8217;s worship life. The passage underscores the seriousness of oaths, the wisdom of measured leadership, and God&#8217;s ability to transform even flawed situations into avenues for His grace and glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Said unto them,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">But let them be.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">and they were</span>, with Rosenmuller and Keil. See Keil <span class="accented">in loc.</span> for the force of the Vau conversive. The LXX. and Vulgate render as our version. <span class="cmt_word">Hewers of wood and drawers of water.</span> Some amount of casuistry has been displayed upon this passage. But the fairness of the proceeding seems clear enough. The Gibeonites had escaped death by a fraud. For that fraud they deserved punishment. Their lives were spared by virtue of a solemn oath. But equality of rights had never been promised them. They might think themselves well off if they escaped destruction, even though they might be condemned permanently to occupy a servile condition. They appear to have assisted at the tabernacle worship, since they were condemned to serve, not individual Israelites, but the congregation. Such was the office of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (Nethinhim <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the given or devoted) in the later history of Judah (see <a href="/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43-54, 58, 70</a>; and Ezra 8:20. See also Drusius and Masius <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The latter discusses the question whether the Nethinim were really the Gibeonites, or whether David, as stated in <a href="/ezra/8-20.htm">Ezra 8:20</a>, instituted a new order of persons to take their place. If the latter were the case, then we have a proof that the Book of Joshua was written anterior to the time of David. It seems quite possible that Saul (<a href="/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>) had all but exterminated the Gibeonites, and that David was compelled to institute a new order in their stead. If this suggestion be correct, and it is far from improbable, we have here an undesigned coincidence strongly supporting the credit of the narrative, in the place of Knobel's insinuation, contained in the words, that "the Elohist in Saul's time gives no hint of this, although he took the greatest interest in the persons engaged in God's service." <span class="cmt_word">As the princes had promised them.</span> These words as they stand are unintelligible. No such promise had been given. The literal rendering is "as the princes" (see note on ver. 15) "said to them," by the mouth of Joshua, as recorded in ver. 23. The Syriac Version supplies some words here to make up for a supposed deficiency in the text. But this is not necessary. The repetition in vers. 23 and 27 is quite in the manner of the historian. Nor are the words "as the princes said to them" explicable on the supposition that the words after, "let them live," are the words of the princes (see note above). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/9-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
