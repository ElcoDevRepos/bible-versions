It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where service to the LORD is not coerced but chosen. The context is Joshua's farewell address, urging the Israelites to remain faithful to the covenant established at Sinai. The concept of serving God is central to Israel's identity, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>, where serving the LORD is tied to fearing Him and swearing by His name.<p><b>then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve,</b><br>The urgency of "this day" emphasizes the immediacy of the decision. The call to choose reflects the covenant renewal ceremony, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where vassals reaffirmed their loyalty to a suzerain. This choice is not just a personal decision but a communal one, affecting the entire nation. The idea of choosing whom to serve is echoed in Elijah's challenge to Israel in <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, where he calls the people to decide between the LORD and Baal.<p><b>whether the gods your fathers served beyond the Euphrates,</b><br>This refers to the ancestral gods worshiped by the patriarchs before Abraham's call, as seen in <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, where Terah, Abraham's father, lived in Ur of the Chaldeans. The Euphrates River represents a geographical boundary, symbolizing a spiritual boundary as well. The mention of these gods serves as a reminder of the idolatry from which God called Abraham, establishing a new covenant relationship with him and his descendants.<p><b>or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living.</b><br>The Amorites were one of the Canaanite peoples inhabiting the Promised Land. Their gods, such as Baal and Asherah, were associated with fertility and agriculture, appealing to the Israelites living in a land dependent on these elements. The cultural and religious influence of the Amorites posed a constant temptation to Israel, as seen in <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>, where the Israelites repeatedly turned to Canaanite deities, leading to cycles of apostasy and repentance.<p><b>As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD!&#8221;</b><br>Joshua's declaration is a personal and familial commitment to the LORD, setting an example for the nation. This statement underscores the importance of leadership and personal responsibility in spiritual matters. Joshua's resolve mirrors the call to love and serve God wholeheartedly, as commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>. It also foreshadows the New Testament call to follow Christ, where believers are urged to choose whom they will serve, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, where Jesus teaches that one cannot serve two masters.

God never forces allegiance; He invites willing devotion, as <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> calls believers to offer themselves &#8220;as a living sacrifice.&#8221; The possibility that serving the LORD could be deemed unpleasant warns us to check whether convenience, culture, or comfort is shaping our choices more than gratitude for redemption (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve</b><p>&#8220;Choose&#8221; underlines personal responsibility.

Returning to those gods would rewrite salvation history, ignoring the LORD&#8217;s mighty acts from the call of Abraham to the parting of the Jordan. The warning parallels Paul&#8217;s plea in <a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>: &#8220;How is it that you are turning back to those weak and worthless principles?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living</b><p>Canaan&#8217;s prevailing religions celebrated fertility rites, violence, and child sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). Israel now dwelt amid these influences; compromise seemed easier than consecration. <a href="/psalms/106-35.htm">Psalm 106:35-38</a> records how succumbing to local gods led to devastating sin. Jesus later prays for His disciples to remain in the world yet not of it (<a href="/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15-16</a>), highlighting the timeless struggle to avoid cultural assimilation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD!</b><p>Joshua&#8217;s resolve is both personal and patriarchal. He speaks for his household, modeling godly leadership (<a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>). The verb &#8220;will serve&#8221; shows settled commitment, akin to the apostles&#8217; declaration, &#8220;We must obey God rather than men&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>). His stance testifies that public confession strengthens private obedience and influences others (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a> confronts every believer with a clear-cut decision: wholehearted service to the LORD or allegiance to alternative gods&#8212;whether ancestral traditions or surrounding culture. The verse insists on immediate, personal, and public commitment, while illustrating how a leader&#8217;s unwavering choice can guide an entire household toward faithful worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The Amorites.</span>--Here used generically for the inhabitants of Canaan.<p><span class= "bld">As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</span>--For Joshua himself the service of Jehovah on earth was nearly over. He pledges his "house" to the same service. What is known of his family? It is a singular fact that <span class= "ital">no descendant of the great conqueror, no member of his household, is named in the Bible. </span>In the genealogies of Ephraim in 1 Chronicles 7, Joshua's name is the last in his own line (<a href="/joshua/24-27.htm" title="And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us: it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest you deny your God.">Joshua 24:27</a> : "Non his son, Jehoshuah his son"). I cannot but regard the silence of Scripture under this head as profoundly significant. It is one more analogy between the Joshua of the Old Testament and his great Antitype in the Gospel: "<span class= "ital">whose house are we, </span>if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end" (<a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>). The house of Joshua embraces all the faithful servants of the Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell.</span> There is a <span class="accented">reductio ad absurdum</span> here. "Had ye served those gods ye would never have been here, nor would the Amorites have been driven out before you." The reference to the gods of their fathers seems to be intended to suggest the idea of an era long since lost in the past, and thrown into the background by the splendid deliverances and wonders which Jehovah had wrought among them. <span class="cmt_word">But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</span> Or, <span class="accented">Jehovah.</span> Here speaks the sturdy old warrior, who had led them to victory in many a battle. He invites them, as Elijah did on another even more memorable occasion, to make their choice between the false worship and the true, between the present and the future, between the indulgence of their lusts and the approval of their conscience. But as for himself, his choice is already made. No desire to stand well with the children of Israel obscures the clearness of his vision. No temptations of this lower world pervert his sense of truth. The experience of a life spent in His service has convinced him that Jehovah is the true God. And from that conviction he does not intend to swerve. In days when faith is weak and compromise has become general, when the sense of duty is slight or the definitions of duty vague, it is well that the spirit of Joshua should be displayed among the leaders in Israel, and that there should be those who will take their stand boldly upon the declaration," But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/24-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
