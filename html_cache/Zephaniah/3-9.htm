The "pure lips" symbolize a return to sincere and truthful speech, contrasting with the deceit and idolatry prevalent in Zephaniah's time. The restoration suggests a divine intervention where God cleanses the speech of the nations, reminiscent of the reversal of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where language was confused. This purification aligns with the prophetic vision of a unified worship of God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5-7</a>, where the prophet's lips are cleansed by a coal from the altar.<p><b>that all may call upon the name of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal scope of God's redemptive plan. "Call upon the name of the LORD" is a biblical expression for worship and reliance on God, seen in passages like <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a> and <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>. It signifies a personal and communal relationship with God, where people acknowledge His sovereignty and seek His guidance. This calling is not limited to Israel but extends to all nations, fulfilling the Abrahamic promise that all families of the earth will be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and serve Him shoulder to shoulder</b><br>The imagery of serving "shoulder to shoulder" conveys unity and cooperation among the peoples in their worship and service to God. It suggests a harmonious community working together in God's service, reflecting the ideal of the body of Christ as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>. This unity is a foretaste of the eschatological hope where divisions are healed, and all believers are united in their devotion to God. The phrase also implies a return to the intended order of creation, where humanity works together in stewardship and worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zephaniah.htm">Zephaniah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Zephaniah's ministry was during the reign of King Josiah of Judah.

Judgment is never God&#8217;s last word; restoration is. We see the same pattern in <a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25&#8211;26</a>, where purification is followed by renewal, and in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>, where blessing comes after repentance.
