Moab was often in conflict with Israel, and their reproach refers to their disdain and hostility towards God's people. Historically, Moab was located east of the Dead Sea, and its relationship with Israel was marked by both conflict and occasional alliances. The reproach could also be seen as a fulfillment of earlier prophecies against Moab, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15-16</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>.<p><b>and the insults of the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites, like the Moabites, were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>) and had a history of enmity with Israel. Their insults reflect a deeper animosity and contempt. The Ammonites occupied territory northeast of Moab, and their hostility is documented in several biblical accounts, including their opposition during the time of the Judges (Judges 10-11) and their alliance with other nations against Israel (2 Samuel 10). The insults may also be seen as a violation of the covenantal relationship God had with Israel, as the Ammonites were often aggressors against God's chosen people.<p><b>who have taunted My people</b><br>The taunting of God's people by Moab and Ammon is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where surrounding nations often mocked and derided Israel. This taunting is not just verbal but also involves actions that undermine and threaten Israel's security and well-being. The phrase underscores the spiritual and moral implications of such behavior, as it is ultimately an affront to God Himself. This taunting is reminiscent of other instances where nations mocked Israel, such as the Philistines in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a> with Goliath's challenge.<p><b>and threatened their borders.</b><br>The threat to Israel's borders by Moab and Ammon highlights the geopolitical tensions of the time. Borders in the ancient Near East were often fluid and contested, and the security of a nation's borders was crucial for its survival. This threat is not only a physical one but also a spiritual challenge, as it represents an attempt to undermine the land that God had promised to His people. The protection of Israel's borders is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, with God often intervening to defend His people, as seen in the accounts of various battles and divine deliverances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, located east of the Dead Sea.
