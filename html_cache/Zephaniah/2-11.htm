In the context of Zephaniah, this refers to the judgment that God will bring upon the nations surrounding Judah. The terror of the LORD is a common theme in the prophetic books, where God's power and holiness are emphasized. This fear is not just emotional but a recognition of God's supreme authority and justice, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19-21</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>.<p><b>when He starves all the gods of the earth.</b><br>This phrase suggests the futility and impotence of the pagan gods worshiped by the nations. The "starving" of these gods implies the removal of their power and influence, as they are shown to be nothing before the true God. This can be connected to the plagues of Egypt in Exodus, where the LORD demonstrated His superiority over the Egyptian deities. It also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of false gods and idols, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/46.htm">Isaiah 46:1-2</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>.<p><b>Then the nations of every shore</b><br>This phrase highlights the universal scope of God's dominion. "Every shore" suggests the farthest reaches of the known world, indicating that God's influence and authority extend beyond Israel to all nations. This is consistent with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all creation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/97.htm">Psalm 97:1</a> and <a href="/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>. It also points to the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, a theme further developed in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p><b>will bow in worship to Him,</b><br>This phrase speaks to the ultimate recognition and submission to God's authority by all peoples. The act of bowing is a sign of reverence and acknowledgment of God's supremacy. This prophetic vision aligns with the eschatological hope found in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow to Jesus Christ. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations will be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>).<p><b>each in its own place.</b><br>This phrase suggests that worship of the LORD will be widespread and not confined to a single location, such as the temple in Jerusalem. It anticipates a time when true worship will be offered by people everywhere, as Jesus described in <a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>, where worship is not tied to a specific place but is in spirit and truth. This also points to the diverse and global nature of the future worshiping community, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language stands before the throne of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God of Israel, who is sovereign over all nations and gods.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentile nations surrounding Israel, who worship false gods.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gods_of_the_earth.htm">The Gods of the Earth</a></b><br>Represents the idols and false deities worshiped by the nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zephaniah.htm">Zephaniah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_worship.htm">Judgment and Worship</a></b><br>The event where God will demonstrate His power over false gods, leading to the nations recognizing His sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_idols.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Idols</a></b><br>God will demonstrate His power by rendering the false gods powerless.

This encourages us to participate in God's mission to make His name known among all peoples.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is ultimately futile and leads to spiritual starvation.

This reflects His desire for all to come to repentance and faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_diversity_in_worship.htm">Cultural Diversity in Worship</a></b><br>The phrase "each in its own place" suggests that worship will be diverse yet unified in its focus on God.
