The phrase "as surely as I live" is an oath, underscoring the seriousness and inevitability of the prophecy. The title "LORD of Hosts" highlights God's supreme command over heavenly armies, indicating His power to execute judgment. "The God of Israel" reaffirms His covenant relationship with Israel, contrasting His favor towards Israel with His judgment against their enemies.<p><b>surely Moab will be like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah&#8212;</b><br>Moab and Ammon, descendants of Lot, are compared to Sodom and Gomorrah, cities destroyed for their wickedness (Genesis 19). This comparison indicates total destruction due to their pride and hostility towards Israel. Historically, Moab and Ammon were neighboring nations east of Israel, often in conflict with God's people. The reference to Sodom and Gomorrah serves as a warning of divine retribution for sin.<p><b>a place of weeds and salt pits, a perpetual wasteland.</b><br>This imagery describes complete desolation. Weeds and salt pits suggest uninhabitable land, reflecting the aftermath of divine judgment. Salt, often associated with barrenness, symbolizes the irreversible nature of their destruction. The term "perpetual wasteland" indicates a lasting judgment, emphasizing the severity of God's wrath against sin and rebellion.<p><b>The remnant of My people will plunder them;</b><br>The "remnant" refers to the faithful survivors of Israel who will experience restoration and victory. This promise of plundering their enemies signifies a reversal of fortunes, where those who were oppressed will triumph over their oppressors. It reflects God's faithfulness to His covenant people, ensuring their ultimate vindication and blessing.<p><b>the remainder of My nation will dispossess them.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase continues the theme of reversal and restoration. "Dispossess" implies taking over the land and possessions of Moab and Ammon, fulfilling God's promise of inheritance to His people. It highlights the theme of divine justice, where the enemies of God's people are judged, and His people are established. This also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, where His people will inherit the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.

"There are no settled inhabitants," says Dr. Porter, writing of Moab, "but the hillsides and glens are studded with the ruins of ancient towns and villages. We at length pitched our tents by the lonely fountain of Heshbon. The site of this royal city is commanding - a rounded hilt on the edge of avast plateau, which extends on the south and east to the horizon, and on the west breaks down in steep slopes, jagged cliffs, and wild ravines, to the Dead Sea and Jordan valley, nearly four thousand feet below. The hill was the nucleus of the city. Its sides are covered with ruins, and remains of houses, temples, and other buildings are strewn over a considerable section of the adjoining plain. All is desolate. Not a building, and scarcely a fragment of a wall, is standing; yet, though deserted for centuries, it bears its ancient name. I looked from Heshbon far and wide over the ancient territory of the Moabites, and saw desolation everywhere. The old towns and villages are all deserted and in ruins. In fact, there is not at this moment a single inhabited town or village in Moab, except Kerak, which stands on the extreme southern border. The sites of many were visible - grey mounds dotting the plain" ('Illust. of Bible Proph.,' pp. 24, 25). "The cities, towns, villages, are all in ruins. ... And no attempt is ever made to rebuild or repair; no man ventures to seek even a temporary abode among the ruined cities of Moab. The local Arab avoids the old sites, and seeks rest and security amid rocks and ravines; the powerful desert tribes sweep over the country periodically, and devour and destroy all in their track" (ibid., p. 28). <span class="cmt_word">Even the breeding of nettles;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a possession of nettles</span>; a place where nettles only grow.
