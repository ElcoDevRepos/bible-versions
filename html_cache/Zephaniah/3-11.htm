In the prophetic literature, "that day" often signifies the Day of the Lord, a time when God will act decisively in history. It is a day of both judgment and salvation, emphasizing God's sovereignty over time and events.<p><b>you will not be put to shame</b><br>Shame in the biblical context often relates to the consequences of sin and disobedience. Here, the promise is of a future where the people will no longer experience the disgrace associated with their past sins. This reflects God's forgiveness and the restoration of honor to His people.<p><b>for any of the deeds by which you have transgressed against Me</b><br>This acknowledges the people's past sins and rebellion against God. Transgression implies a willful violation of God's law. The promise of not being put to shame for these deeds highlights God's mercy and the possibility of redemption and cleansing from sin.<p><b>For then I will remove from among you those who rejoice in their pride</b><br>Pride is a significant sin in biblical teaching, often leading to downfall and separation from God. The removal of the proud indicates a purification process, where God will eliminate those who exalt themselves, ensuring that the community is humble and righteous. This aligns with the biblical theme that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.<p><b>and you will never again be haughty on My holy mountain</b><br>The "holy mountain" refers to Jerusalem, specifically Mount Zion, which holds religious and cultural significance as the center of worship and God's presence. The promise that the people will no longer be haughty signifies a transformation in their character and worship practices.
