Silence in the presence of God is a common biblical theme, seen in <a href="/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a> and <a href="/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>, where silence signifies respect and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. The Hebrew term for "Lord GOD" here is "Adonai Yahweh," highlighting both His lordship and covenant relationship with Israel. This call to silence may also reflect the solemnity of the impending judgment.<p><b>for the Day of the LORD is near</b><br>The "Day of the LORD" is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, referring to a time of divine intervention, judgment, and salvation. It is a day when God will execute justice, often associated with both immediate historical events and eschatological fulfillment. In Zephaniah's context, it likely points to the impending Babylonian invasion, but it also foreshadows the ultimate Day of Judgment. This phrase underscores the urgency and imminence of God's action.<p><b>Indeed, the LORD has prepared a sacrifice</b><br>The imagery of sacrifice here is significant. In the Old Testament, sacrifices were central to worship and atonement. However, in this context, the "sacrifice" is metaphorical, referring to the people of Judah who will face judgment. This reversal of roles, where the people become the sacrifice, highlights the severity of their sin and the seriousness of God's judgment. It also connects to the sacrificial system, pointing forward to Christ as the ultimate sacrifice for sin.<p><b>He has consecrated His guests</b><br>The term "consecrated" implies setting apart for a holy purpose. In ancient Near Eastern culture, guests invited to a sacrificial feast were often considered honored participants. Here, however, the guests are likely the instruments of God's judgment, such as the Babylonians, who are set apart to execute His will. This phrase illustrates God's sovereign control over nations and events, using them to fulfill His purposes. It also serves as a reminder of the holiness required to approach God, ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who consecrates believers through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign and holy God of Israel, who is the central figure in this passage, calling for silence and reverence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the LORD</a></b><br>A significant event in biblical prophecy, often associated with judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sacrifice.htm">The Sacrifice</a></b><br>Symbolic of the judgment and purification that God will bring upon the people, possibly referring to the impending judgment on Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_guests.htm">The Guests</a></b><br>Those who are consecrated or set apart by God, possibly referring to the people of Judah or the nations involved in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_before_god.htm">Reverence Before God</a></b><br>The call to "be silent" emphasizes the need for reverence and awe in the presence of God.

These are said to be "sanctified," as if engaged in a holy war, when summoned to punish those who had become as heathen. So those who are called to chastise Babylon are termed "my sanctified ones" (<a href="/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>), as being the instruments appointed and set apart to carry out this purpose (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27, 28</a>; <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>). The particular agents intended are not specified by the prophet, whose mission was not directed to any such definition. He has to speak generally of the judgment to come, not of those whom God should employ to inflict it. We know from other sources that the Chaldeans are meant, they or the Assyrians being always announced as the executors of God's vengeance on his rebellions people. The notion, adopted by Ewald, Hitzig, and others, that the prophet refers to some supposed invasion of Scythians which took place about this time, would never have been started had not such authors desired to eliminate the predictive element from prophetic utterances. The vague account of Herod., 1:105 gives no support to the assertion that the Scythians invaded Palestine in Josiah's reign; nor is there a trace of any knowledge of such irruption in Zephaniah or Jeremiah (see Introduction, &sect; I.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Be silent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1429;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(has)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2013.htm">Strong's 2013: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hush! keep silence!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the presence</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mip&#183;p&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
