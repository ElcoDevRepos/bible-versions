In this context, it is directed towards Jerusalem, a city that had become corrupt and oppressive. The city of oppressors refers to the leaders and inhabitants who exploited the vulnerable, contrary to God's commands for justice and righteousness. This echoes the warnings given by other prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, who also condemned the social injustices and moral decay in Jerusalem. The oppression here is not only social but also spiritual, as the leaders led the people away from God's laws.<p><b>rebellious</b><br>Rebellion against God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel is often depicted as a wayward nation. This rebellion is not just political but spiritual, as the people turned away from God's covenant and pursued idolatry and pagan practices. The rebellion of Jerusalem is reminiscent of the Israelites' repeated disobedience during their wilderness journey and the period of the Judges. This phrase highlights the city's refusal to heed prophetic warnings and return to God, leading to its downfall.<p><b>and defiled!</b><br>Defilement in a biblical sense often refers to ritual impurity and moral corruption. Jerusalem, once a holy city, had become defiled through idolatry, injustice, and the shedding of innocent blood. This defilement made the city unfit for God's presence, as seen in the temple's desecration. The concept of defilement is significant in the Levitical laws, where purity was essential for worship and community life. The defilement of Jerusalem serves as a type of the greater defilement of humanity, which is ultimately cleansed through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who restores purity and holiness to those who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>This refers to Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, which had become corrupt and rebellious against God.
