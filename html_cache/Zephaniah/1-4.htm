The imagery of God stretching out His hand is a common biblical metaphor for divine action, often associated with judgment or deliverance (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>). Historically, this prophecy is set during the reign of King Josiah, a time of religious reform, yet the people had not fully turned from idolatry. The focus on Judah and Jerusalem highlights the centrality of these locations in Jewish worship and governance, underscoring the seriousness of their apostasy.<p><b>I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal,</b><br>Baal worship was a persistent issue in Israel's history, representing a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh. The phrase "cut off" suggests a complete eradication, reflecting God's intolerance for idolatry. Baal was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility and storms, and his worship often involved immoral practices. The presence of Baal worship in Judah indicates the syncretism that had infiltrated the religious life of the people, despite previous reforms. This judgment aligns with the first commandment, which prohibits the worship of other gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>the names of the idolatrous and pagan priests&#8212;</b><br>The mention of "idolatrous and pagan priests" points to the religious leaders who facilitated and promoted the worship of false gods. These priests were likely involved in rituals that were abominable to Yahweh, leading the people astray. The cutting off of their names signifies not only their physical removal but also the erasure of their influence and legacy. This action fulfills the Deuteronomic law that prescribes the destruction of idolatrous priests (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>). The focus on names also suggests a deeper spiritual cleansing, as names in the biblical context often represent character and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
