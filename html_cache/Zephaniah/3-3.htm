In the ancient Near East, lions were symbols of power and ferocity. This metaphor suggests that the princes, or leaders, are oppressive and predatory, exploiting their power for personal gain. The lion imagery is also used in other parts of Scripture to describe destructive leaders, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/22-25.htm">Ezekiel 22:25</a>, where the princes are likened to roaring lions tearing their prey. This reflects a failure in leadership, as they are meant to protect and serve the people, not devour them.<p><b>her judges are evening wolves,</b><br>The comparison of judges to "evening wolves" highlights their greed and rapacity. Wolves hunt at night, and the evening is when they are most active and dangerous. This suggests that the judges are corrupt, seeking to devour and exploit the people under the cover of darkness. In biblical times, judges were expected to uphold justice and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>. However, these judges are depicted as doing the opposite, preying on the vulnerable instead of defending them. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, where the Chaldeans are described as wolves, emphasizing their swift and ruthless nature.<p><b>leaving nothing for the morning.</b><br>The phrase "leaving nothing for the morning" indicates the complete and utter consumption by these corrupt leaders. By morning, nothing is left, signifying the total devastation and exploitation of the people. This reflects a society where justice and righteousness have been entirely consumed by greed and corruption. The imagery of leaving nothing behind is reminiscent of the locusts in <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>, which leave the land barren. This phrase underscores the urgency of the need for reform and the dire consequences of unchecked corruption. It also serves as a warning of impending judgment, as God will not allow such injustice to continue indefinitely.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/princes.htm">Princes</a></b><br>These are the leaders or rulers of Jerusalem, who are described metaphorically as "roaring lions," indicating their oppressive and predatory nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>The judicial authorities in Jerusalem, likened to "evening wolves," suggesting their greed and the way they devour the people they are meant to protect.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city being addressed in this passage, representing the center of Judah's political and religious life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zephaniah.htm">Zephaniah</a></b><br>The prophet delivering God's message, calling out the corruption and injustice in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_jerusalem.htm">The People of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The citizens who suffer under the corrupt leadership and are the intended audience of Zephaniah's warning.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_corrupt_leadership.htm">The Dangers of Corrupt Leadership</a></b><br>Corrupt leaders are likened to predators, emphasizing the destructive impact they have on society.
