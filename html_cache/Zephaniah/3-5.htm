In the context of Zephaniah, the prophet is addressing the moral and spiritual decay of Judah. Despite the corruption around, God's character remains untainted. This reflects the biblical theme of God's holiness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the seraphim declare God's holiness. The presence of the Lord within the city signifies His desire for a covenant relationship with His people, reminiscent of His dwelling in the tabernacle and later the temple (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>).<p><b>He does no wrong.</b><br>This statement underscores God's perfect nature, contrasting with the sinful behavior of the people. It aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, which describes God as a "Rock" whose works are perfect. Theologically, this affirms God's immutability and moral perfection, essential attributes that assure believers of His trustworthiness and justice.<p><b>He applies His justice morning by morning;</b><br>The phrase "morning by morning" suggests the regularity and consistency of God's justice. In ancient Near Eastern culture, morning was often associated with the time for legal proceedings and judgments. This reflects <a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a>, where God's mercies are described as new every morning. It indicates God's continual oversight and governance, ensuring that justice is not delayed or forgotten.<p><b>He does not fail at dawn,</b><br>This phrase reinforces the reliability and steadfastness of God's justice. The dawn symbolizes a new beginning, and God's unfailing nature at this time signifies His readiness to act righteously. This can be connected to <a href="/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, where God is described as being in the midst of His city, ensuring it will not fall. It assures believers of God's constant vigilance and faithfulness.<p><b>yet the unjust know no shame.</b><br>Here, the prophet contrasts God's righteousness with the people's shamelessness. Despite God's presence and justice, the unjust remain unrepentant. This echoes <a href="/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>, where the people are described as having no shame for their abominations. It highlights the hardness of heart and moral insensitivity that can develop when people persist in sin, serving as a warning to remain sensitive to God's conviction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's presence and His righteous nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem (implied)</a></b><br>The city where the LORD is present, often representing the people of Judah and their spiritual state.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unjust.htm">The Unjust</a></b><br>Those who live in opposition to God's righteousness, characterized by their lack of shame and persistent wrongdoing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteousness_is_unchanging.htm">God's Righteousness is Unchanging</a></b><br>God's nature is inherently righteous, and He does no wrong.

No matter how compromised the city becomes, the character of the LORD remains pure and unchanging.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He does no wrong</b><p>Scripture consistently testifies that God&#8217;s actions are flawless.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> proclaims, &#8220;A God of faithfulness, without injustice; righteous and upright is He.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a> affirms that with Him &#8220;there is no variation or shifting shadow.&#8221;<p>Even when discipline comes, it is never capricious or unfair.

God, present within His people, remains perfectly righteous, active, and reliable every single morning. He never errs, never misses a case, never grows weary. Yet those who reject Him grow increasingly insensitive to conviction. The verse calls us to stand on the side of the righteous LORD&#8212;welcoming His daily justice, repenting quickly, and refusing the numbness that marks the unjust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - In the midst of this congregation of sinners God is continually manifesting his righteousness; he leaves not himself without witness; and therefore their iniquities are without excuse. <span class="cmt_word">The just Lord is in the midst thereof;</span> or, <span class="accented">the Lord in the midst of her is righteous</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).
