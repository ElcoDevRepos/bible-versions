The appointed feasts refer to the sacred festivals commanded in the Law of Moses, such as Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. These feasts were central to Jewish worship and identity, and their disruption would have been deeply distressing. The promise to "gather" suggests a future restoration and return to proper worship, echoing themes found in other prophetic books like <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>. This gathering can also be seen as a type of Christ's work in uniting believers, as seen in <a href="/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>, where Jesus' death is said to gather the scattered children of God.<p><b>so that you will no longer suffer reproach</b><br>The reproach mentioned here refers to the shame and disgrace experienced by the Israelites due to their inability to observe their religious customs and the scorn from surrounding nations. Historically, Israel's exile and subjugation by foreign powers led to a loss of national and religious identity, which was a source of humiliation. The promise of no longer suffering reproach indicates a future vindication and restoration of honor, aligning with prophecies of redemption and renewal found in <a href="/ezekiel/36-30.htm">Ezekiel 36:30</a> and <a href="/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>. This also prefigures the ultimate redemption through Christ, who removes the reproach of sin and restores believers to a place of honor before God, as seen in <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a> and <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zephaniah.htm">Zephaniah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Zephaniah's ministry took place during the reign of King Josiah of Judah.
