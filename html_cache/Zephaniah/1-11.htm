The call to "wail" is a prophetic warning of impending judgment. This lamentation is a common prophetic motif, urging the people to mourn in anticipation of divine retribution. The wailing signifies the seriousness of the coming disaster, reflecting the deep sorrow and loss that will be experienced. This echoes other biblical calls to repentance and mourning, such as in <a href="/joel/1-5.htm">Joel 1:5</a> and <a href="/james/4-9.htm">James 4:9</a>.<p><b>for all your merchants will be silenced;</b><br>Merchants were vital to the economic life of ancient cities, and their silencing indicates a cessation of commercial activity. This judgment against the merchants suggests a broader economic collapse, which would have been devastating for a society heavily reliant on trade. The silencing of merchants can also symbolize the end of dishonest practices, as commerce in biblical times was often associated with greed and exploitation, as seen in <a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5-6</a>. This phrase underscores the theme of divine justice against economic corruption.<p><b>all who weigh out silver will be cut off.</b><br>Weighing out silver refers to the practice of measuring currency for trade, a common activity in ancient marketplaces. Being "cut off" implies a complete cessation of their business and possibly their lives, indicating severe judgment. This phrase highlights the futility of relying on wealth and economic power, a recurring biblical theme. It serves as a reminder of the transient nature of material wealth, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a> and <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5:1-3</a>. The cutting off of those who weigh silver also points to the broader theme of divine retribution against those who prioritize wealth over righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dwellers_of_the_hollow.htm">Dwellers of the Hollow</a></b><br>This refers to the inhabitants of a specific area in Jerusalem, likely a marketplace or commercial district known for its economic activity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/merchants.htm">Merchants</a></b><br>These are the traders and business people who conduct commerce in the city.

Their daily routines feel secure, yet God warns that judgment is imminent&#8212;just as He earlier told the city to &#8220;wail&#8221; over coming destruction (<a href="/zephaniah/1-10.htm">Zephaniah 1:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine sorrow is fitting when sin has invited divine discipline (<a href="/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13&#8211;14</a>).

The wailing residents represent anyone who trusts in economic strength rather than the Lord. The passage reminds us that God demands righteousness in business as surely as in worship, and that no amount of wealth can stand when He confronts sin. Genuine repentance and wholehearted reliance on Him remain the only safe investment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span>p - <span class="cmt_word">Maktesh;</span> <span class="accented">the Mortar</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "her that is broken down."

It does not seem a very appropriate appellation for a lengthy valley like the Tyropceum, nor is there any trace of such a name being applied to it elsewhere.
