The act of "coming" suggests an ongoing, active pursuit of faith and communion with Christ. It echoes the call of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." This approach is not a one-time event but a continual drawing near to Christ, emphasizing the relational aspect of Christianity.<p><b>the living stone</b><br>The term "living stone" is a metaphor for Jesus Christ, highlighting His resurrection and eternal life. Unlike inanimate stones used in construction, Jesus is alive and active. This imagery connects to Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, which speaks of a "tested stone, a precious cornerstone" laid by God. The living stone signifies strength, stability, and the foundation of the church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, where Christ is described as the cornerstone.<p><b>rejected by men</b><br>This phrase reflects the historical reality of Jesus' rejection by the Jewish leaders and many of His contemporaries, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, "He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him." It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the Messiah as "despised and rejected by mankind." This rejection is a recurring theme in the Gospels, culminating in the crucifixion.<p><b>but chosen and precious in God&#8217;s sight</b><br>Despite human rejection, Jesus is "chosen" by God, indicating divine election and purpose. This aligns with the Messianic prophecy in <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone." The term "precious" underscores the value and honor bestowed upon Christ by God, contrasting human judgment with divine approval. This divine perspective is crucial for understanding the true identity and mission of Jesus, as affirmed in <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, where God declares Jesus as His beloved Son.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as the "living stone," symbolizing His role as the foundation of the Church and His eternal, life-giving nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who authored this epistle, addressing early Christians facing persecution and encouraging them in their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christians.htm">Early Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, who were experiencing trials and needed reassurance of their identity and purpose in Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one who has chosen and deemed Jesus as precious, highlighting the divine approval and purpose in Christ's mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/men.htm">Men</a></b><br>Those who rejected Jesus, representing the world&#8217;s opposition to God&#8217;s chosen plan and the contrast between human and divine perspectives.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_living_stone.htm">The Living Stone</a></b><br>Jesus is not just a historical figure but a living presence, actively involved in the life of believers.

(Comp. Note on <a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm" title="As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:">1Peter 2:2</a>.) It is also strangely used in something of the same sense in <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm" title="If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;">1Timothy 6:3</a>. "Joining Him therefore as proselytes." Not that St. Peter has any notion of a mere external accession. The Apostolic writers do not contemplate the possibility of a difference between the visible and invisible Church. From this point the regeneration-idea, which coloured the whole of the preceding portion of the Epistle, suddenly disappears. The thought is no longer that of a spiritual seed instead of a carnal seed, but of a spiritual Temple instead of the stone temple at Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">A living stone.</span>--The very structure and order of the sentence puts Jesus Christ first. Foundation first, building afterwards. It is a pity to insert "as unto" with our version; it takes off from the striking, attracting effect of the sudden metaphor. St. Peter is fond of explaining his metaphors--<span class= "ital">e.g., "</span>inheritance . . . in heaven," "tested genuineness . . . more precious than of gold," "gird up . . . loins of your minds:" so here, "living stone." It is more than doubtful whether St. Peter, in what follows, had before his mind the giving of his own surname. The word which he here uses is neither <span class= "ital">petros, </span>nor <span class= "ital">petra, </span>but <span class= "ital">lithos;</span> and indeed the whole idea of the relative position of the Church to the <span class= "ital">petra</span> and to the <span class= "ital">lithos</span> is quite different. Neither <span class= "ital">petros</span> nor <span class= "ital">petra</span> could possibly be used of the squared wrought stone, but represent the native rocky unhewn substratum--part, or whole--which pre-exists before any building is begun, even before the "chief corner-stone" would be placed. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm" title="Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:">Matthew 7:24</a>.) Here, therefore, the idea is quite different: the substratum is not thought of at all; and Jesus Christ is a carefully selected and hewn stone (<span class= "ital">lithos</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>specially laid as the first act in the work of building. The only thing, therefore, which is, in fact, common to the two passages is the simple thought of the Christian Church being like a building. Our present verse gives us no direct help towards finding how St. Peter understood the famous name-passage. All we can say for certain is that he did not so interpret it as to suppose an official connection with his own person to be the one essential of the true Church, or else in again using the metaphor of building the Church (though in a different connection) he could hardly have omitted all mention of himself. He is, apparently, thinking only of the Messianic interpretation of Old Testament sayings as expounded by our Lord--the "unsophisticated milk of the word" of <a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm" title="As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:">1Peter 2:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Disallowed indeed of men.</span>--A direct reference to the passage (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm" title="The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.">Psalm 118:22</a>), which is quoted below in <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm" title="To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,">1Peter 2:7</a>. It here says "men," rather than "builders," in order to contrast them more forcibly with God. The word "disallowed," or "rejected," implies a form of trial or probation which comes to an unsatisfactory conclusion. The human builders examine the stone, inspect all its qualifications, and find it unsuited to the edifice which <span class= "ital">they</span> have in hand, and refuse it not only the place of honour, but any place at all, in their architecture. St. Peter wishes to bring out strongly the absolute opposition between God and the Jews. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To whom coming as unto a living stone.</span> Omit the words, "as unto," which are not in the Greek, and weaken the sense. The participle is present; the Christian must be ever coming to Christ, riot only once for all, but always, every day. The ', living Stone" is Christ; the "Lord" of <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a> is Jehovah. St. Peter passes from the figure of milk to that of a chief cornerstone. So St. Paul, in <a href="/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3</a>, after saying that he had fed his Corinthian converts "with milk, and not with meat," passes first to the figure of laborers on the land, and then to that of builders upon the one foundation "which is Jesus Christ." This, like so many other coincidences, indicates St. Peter's knowledge of St. Paul's Epistles. St. Peter may have been thinking of his own name, the name which Christ gave him when Andrew brought him to the Lord; though the Greek word here is not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;</span> the solid native rock on which the temple is built, nor a piece of rock, an unhewn stone, but a stone shaped and wrought, chosen for a chief corner-stone. But the apostle does not mention himself; he omits all reference to his own position in the spiritual building; he wishes to direct his readers only to Christ. He is plainly referring to the Lord's own words in <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, where Christ applies to himself the language of <a href="/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, He described himself as a Stone; St. Peter adds the epithet "<span class="accented">living"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). The figure of a stone is inadequate, all figures are inadequate, to represent heavenly mysteries. This stone is not, like the stones of earth, an inert mass; it is living, full of life; nay, it gives life, as well as strength and coherence, to the stones which are built upon it: for the Lord hath life in himself - he is risen from the dead, and is alive for evermore. <span class="cmt_word">Disallowed indeed of men.</span> St. Peter slightly varies the quotation, and attributes to men in general the rejection ascribed in the psalm and in the Gospel to the "<span class="accented">builders</span>." "<span class="accented">He</span> was despised and rejected of men." In his speech before the Sanhedrin (<a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>), he had directly applied the prophecy to the chief priests.
