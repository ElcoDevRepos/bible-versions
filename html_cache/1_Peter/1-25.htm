The concept of the enduring word is rooted in <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>, which states, "The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever." This connection to Isaiah highlights the fulfillment of prophecy and the reliability of God's promises. The phrase underscores the belief that God's word is unchanging and authoritative, providing a foundation for faith and practice. In the New Testament context, this eternal word is often associated with the teachings of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. The enduring nature of God's word assures believers of the permanence and reliability of the gospel message.<p><b>And this is the word that was proclaimed to you.</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the gospel message that was preached to the recipients of Peter's letter. The early Christian community, to whom Peter was writing, was composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers scattered throughout Asia Minor. The proclamation of the word refers to the apostolic preaching of the good news of Jesus Christ, His death, and resurrection, which was central to the early church's mission. This proclamation is seen as a fulfillment of the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations. The phrase also emphasizes the personal nature of the gospel message, as it was specifically delivered to the audience of Peter's letter, affirming their inclusion in God's redemptive plan. The use of "proclaimed" highlights the oral tradition of spreading the gospel, which was vital in a time when written texts were not as accessible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle of Jesus Christ who authored this epistle.

Here St. Peter recognizes the gospel which had been preached in Asia Minor as the Word of the Lord which abideth for ever. St. Paul and his companions were the missionaries from whom those provinces had heard the Word of God.
