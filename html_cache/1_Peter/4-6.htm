The context of 1 Peter indicates that these individuals were likely believers who had heard the gospel during their lifetime but had since died. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that the gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). The preaching to the "dead" may also reflect the early Christian understanding of Christ's proclamation to the spirits in prison (<a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>), emphasizing the reach and power of the gospel beyond physical life. This phrase underscores the hope of resurrection and eternal life, a central tenet of Christian faith, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<p><b>so that they might be judged as men in the flesh</b><br>This part of the verse acknowledges the reality of human judgment and suffering in the physical realm. Believers, like all people, face judgment and trials in their earthly lives. This judgment can refer to the trials and persecutions faced by early Christians, as Peter's audience was experiencing. The phrase reflects the biblical theme of enduring suffering for righteousness' sake, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/3-14.htm">1 Peter 3:14-17</a>. It also echoes the teaching of Jesus, who warned His followers of persecution (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>). The judgment "in the flesh" contrasts with the ultimate spiritual reality that believers are called to live by.<p><b>but live according to God in the spirit</b><br>This phrase highlights the transformative power of the gospel, which enables believers to live a new life in accordance with God's will. Living "according to God in the spirit" signifies a life led by the Holy Spirit, characterized by righteousness, peace, and joy (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>). It points to the spiritual rebirth and renewal that comes through faith in Christ, as described in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a> and <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>. This spiritual life is not bound by physical death but is eternal, aligning with the promise of eternal life through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).

The Greek is simply, <span class= "ital">For for this end was the gospel preached to the dead also, </span>or, still more literally, <span class= "ital">to dead men also.</span> No one with an un-preoccupied mind could doubt, taking this clause by itself, that the persons to whom this preaching was made were dead at the time of being preached to. If this is the case, then, pretty obviously, St. Peter is carrying us back to his teaching of <a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>, and is explaining further the purpose of Christ's descent into hell.<p><span class= "bld">That they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</span>--In order to obtain a clear notion of this hard saying, it will be necessary once more to survey the course of the whole passage. "It is better," the Apostle said, "to suffer in well-doing than in evil-doing." They must take their choice, that is, which kind of suffering they would have. It was not indeed certain that in case they chose to do <span class= "ital">well</span> they would suffer for it; and if they <span class= "ital">did, </span>there was the history of Christ to encourage them. But in case they chose to be evil-doers, it was certain that they would suffer. "And you had better," he says, "suffer in well-doing than in evil-doing." He then gives an instance of persons who suffered in evil-doing--the fleshly Antediluvians, whom God cut short in their crimes by the Flood, and to whom Christ went to preach in their prison-house. He then exhorts his readers--some of whom had, for one reason or another, been allowing themselves to fall into antinomian ways--not to live any longer to the flesh, not to make true the slanders of the heathen, who tried to make out that the Christians were as bad livers as themselves; for such evil-doers were doomed to speedy suffering; those heathens would soon be called to account by Him who was ready to judge quick and dead alike; "for," he adds, "the object of that preaching to the dead also was that they may be judged according to men in flesh, but may live according to God in spirit." (1) The first question is, What does the Apostle mean to substantiate by this last verse, "<span class= "ital">for</span> for this cause?" Not the fact that Christ will judge the dead as well as the quick, for that would have no practical bearing upon the readers. Not the fact that Christ was now <span class= "ital">ready</span> for judgment; for although He will certainly not come until the dead as well as the quick are in a position to be judged, yet we should then have expected something more like, "The reason why the dead were preached to was that the judgment might no longer be put off;" instead of which, the whole point, of the verse is the particular destiny in reserve for those dead, which destiny was the intention and result of Christ's preaching the gospel to them. It must, therefore, be a further reason for warning the Christians not to live lives of evil-doing like the contemporaries of Noah or their own heathen contemporaries. If it be necessary to attach the word "for" to any particular words, we may perhaps attach it to the words "they shall give account;" and <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a> would hint at the kind of account they would have to give, as "giving account" implies the settlement which follows. (2) But if <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a> clenches the warning to the Christians not to become antinomian, then we must understand the destiny of these dead to whom Christ preached to be not the brightest, after all. This brings us to consider what is meant by their being "judged in flesh" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as in <a href="/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1Peter 4:1</a>, so far as flesh is concerned). In the previous verse, Christ is said to be quite ready to "judge" quick and dead. The context makes us feel that St. Peter is not picturing to himself that scene as one of calm forensic investigation, with "opened books" or the like. His idea of this judgment is rather of a "judgment" such as took place in the days of Noe, a great <span class= "ital">crisis</span> (the Greek word for "judgment") or world-wide catastrophe, which, of course, cannot harm the just, but only the unjust. He shows the same conception of the Judgment, and illustrates it by Noe's Flood, in <a href="/context/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2Peter 2:5-9</a>; <a href="/context/2_peter/3-6.htm" title="Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:">2Peter 3:6-7</a>. Now "judgment" is a neutral word, which, in Scripture, takes its colour from the surroundings, so that it sometimes is a thing to be longed for (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/psalms/43-1.htm" title="Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.">Psalm 43:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-2.htm" title="He shall judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with judgment.">Psalm 72:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.">Hebrews 10:30</a>); at other times a thing to be dreaded, as here. Though we do not limit the "quick and dead" here to mean the <span class= "ital">wicked</span> quick, and dead, yet they are evidently uppermost in St. Peter's mind, so that there is scarcely any conscious change in the meaning of the word "judged" when we pass from <a href="/1_peter/4-5.htm" title="Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.">1Peter 4:5</a> to <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a>. It there means certainly a judicial punishment, or even judicial destruction. While the word often denotes a condemnation (as in English we say "to sentence")--for example, in <a href="/context/john/16-1.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that you should not be offended.">John 16:1-2</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.">2Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-2.htm" title="For true and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.">Revelation 19:2</a>--it seems to have the further notion of a judicial <span class= "ital">death</span> in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.">1Corinthians 11:31-32</a> : "Had we been in the habit of discerning ourselves, we should not have been subject to these repeated judgments (weakness, sickness, death--<a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.">1Corinthians 11:30</a>); but now these judgments are a discipline from our Lord, to save us from being condemned with the world." And that judicial <span class= "ital">destruction</span> to the flesh is what St. Peter means. he proves by contrasting "but may <span class= "ital">live</span> in spirit" rather than "be saved" or "justified." (3) It is next to be considered what date we are to fix for this judgment of the flesh. Was it previous to Christ's preaching the gospel to them in hell, or was it to be subsequent? Taking the former line, we should be able to paraphrase, "His object was, that though in flesh they had been judged, having been judicially destroyed by the Flood, they yet might live hereafter in spirit." But, besides other difficulties, it is far more than doubtful whether it is Greek to infuse a <span class= "ital">past</span> sense into the subjunctive mood here used: <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to render this, "it was preached in order that they <span class= "ital">might have been</span> judged." Had we the words by themselves, and no preconceived theology to hinder us, we should undoubtedly translate, "To this end was the gospel preached to dead men too: viz., in order that they <span class= "ital">may be</span> judged indeed according to men so far as they are flesh, but may live according to God so far as they are spirit." The judgment spoken of would not be their death beneath the waves of Noe, but something still future; and this view would be confirmed by reading what St. Peter says of them, and of the angels who (in all probability) sinned with them, in the passages of the Second Epistle above referred to. How, then, will they be hereafter condemned to a judicial destruction of the flesh, but a merciful preservation of the spirit? The answer, though it seems inevitable to the present writer, must be given with trembling, and in deference to the judgment of the Church, the collective Christian consciousness, whenever that shall be expressed upon the point. A close parallel may be found in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>. There St. Paul judges to deliver to Satan (is he the warder of the "prison" where such spirits are confined?) a person who has foully sinned in the flesh, "for annihilation of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." That in that place it does not mean a temporal judgment upon the bodily life (such as was passed upon the Antediluvians or the profaners of the Eucharist at Corinth) is clear, from the fact that excommunication was <span class= "ital">not</span> attended with temporal death. That it does not mean voluntary self-mortification of the flesh in this world seems clear (among other considerations) by comparison of our present passage, for the opportunity for self-mortification in the flesh was long past for the spirits to whom Christ preached. Now why, in these two cases, do the writers take pains to point the antithesis between "flesh" and "spirit," if, after all, the flesh is to share the mercy shown to the spirit? The antithesis becomes a false one. Why did not St. Paul say, "To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that he may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus?" and St. Peter, "For this cause was the gospel preached to the dead also, that though judged indeed in flesh, they might, after all, live according to God?" And what is the point of this dread warning, if in the end these Antediluvians attain to the same bliss, "both in body and soul," as other men? There is a whole set of passages which seems to teach that resurrection--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the permanent restitution of life to the body--is a gift which does not belong to all. To those who eat Christ's flesh. He promises, "I will raise him up at the last day" (<a href="/john/6-54.htm" title="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>). St. Paul suffers the loss of all things, "if by any means he may attain to the resurrection of the dead" (<a href="/philippians/3-11.htm" title="If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.">Philippians 3:11</a>; comp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2Corinthians 5:3-4</a>). Our Lord bids the Apostles "fear Him [it is doubtful whether he means God, or Satan, who acts by God's permission] who is able to destroy both soul [He does not say 'spirit'] and body in hell." So it would be the simplest explanation of our present text if we might believe that these Antediluvians were to be deprived of resurrection of the flesh which they had so foully corrupted, but in God's mercy, through accepting the gospel preached to them by Christ after their death, were to be allowed a purely spiritual existence. They would thus be sentenced "according to men," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from a human point of view: they would be unable to take their place again among the glorified human species in a human life; but still they would be alive "according to God," from God's point of view--a divine life, but "in the spirit" only. It was a gospel that Christ preached to them, for without it they would not have come to "live according to God" at all. Yet, on the other hand, it was a warning to the Christians. When it says "the gospel was preached to the dead <span class= "ital">also,</span>" it implies a similar preaching to others, viz., to the heathen who were to "give account," and that the result of the preaching would be the same. Those heathen who through ignorance lived corrupt lives all around, might possibly, in the intermediate state, hope to receive a gospel which would enable a bare half of their humanity to live according to God hereafter. It could not avert the destruction of their flesh. What, then, could be the hope of a Christian, one who had heard and embraced the gospel in this life, and had then surrendered himself to the same corruptions as the Gentiles? . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead.</span> The conjunction "for" seems to link this verse closely to ver. 5, while the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> ("also" or "even") gives an emphasis to" them that are dead" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). We naturally refer these last words to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> of the preceding verse. The apostle seems to be meeting an objection. The Thessalonian Christians feared lest believers who fell asleep before the second advent should lose something of the blessedness of those who should be alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord. On the other hand, some of St. Peter's readers may, perhaps, have thought that those who had passed away before the gospel times could not be justly judged in the same way as those who then were living. The two classes, the living and the dead, were separated by a great difference: the living had heard the gospel, the dead had not; the living had opportunities and privileges which had not been granted to the dead. But, St. Peter says, the gospel was preached also to the dead; they too heard the glad tidings of salvation (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Some have thought that the word "<span class="accented">dead"</span> is used metaphorically for the dead in trespasses and sins. But it seems scarcely possible to give the word a literal sense in ver. 5 and a metaphorical sense in ver. 6. Some understand the apostle as meaning that the gospel had been preached to those who then were dead, before their death; but it seems unnatural to assign different times to the verb and the substantive. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> directs our thoughts to some definite occasion. The absence of the article (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) should also be noticed; the words assert that the gospel was preached to dead persons - to some that were (lead. These considerations lead us to connect the passage with <a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19, 20</a>. There St. Peter tells us that Christ himself went and preached in the spirit "to the spirits in prison;" then the gospel was preached, the good news of salvation was announced, to some that were dead. The article is absent both here and in ver. 5 (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>). All men, quick and dead alike, must appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; so St. Peter may not have intended to limit the area of the Lord's preaching in Hades here, as he had done in <a href="/1_peter/3.htm">1 Peter 3</a>. There he mentioned one section only of the departed; partly because the Deluge furnished a conspicuous example of men who suffered for evil-doing, partly because he regarded it as a striking type of Christian baptism. Here, perhaps, he asserts the general fact - the gospel was preached to the dead; perhaps (we may not presume to dogmatize in a matter so mysterious, about which so little is revealed) to all the vast population of the underworld, who had passed away before the gospel times. Like the men of Tyre and Sidon, of Sodom and Gomorrah, they had not seen the works or heard the words of Christ during their life on the earth; now they heard from the Lord himself what he had done for the salvation of mankind. Therefore God was ready to judge the quick and the dead, for to both was the gospel preached. <span class="cmt_word">That they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</span> The gospel was preached to the dead for this end (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), that they might be judged indeed (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>), but nevertheless live (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). The last clause expresses the end and purpose of the preaching; the former clause, though grammatically dependent upon the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, states a necessity antecedent to the preaching (comp. <a href="/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17</a>, "God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart;" and Romans 8:10, "If Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness." The meaning seems to be - the gospel was preached to the dead, that, though they were judged, yet they might live. They had suffered the judgment of death, the punishment of human sin. Christ had been put to death in the flesh (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>) for the sins of others; the dead had suffered death in the flesh for their own sins. They had died before the manifestation of the Son of God, before the great work of atonement wrought by his death; but that atonement was retrospective - he "taketh away the sin of the <span class="accented">world</span>;" its saving influences extended even to the realm of the dead. The gospel was preached to the dead, that, though they were judged according to men (that is, after the fashion of men, as all men are judged), yet they might live in the spirit (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>, "To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus"). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, "might he judged," is aorist, as describing a single fact; the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, "might live," is present, as describing a continual state. <span class="accented">According to God.</span> God is Spirit; and as they that worship him must worship in spirit, so they who believe in him shall live in spirit. The future life is a spiritual life; the resurrection-bodies of the saints will be spiritual bodies, for" flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God." But <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> may also mean "according to the will of God" (as in <a href="/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>), according to his gracious purpose, and in that life which he giveth to his chosen, that eternal life which lieth in the knowledge of God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">That is why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the gospel was preached</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#951;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(eu&#275;ngelisth&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2097.htm">Strong's 2097: </a> </span><span class="str2">From eu and aggelos; to announce good news especially the gospel.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to [those who are now] dead,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(nekrois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Dative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3498.htm">Strong's 3498: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) adj: dead, lifeless, subject to death, mortal, (b) noun: a dead body, a corpse.
