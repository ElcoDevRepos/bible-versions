The sinlessness of Jesus is crucial because it qualifies Him as the perfect sacrifice for humanity's sins, fulfilling the requirements of the Old Testament sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). In the context of 1 Peter, this statement underscores Jesus as the ultimate example of righteous suffering, encouraging believers to endure persecution without sinning. The sinlessness of Christ is also prophesied in the Old Testament, notably in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who "had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth."<p><b>and no deceit was found in His mouth</b><br>This phrase highlights the truthfulness and integrity of Jesus. In a cultural context where honor and shame were significant, being without deceit was a mark of true righteousness and honor. Jesus' life and teachings consistently reflected truth, aligning with His declaration in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." This aspect of Jesus' character fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, reinforcing His role as the suffering servant who embodies truth and righteousness. The absence of deceit in Jesus' words and actions serves as a model for believers, who are called to speak truthfully and live with integrity, even in the face of suffering or persecution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, Jesus is depicted as sinless and without deceit, emphasizing His perfect nature and role as the spotless Lamb of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who authored this epistle, writing to encourage and instruct believers in Asia Minor facing persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/asia_minor.htm">Asia Minor</a></b><br>The region where the recipients of Peter's letter resided, consisting of various early Christian communities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_church.htm">Early Christian Church</a></b><br>The broader context of the letter, addressing the challenges and persecutions faced by early Christians.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_testament_prophets.htm">Old Testament Prophets</a></b><br>The verse echoes the prophecies about the Messiah, particularly those found in Isaiah, which foretold a suffering servant who would be without sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sinless_nature_of_christ.htm">The Sinless Nature of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' sinlessness is foundational to His role as the perfect sacrifice for our sins.

It is not the sinlessness of Christ by itself that is here set as an example before the servants, but His sinlessness in combination with His ill-treatment, or rather, His meekness under the combination. St. Peter again adapts the words of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm" title="And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.">Isaiah 53:9</a>) to his purpose. The word there was one of violent transgression; St. Peter substitutes the simple word which he had used in <a href="/1_peter/2-20.htm" title="For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.">1Peter 2:20</a>, "fault"--"who never made a fault"--such as household servants were often committing--"neither was guile found in His mouth"--again referring to what was common with servants--petty acts of dishonesty, and petty deceits to screen themselves from punishment. One thing which lends special point to the allusion to Isaiah's prophecy is that Israel is in that passage spoken of under the title of God's "servant," a thought familiar to St. Peter long ago in connection with Christ. (See Note on <a href="/acts/3-13.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.">Acts 3:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</span> St. Peter is quoting the Septuagint Version of <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, almost exactly, the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, sin, being substituted for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, lawlessness ("violence" in our version). We should notice that the Messiah, whose example is here set before Christian slaves, is called by the prophet "the Servant of Jehovah" (Isaiah lit. 13). Slaves were often tempted to deceit and guile; they must look to the Lord Jesus, and strive to copy his innocence and his truth. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be found, is sometimes said to be used, by a Hebraism, for the simple verb "to be." Winer says, "Between these two verbs, however, there is always this distinction, that, whilst <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, indicates the quality of a thing in itself, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> indicates the quality in so far as it is discovered, detected, recognized, in the subject" ('Greek Grammar,' 65:8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8011;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">committed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epoi&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
