It indicates that Jesus was not a plan B or an afterthought in God's redemptive plan. The concept of being "known" suggests an intimate and purposeful relationship within the Trinity. This aligns with <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, which states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." The idea of being known before the world's foundation also connects to <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, where believers are chosen in Christ before the creation of the world, highlighting God's sovereign plan and foreknowledge.<p><b>but was revealed in the last times</b><br>The revelation of Christ in the "last times" refers to His incarnation, life, death, and resurrection. This period is often understood as the culmination of God's redemptive history, marking the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a> speaks of God speaking through His Son in these last days, indicating a new and final phase of divine revelation. The term "last times" reflects the eschatological perspective of the New Testament, where the coming of Christ initiates the end times, a period characterized by the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>for your sake</b><br>This phrase underscores the personal and communal aspect of Christ's mission. It highlights the sacrificial nature of Jesus' work, emphasizing that His revelation and redemptive acts were done for the benefit of believers. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's love and salvation plan for humanity, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son." The personal pronoun "your" makes the message intimate and direct, reminding believers of the personal impact of Christ's work and the grace extended to them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, whose pre-existence and revelation are highlighted.

"Who <span class= "ital">had been foreknown, </span>indeed, before the foundation of the world, but for your benefit <span class= "ital">was </span>(<span class= "ital">only</span>)<span class= "ital"> pointed out</span> at the end of the times." St, Peter is returning once more to the great argument of <a href="/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10-12</a>, "Do not treat your share in the gospel liberation as if it were, at best, a piece of good luck, and so learn to despise it. Neither think of it as if Paul and Silvanus were preaching to you a novel invention at discord with the spirit of the old covenant, under which you were bred. God knew from all eternity who was to be His Messiah and His Lamb, but for your sakes the particular and personal declaration of Him was reserved till now. For you has been kept the revelation of a secret which underlay the whole Old Testament system." The grammatical antecedent of the relative "who verily" is not "lamb," but "Christ;" and the word for "foreordained" is, literally, <span class= "ital">foreknown, </span>only as in <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1Peter 1:2</a> (see Note), with the additional notion of coming to a decision. We see that St. Peter's doctrine has not changed since the great day of Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>). The foreknowledge (as that passage would show) includes not only the knowledge and decision that Jesus should be the Christ, but that the Christ's history should be what it was; and this seems to involve not only the doctrine that the Incarnation was no mere episode, consequent upon the Fall of man, but also the doctrine that, "before the foundation of the world," God had foreknown, and predecided to allow, the Fall itself. The same doctrine seems to be involved in <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a>, but only indirectly, because there the words "from the foundation of the world," are to be attached, not to the word "slain," but to the word "written."<p><span class= "bld">Was manifest.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">was manifested, i.e., </span>unambiguously shown, pointed out. The context shows that it does not simply mean the visible life of the Incarnate Word among men, as in <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm" title="And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.">1John 3:5</a>; but that the Messiah and Lamb of God was pointed out as being identical with the Man Jesus. And this was the work of John the Baptist, to say of the particular Person whom he saw walking by Jordan, <span class= "ital">"Behold</span> the Lamb." So St. John Baptist himself described his mission: "The whole purpose of my coming was that He might be <span class= "ital">manifested, </span>singled out and shown to Israel," as the Person round whom all their Messianic hopes were gathered (<a href="/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">who was foreknown indeed</span>; literally, <span class="accented">who hath been fore known</span>. But the foreknowledge of God implies the exercise of his will, therefore the "foreordained" of the Authorized Version, though not here an exact translation, is true in doctrine. St. Peter had asserted the same great truth in his sermon on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; comp. also Acts 3:18 and Acts 4:28). He had heard the words, "before the foundation of the world," again and again from the lips of Christ; he may possibly have read them in the Epistle to the Ephesians (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). The incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ were not the result of a change of purpose to meet unforeseen circumstances; they were foreseen and foreordained in the eternal counsels of God. Those counsels are wholly above the range of our understanding; we cannot see through the veil of mystery which surrounds them; we cannot fathom the awful necessities which they imply. But was manifest in these last times for you; rather, as in the Revised Version, with the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">was manifested at the end of the times for your sake</span>. The aorist (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) marks the Incarnation as an event which took place in time; the purpose of God was eternal, before all time. For the phrase, "at the end of the times" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), compare the reading of the most ancient manuscripts in <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "at the end of these days"); also in <a href="/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>).
