The use of "therefore" indicates a conclusion drawn from previous teachings, specifically the redemptive suffering of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>). The physical suffering of Jesus is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. This suffering was not only physical but also spiritual, as He bore the sins of humanity. The geographical context of Christ's suffering includes locations like Gethsemane and Golgotha, which are significant in the narrative of His passion.<p><b>arm yourselves with the same resolve</b><br>The metaphor of arming oneself suggests preparation for battle, indicating that believers are to adopt a mindset of readiness and determination. This resolve is akin to the mindset of Christ, who willingly endured suffering for a greater purpose. The call to "arm yourselves" implies a proactive stance in the face of trials, echoing <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-17</a>, where believers are instructed to put on the full armor of God. The cultural context of the early church involved persecution, making this exhortation particularly relevant as believers faced hostility for their faith.<p><b>because anyone who has suffered in his body is done with sin</b><br>This phrase suggests a transformative aspect of suffering, where enduring physical trials can lead to a break from sin. The idea is not that suffering itself purifies, but that it can lead to a deeper reliance on God and a rejection of sinful behaviors. This concept is linked to <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6-7</a>, where Paul speaks of being crucified with Christ and no longer being slaves to sin. Historically, early Christians often faced persecution, and their willingness to suffer for their faith was seen as evidence of their commitment to Christ and a life free from sin. Theologically, this reflects the sanctification process, where believers grow in holiness through trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

The reference is to the words "killed in (or, <span class= "ital">to</span>) the flesh" in <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>, to which the word "then" takes us back. It is difficult to decide about the right of the words "for us" to stand in the text. Tischendorf and Lachmann strike them out, and they are probably right in doing so. The authority for the reading "for you" is nearly as strong; but in fact neither is wanted here, as the point is not the atoning character of Christ's death, but the death itself.<p><span class= "bld">Arm yourselves likewise with the same mind.</span>--Or rather, w<span class= "ital">ith the same conception.</span> It does not mean merely "put yourselves into the same disposition:" that is, "resolve to die with Him." Though the word which is here rendered "mind" may possibly bear the meaning "intent" assigned to it in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a> (the only other place in the New Testament where it occurs), the more natural and common sense is that of <span class= "ital">conception, notion, view.</span> Christ is therefore said to have been "armed" with a particular "conception" or "view," which He found to be sufficient shield in the day of suffering; and we are exhorted to try the same defensive armour. The "view" which Christ found so efficacious was the view He took of the "suffering" itself. What that view was is forthwith explained.<p><span class= "bld">For he that hath suffered in the flesh . . .</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">that he that hath suffered to the flesh is at rest from, sin.</span> This is the "view" which we are to take. The thought is probably derived from <a href="/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin.">Romans 6:7</a>. The death of the body puts a stop (at any rate, for the redeemed) to any further possibility of sin. Welcome, death! A slight difficulty is caused by the implied fact that Christ, too, in dying "ceased from sin." But the Greek word for "hath ceased" literally means <span class= "ital">hath been caused to rest, </span>St. Peter using expressly (for the only time in the New Testament) that part of the verb which does not mean a voluntary cessation from what one was doing before, but a pause imposed from without. And that Christ looked upon His death as a boon of rest from sin (it does not say from <span class= "ital">sinning</span>) is not only a true and impressive thought, but is fully justified by <a href="/romans/6-10.htm" title="For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.">Romans 6:10</a>, "He died unto sin," and even by His cry, "It is finished." Whatever harshness there is in the thought is much softened by the fact that St. Peter names it as the view <span class= "ital">we</span> are to take, not <span class= "ital">directly</span> as the view <span class= "ital">He</span> took; so that it admits of some adjustment when applied to <span class= "ital">Him.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh.</span> St. Peter returns, after the digression of <a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19-22</a>, to the great subject of Christ's example. The words "for us" are omitted in some ancient manuscripts; they express a great truth already dwelt upon in <a href="/1_peter/2.htm">1 Peter 2</a>. and 3. Here the apostle is insisting upon the example of Christ, not on the atoning efficacy of his death. Arm yourselves likewise with the same mind. The word rendered "mind" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is more exactly "thought" (comp. <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, the only other place where it occurs in the New Testament); but it certainly has sometimes the force of "intention, resolve." The Christian must be like his Mustier; he must arm himself with the great thought, the holy resolve, which was in the mind of Christ - the thought that suffering borne in faith frees us from the power of sin, the resolve to suffer patiently according to the will of God. That thought, which can be made our own only by faith, is the Christian's shield; we are to arm ourselves with it against the assaults of the evil one (comp. <a href="/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin.</span> The thought is that of <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6-11</a>. Some translate the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "that," and understand it as giving the content of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: "Arm yourselves with the thought that," etc.; but this does not give so good a sense, and would seem to require <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x28;</span> " this thought," rather than "the same thought." Some, again, understand this clause of Christ; but this seems a mistake. The apostle spoke first of the Master; now he turns to the disciple. Take, he says, for your amour the thoughts which filled the sacred heart of Christ - the thought that suffering in the flesh is not, as the world counts it, an unmixed evil, but often a deep blessing; for, or because, he that suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin. If, when we are called to suffer, we offer up our sufferings to Christ who suffered for us, and unite our sufferings with his by faith in him, then those sufferings, thus sanctified, destroy the power of sin, and make us cease from sin (comp. <a href="/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore, since</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
