The call to "submit" reflects a broader biblical principle of order and respect within societal structures, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a> and <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-24</a>. Submission here is not about inferiority but about maintaining harmony and witness within the household. The phrase "with all respect" emphasizes the attitude of the heart, aligning with the Christian call to honor all people (<a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>).<p><b>not only to those who are good and gentle</b><br>This acknowledges that some masters were kind and fair, providing a more positive environment for servants. The call to submit to such masters aligns with the natural human inclination to respond positively to kindness. This mirrors the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/5-46.htm">Matthew 5:46-47</a>, where loving those who love you is seen as a basic expectation. The mention of "good and gentle" masters highlights the ideal relationship between authority and subordinates, reflecting God's character of kindness and gentleness (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p><b>but even to those who are unreasonable</b><br>The term "unreasonable" can also be translated as "harsh" or "perverse," indicating masters who are unjust or difficult. This instruction challenges believers to exhibit Christ-like behavior even in unjust circumstances, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39-41</a> about turning the other cheek and going the extra mile. This reflects the suffering servant motif found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the Messiah endures unjust treatment. By submitting to harsh masters, servants bear witness to the transformative power of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21-23</a>, where Christ's own suffering is presented as an example to follow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

St. Peter may have used it as a less harsh term, in Christian kindliness and courtesy; or he may have chosen it purposely to include the large class of freedmen and other dependents who were to be found in the houses of the great. The frequent mention of slaves in the Epistles shows that many of the first Christians must have been in a condition of servitude (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21-23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>, etc.). It was only natural that men should feel uneasy and irritable under the yoke of slavery as they came to learn the equality of all men in the sight of God, and to understand the blessed privileges and the high hopes of Christians. The apostles counseled submission and resignation to the will of God. Slavery was an unnatural institution; it must in time disappear under the softening influences of the gospel. But Christian slaves were to wait in faith and patience. The sacred writers use language of studied moderation, carefully avoiding any expressions which might be regarded as exciting to violence or revolutionary outbreaks. <span class="cmt_word">Be subject to your</span> <span class="cmt_word">masters with all fear</span>.
