The "Gentiles" here refers to non-Jews, often seen as living outside the covenant with God and engaging in practices contrary to His will. The early Christian audience, many of whom were Gentile converts, is reminded of their past life before knowing Christ. This echoes <a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17-19</a>, where Paul urges believers to no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. The call to leave behind former ways is a common theme in the New Testament, emphasizing repentance and the new life in Christ.<p><b>living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and detestable idolatry.</b><br>This list of behaviors represents a lifestyle contrary to Christian values. "Debauchery" and "lust" refer to excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures, often condemned in Scripture (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>). "Drunkenness" and "orgies" highlight the lack of self-control and moral restraint, which were prevalent in many Greco-Roman social and religious practices. "Carousing" suggests wild, noisy festivities, often associated with pagan worship. "Detestable idolatry" underscores the worship of false gods, a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). These behaviors are contrasted with the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>), illustrating the radical change expected in a believer's life. The call to abandon such practices is rooted in the holiness God requires of His people, as seen throughout the Old and New Testaments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

They are "of our life," and "us." The first is added by some scribe to point the contrast with "the rest of his time." The second--which should be "you," if anything at all--is simply put to fill the gap after the word "suffice." If "our life" and "us" were right, we should have St. Peter, quite unlike his wont, identifying himself with the bad life here described, as though he himself had shared in it.<p><span class= "bld">May suffice.</span>--It is the same word as in <a href="/matthew/6-34.htm" title="Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.">Matthew 6:34</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-25.htm" title="It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?">Matthew 10:25</a>, and would be, literally, <span class= "ital">For sufficient is the past.</span> There is an irony in the word similar to that in <a href="/1_peter/3-17.htm" title="For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.">1Peter 3:17</a>, "it is better."<p><span class= "bld">To have wrought.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">to have perpetrated.</span> The Greek word denotes <span class= "ital">the</span> accomplishment of a <span class= "ital">criminal</span> purpose, as in <a href="/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1Corinthians 5:3</a>; and one passage more horrid still. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the time past may suffice.</span> The words, "of our life" and "us," are not found in the best manuscripts. St. Peter could not include himself among those who wrought the will of the Gentiles. The Greek word for "will" here is, according to the best manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; in ver. 2 "the will of God" is <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The general distinction is that <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> implies choice and purpose, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> merely inclination (compare, in the Greek, <a href="/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13, 14</a>). The change of word seems to point to such a distinction here. God's will is a fixed, holy purpose; the will, or rather wish, of the Gentiles was uncertain inclination, turned this way or that way by changeful lusts. The perfect infinitive, "to have wrought," implies that that part of life ought to be regarded as a thing wholly past and gone. The whole sentence has a tone of solemn irony. "Fastidium peccati apud resipiscentes" (Bengel); comp. <a href="/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a>. St. Peter is here addressing Gentile Christians. Fronm&uuml;ller's objection is peculiar: "Suppose that the readers of Peter's Epistle had formerly been heathens, his reproaching them with having formerly done the will of the Gentiles would surely be singular." They had done the will of the Gentiles; they were now, as Christians, to do the will of God. When we walked in lasciviousness, <span class="cmt_word">lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings,</span> and abominable idolatries; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and to have walked.</span> There is no pronoun. Lusts are the hidden sins of unclean thought, which lead to outbreaks of lasciviousness. The Greek word for "revellings" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is one often used of drunken youths parading the streets, or of festal processions in honor of Bacchus. The word translated "banquetings" means rather "drinking-bouts." The word for "abominable" is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, unlawful, nefarious, contrary to the eternal principles of the Divine Law; "quibus sanctissimum Dei jus violatur" (Bengel). St. Peter is probably referring, not only to the sin of idolatry in itself, but also to the many licentious practices connected with it. After the persecution of Nero, in which St. Peter perished, Christianity was regarded by the state as a <span class="accented">religio illicita.</span> Christianity was condemned by the law of Rome; idolatry is opposed to the eternal Law of God. This verse could not have been addressed to Hebrew Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
