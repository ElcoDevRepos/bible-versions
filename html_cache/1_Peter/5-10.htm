The early Christians faced persecution, and Peter's audience was no exception. The "little while" suggests that suffering is temporary compared to the eternal perspective. This echoes <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, where Paul speaks of "light and momentary troubles" achieving an eternal glory. The concept of suffering is also seen in the life of Jesus, who endured suffering before His glorification.<p><b>the God of all grace</b><br>This emphasizes God's nature as the source of all grace. Grace is unmerited favor, and it is through grace that believers are saved (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The phrase underscores God's sufficiency and generosity, providing believers with what they need to endure trials. It connects to the idea of God as a provider and sustainer, as seen throughout Scripture.<p><b>who has called you to His eternal glory in Christ</b><br>The calling here is a divine invitation to share in God's eternal glory, a theme prevalent in the New Testament. This calling is not based on human merit but on God's purpose and grace (<a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>). The phrase "in Christ" signifies that this glory is accessible only through a relationship with Jesus, who is the mediator of the new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<p><b>will Himself restore you</b><br>The promise of restoration is a reassurance to believers. The Greek word for "restore" can also mean to mend or perfect, suggesting a return to wholeness. This reflects God's active role in the believer's life, akin to the restoration seen in Job's life after his trials (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>).<p><b>secure you</b><br>This implies stability and support. The imagery is of God providing a firm foundation, much like the wise man who built his house on the rock (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>). It speaks to the security found in God's promises and His faithfulness to uphold His people.<p><b>strengthen you</b><br>Strengthening suggests an increase in spiritual fortitude. This is a common theme in Paul's letters, where he often prays for believers to be strengthened in their inner being (<a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>). It highlights the empowerment that comes from the Holy Spirit, enabling believers to endure and overcome challenges.<p><b>and establish you</b><br>To establish is to set firmly in place. This final promise assures believers of their firm standing in Christ. It is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>, where God sets the psalmist's feet upon a rock, making his steps secure. This establishment is both a present reality and a future hope, as believers are rooted in Christ and await the full realization of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who authored this epistle, addressing the early Christian communities facing persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_all_grace.htm">God of all grace</a></b><br>Refers to God as the source of all grace, emphasizing His benevolence and mercy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, through whom believers are called to eternal glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christians.htm">Early Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, enduring trials and suffering for their faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_glory.htm">Eternal Glory</a></b><br>The ultimate promise and hope for believers, signifying eternal life with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering.htm">Understanding Suffering</a></b><br>Recognize that suffering is temporary and serves a purpose in God's plan for our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_grace.htm">God's Grace</a></b><br>Embrace the sufficiency of God's grace, which empowers us to endure trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Keep an eternal perspective, focusing on the glory that awaits us in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_restoration.htm">Divine Restoration</a></b><br>Trust in God's promise to restore, secure, strengthen, and establish us after trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_faith.htm">Active Faith</a></b><br>Engage in active faith, relying on God's strength and promises during difficult times.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Peter_5_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Peter 5:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_5_10_s_message_on_enduring_trials.htm">How does 1 Peter 5:10 encourage perseverance during personal trials and suffering?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_God_of_all_grace_mean.htm">What does "God of all grace" reveal about God's character in 1 Peter 5:10?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_restore_confirm_etc_daily.htm">How can we apply "restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish" in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_5_10_Romans_8_28_connection.htm">How does 1 Peter 5:10 connect with Romans 8:28 about God's purpose?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_God_s_grace_in_tough_times.htm">In what ways can you seek God's grace during challenging times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_5_10_Comfort_in_suffering.htm">How does 1 Peter 5:10 provide comfort during times of suffering and hardship?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_5_10_God_s_purpose_in_suffering.htm">What does 1 Peter 5:10 reveal about God's purpose for allowing suffering?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_5_10_and_divine_grace_link.htm">How does 1 Peter 5:10 relate to the concept of divine grace?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_peter_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Peter 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_can_i_cultivate_grace.htm">How can I cultivate grace?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_handle_betrayal_and_deceit.htm">How are we justified by faith in Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_being_full_of_compassion.htm">Will you endure suffering for a little while?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'benediction'_mean_biblically.htm">What does "benediction" mean in the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Peter 5:10 Mean</div><b>And after you have suffered for a little while</b><p>&#8226; Peter is realistic: believers do suffer, but the Spirit underscores that it is &#8220;for a little while&#8221; (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, &#8220;Our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal glory&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This perspective keeps hearts anchored.

The moment of the call was that when St. Paul and the others first preached there. (See <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever.

All time is short in comparison of what comes after. The original looks as if St. Peter meant not only "<span class= "ital">after</span> that ye have suffered," but also "by the fact of your having suffered."<p><span class= "bld">Make you perfect.</span>--Strictly these are futures, "<span class= "ital">shall</span> (or, <span class= "ital">will</span>)<span class= "ital"> make you perfect"</span> &c.

It implies the reduction to order and fitness for work of what is disordered or broken. The others, which are all very similar in meaning, are heaped up after St. Peter's manner. Bengel thus explains them: "Make you perfect, that there remain no defect in you. Stablish, that nothing shake you. Strengthen, that you may overcome all force brought against you." The word for "to settle" means "to found," to give a solid foundation. All this is to take place at the close of the short spell of suffering which is the means to it. St. Peter seems, therefore, to contemplate the passing off of the persecution before the end of the world; for these verbs could hardly be so naturally used to express our education in the world to come. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the God of all grace</span> (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>, "the God of all comfort"). St. Peter has finished his exhortations; he has told his readers what they must do; he now bids them look to God, and tells them where they will find strength. God will work within them both to will and to do of his good pleasure; for he is the God of all grace. All that grace by which we are saved, without which we can do nothing, comes from him as its Author and Source. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who called you</span>... <span class="accented">in Christ Jesus</span>. All the best manuscripts read "you" instead of us. Two of the most ancient omit "Jesus" here. God called us "in Christ;" that is, through spiritual union with Christ; the glory is promised to these who are one with Christ; for the glory is Christ's, and his members will share it. The very end and purpose of our calling was that we might inherit that glory. This is the apostle's great topic of consolation. <span class="cmt_word">After that ye have suffered a while</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a little</span>. The word may refer to the degree, as well as to the duration, of the sufferings. They are transient; the glory is eternal. They may seem very severe, but they are light in comparison with that "far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." <span class="cmt_word">Make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</span> The manuscripts vary between the future and the optative in these four verbs; the preponderance of evidence seems in favor of the future. The emphatic pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> must not be omitted. Translate therefore, "shall himself make you perfect." He only can "perfect what is lacking in our faith" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>, where the same verb is used); and he will do it. This is our hope and encouragement. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "to finish, to complete, to repair." It is the word used in the account of the calling of Peter and Andrew, James and John, by the Sea of Galilee, when the two last were in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> their nets. God will repair, bring to completion, what is lacking in the character of his chosen, if they persevere in prayer, if they are sober and vigilant (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">Stablish</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The Lord had said to St. Peter, "When thou art converted, strengthen <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> thy brethren" (<a href="/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>); Peter remembers his Master's words. <span class="accented">Strengthen</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The word occurs only here. <span class="accented">Settle</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; literally, "shall ground you, shall give you a firm foundation." "Digna <span class="accented">Petro</span> oratio, 'Confirmat fratres sues,'" says Bengel (comp. <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>). The word is omitted in the Vatican and Alexandrine Manuscripts; but it is found in the Sinaitic and other manuscripts and versions, and ought to be retained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[after you] have suffered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pathontas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3958.htm">Strong's 3958: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am acted upon in a certain way, either good or bad; I experience ill treatment, suffer. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">for a little while,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8000;&#955;&#943;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oligon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3641.htm">Strong's 3641: </a> </span><span class="str2">Puny; especially neuter somewhat.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
