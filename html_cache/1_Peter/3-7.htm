The phrase "in the same way" suggests that husbands are to emulate the humility and submission to God's will that Christ demonstrated. This reflects the broader biblical theme of mutual submission found in <a href="/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21</a>, where believers are called to submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.<p><b>treat your wives with consideration</b><br>The call for husbands to be considerate implies an understanding and empathetic approach to their wives. This aligns with the biblical principle of love and respect within marriage, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>, where husbands are instructed to love their wives as Christ loved the church. The cultural context of the time often placed women in a subordinate role, but this directive elevates the treatment of wives to one of thoughtful care and respect.<p><b>as a delicate vessel</b><br>The term "delicate vessel" acknowledges the physical and emotional differences between men and women, without implying inferiority. In the ancient world, vessels were often made of clay or other fragile materials, symbolizing the need for careful handling. This metaphor encourages husbands to be gentle and protective, recognizing the value and dignity of their wives. It echoes the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18-24</a>, where woman is created as a suitable partner for man.<p><b>and with honor as fellow heirs of the gracious gift of life</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the spiritual equality of husbands and wives before God. Both are "fellow heirs" of the gift of eternal life, highlighting the shared inheritance in Christ. This concept is reinforced in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, which states that there is neither male nor female in Christ, but all are one. The "gracious gift of life" refers to the salvation and eternal life offered through Jesus, underscoring the importance of mutual respect and honor in the marital relationship.<p><b>so that your prayers will not be hindered</b><br>The effectiveness of a husband's prayers is linked to his treatment of his wife, suggesting that relational harmony impacts spiritual life. This reflects the biblical principle that unresolved conflict can obstruct one's relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>, where reconciliation is prioritized before offering gifts at the altar. The warning serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of human relationships and spiritual well-being.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

We are hardly to take this as a separate paragraph from the foregoing, but rather as a corollary added to it, to correct a false impression that might otherwise have been conveyed.<p><span class= "bld">Dwell.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">dwelling.</span> The participle is attached to the previous sentences, just as in <a href="/1_peter/2-16.htm" title="As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.">1Peter 2:16</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>; but St. Peter does not like to say to the husbands "submitting yourselves" (though it is implied in the "likewise"), and conveys the deference which the husbands are to pay under other terms: such as "according to knowledge," "giving honour."<p><span class= "bld">With them.</span>--The whole order of the sentences needs re-arrangement as follows: <span class= "ital">Ye husbands, likewise, dwelling according to knowledge, as with a weaker vessel, with what is female, apportioning honour as to joint heirs also of a grace of life.</span> In order to understand this very hard passage, we must remember what is St. Peter's object all throughout these instructions, viz., to commend Christianity to jealous watchers without. Here, therefore, we may well suppose that he is thinking chiefly of the case of believing husbands (Jewish) married to unbelieving wives (Jewish also), thus presenting the counter-picture to that of <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>. And the first thing is that they are to "dwell with" these wives, not to divorce them, nor to cease from conjugal cohabitation with them; such harshness would lend very little attractiveness to the Christian religion among the Jewish homes to which the divorced wife would turn. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>--a passage which must almost have been in St. Peter's mind.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise, ye husbands</span>. As wives are exhorted to be in subjection to their own husbands, so husbands also must do their duty to their wives. The construction (participial as in ver. 1) seems, like ver. 1, to look back to <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>. The relation, indeed, is no longer directly one of subjection, and marriage is an ordinance of God; but Christian husbands must submit themselves to the duties arising out of the marriage tie; and marriage involves a civil contract, though to us Christians it is a holy estate instituted of God, and a parable of the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church. St. Peter, we observe, does not consider the case of a Christian husband with an unbelieving wife; probably that would be very uncommon. <span class="cmt_word">Dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">living together with the feminine as with the weaker vessel.</span> This connection seems best suited to the balance of the sentence, and also to the sense. The apostle bids the husband, first, to give due consideration to his partner on the ground of her comparative weakness; and, secondly, to give her due honor as being an heir, like himself, of the grace of life. The disparity of the sexes was the cause of the degradation of woman among the heathen; Christianity makes it the ground of tender consideration. Christian love should abound in knowledge (<a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>); it should throw its softening light upon all the relations of life. Man and woman are alike vessels - vessels made by God for his service (comp. <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>, etc.; also <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4, 5</a>); the woman is the weaker, and must, for that very reason, be treated with gentleness. For "according to knowledge," comp. <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a>. Christians must be thoughtful; they must consider what becomes them in all the relations of life; not act carelessly and at random. <span class="cmt_word">And as being heirs together of the grace of life</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rendering honor as to those who are also fellow-heirs</span>, or, according to another well-supported reading, <span class="accented">rendering honor</span> (<span class="accented">to them</span>) <span class="accented">as being also fellow-heirs</span> (<span class="accented">with them</span>). The sense is not materially affected: husband and wife are joint-heirs of the grace of life, that is, of God's gracious gift of everlasting life. <span class="cmt_word">That your prayers be not hindered</span>; or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">be not cut</span> off. If husband and wife live together without mutual reverence and affection, there can be no sympathy in united prayer; the promise made by Christ in <a href="/matthew/18-19.htm">Matthew 18:19</a> cannot be realized. Nor can either pray acceptably if they live at variance; jealousies and bickerings are opposed to the spirit of prayer; they hinder the free flow of prayer, and mar its earnestness and devotion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Husbands,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(andres)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_435.htm">Strong's 435: </a> </span><span class="str2">A male human being; a man, husband.
