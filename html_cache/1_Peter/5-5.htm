The call for young men to submit to their elders reflects a broader biblical principle of respecting authority and learning from those with more experience. In the cultural context of the early church, elders were often leaders or overseers within the community, responsible for guiding and teaching. This submission is not about blind obedience but about a willingness to learn and grow under the guidance of those who are spiritually mature. The phrase "in the same way" connects this instruction to previous exhortations in the letter, where submission is a recurring theme (<a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-3</a>:7). This reflects a broader biblical pattern of mutual submission within the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21</a>.<p><b>And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another,</b><br>The imagery of clothing oneself with humility suggests an intentional and visible adoption of a humble attitude. In the Greco-Roman world, clothing was a significant marker of identity and status. By using this metaphor, the text encourages believers to make humility a defining characteristic of their interactions. Humility is a central Christian virtue, exemplified by Jesus Christ, who humbled Himself by taking on human form and serving others (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). This call to humility is not just for young men but for all members of the community, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and service. The concept of humility is counter-cultural, both in the ancient world, where honor and status were highly valued, and in many modern contexts.<p><b>because, &#8220;God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a quotation from <a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>, highlighting a timeless biblical principle. The opposition of God to the proud underscores the seriousness of pride as a sin. Pride is often seen as the root of other sins, leading individuals to rely on their own strength and wisdom rather than on God. In contrast, humility opens the way for God's grace, as it acknowledges dependence on Him. This principle is echoed throughout Scripture, including in <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>, reinforcing the idea that God's favor rests on those who recognize their need for Him. The promise of grace to the humble is a powerful encouragement for believers to adopt a posture of humility, trusting that God will lift them up in due time (<a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who authored this epistle, providing guidance and encouragement to the early Christian communities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/y/younger_believers.htm">Younger Believers</a></b><br>Refers to those who are younger in age or perhaps in faith, instructed to submit to their elders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>Leaders within the church community, responsible for guiding and shepherding the flock.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority who opposes pride and bestows grace upon the humble.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, facing various trials and needing encouragement in their faith journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_submission.htm">The Importance of Submission</a></b><br>Submission is a key aspect of Christian living, reflecting a heart that is willing to learn and grow under the guidance of those more mature in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/clothing_ourselves_with_humility.htm">Clothing Ourselves with Humility</a></b><br>Just as clothing is essential for daily life, humility should be an integral part of our spiritual attire, influencing our interactions with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride sets us against God, as it elevates self above others and even above God&#8217;s authority.

Choosing humility is choosing God&#8217;s side, and with His grace comes unity, growth, and joy for the entire body.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Likewise, ye younger.</span>--Self-submission has been, at least tacitly, inculcated upon the pastors in <a href="/1_peter/5-3.htm" title="Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.">1Peter 5:3</a>; so the writer can say "likewise" in turning to the rest. In comparison with the presbyters or elders, the lay people are styled "younger," or "juniors;" although in point of natural age, or of baptismal seniority, they might be the older. So our Lord addresses His disciples (according to the rabbinical fashion) as "children," though there is good reason to suppose that several were older than Himself; and St. Paul, in the same way, called all the Corinthian Christians his "sons." This seems to be the most natural interpretation of the word; for it was undoubtedly in respect of the supposed juniority of the whole of the lay people that their rulers received the name of "presbyters." Otherwise there is nothing against the interpretation which makes "ye younger to be an address to those who held inferior offices in the Church, such as deacons, catechists, readers, and the like (<a href="/acts/5-6.htm" title="And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.">Acts 5:6</a>; <a href="/acts/5-10.htm" title="Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.">Acts 5:10</a>). The danger of any insubordination of the laity or inferior clergy against the priesthood at such a crisis was very obvious.<p><span class= "bld">Yea, all of you.</span>--Here the true text strikes out the words "be subject and," so that the clause will run, <span class= "ital">Yea, all of you be clothed with humility one to another.</span> Not only mutual complaisance between rulers on the one hand and ruled on the other, but clergy to clergy and laity to laity are to behave with the same self-suppression.<p><span class= "bld">Be clothed with humility.</span>--The Greek verb is a rare and curious one. It means properly, "tie yourselves up in humility." Humility is to be gathered tight round about us like a cloak, and <span class= "ital">tied up</span> so that the wind may not blow it back, nor the rain beat inside it. But there is a still further and more delicate shade of meaning in the word. There was a peculiar kind of cape, well known by a name taken from this verb (we might call it a "tie-up"), and this kind of cape was worn by slaves, and by no others. It was a badge of servitude. Thus St. Peter bids them all gird themselves for one another in a slave's "tie-up" of humility. None are to be masters in the Church of Christ. And the humility is to be the very first thing noticed about them, their outward mark and sign.<p><span class= "bld">For God resisteth the proud.</span>--The exhortation to mutual self-submission is reinforced by a quotation of a well-known proverb. The proverb is based on the LXX. translation of <a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm" title="Surely he scorns the scorners: but he gives grace to the lowly.">Proverbs 3:34</a>; but as it differs somewhat from both the Hebrew and the Greek of that passage, and is found word for word in <a href="/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace. Why he said, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.">James 4:6</a>, we may probably give the same account of it as of the other proverb quoted in <a href="/1_peter/4-8.htm" title="And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.">1Peter 4:8</a>, where see Note. A sad calamity for Christians under persecution, suddenly to find God Himself in array on the enemy's side! (such is the meaning of "resisteth"); and this is what they <span class= "ital">would</span> find, if they went against discipline. On the other hand, if they were submissive, He would bestow "grace" upon them; here again, perhaps, not in the strict theological sense, but in that of "favour." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder</span>. Is St. Peter still using the last word in its official sense? or is he passing to its ordinary meaning? It seems impossible to answer the question with certainty. Some think that the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, younger, had also acquired an official meaning, and that it is used here, and in <a href="/acts/5-6.htm">Acts 5:6</a> of assistant-ministers who were employed to help the presbyters and apostles. Others think that it had a meaning nearly equivalent to our "laity" as distinguished from the presbyters. But, on the whole, it seems more natural to suppose that the word "elder," when once used, led St. Peter on from one meaning to another, and that here he is simply speaking of the respect due to age (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/5-1.htm">1 Timothy 5:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, all of you be subject one to another.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, rendered "be subject," is omitted in the most ancient manuscripts. If their reading is adopted, the dative, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "<span class="accented">one</span> to another," may be taken either with the previous clause," Submit yourselves unto the elder; yea, all of you, to one another;" or with that which follows, "<span class="accented">Be</span> clothed with humility one towards another." <span class="cmt_word">And be clothed with humility.</span> The word rendered "be clothed" <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> occurs here only, and is a remarkable word. It is derived from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a knot or band; the corresponding noun. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, was the name of an apron worn by slaves, which was tied round them when at work, to keep their dress clean. The word seems to teach that humility is a garment which must be firmly fastened on and bound closely round us. The association of the slave's apron seems also to suggest that Christians should be ready to submit to the humblest works of charity for others, and to point back to the lowliness of the Lord Jesus, when he girded himself, and washed the feet of his apostles (<a href="/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4</a>). It may be noticed that the Greek word for "humility" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> is used only by St. Paul, except in this place. <span class="cmt_word">For God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</span> St. Peter is quoting from the Septuagint Version of <a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>, without marks of quotation, as in other places. St. James quotes the same passage (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>), and with the same variation, substituting "God" for "Lord," as St. Peter does. The Greek word for "resisteth <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is a strong one: God rangeth himself as with an army against the haughty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/5-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Young men,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#949;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#333;teroi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Vocative Masculine Plural - Comparative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3501.htm">Strong's 3501: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) young, youthful, (b) new, fresh. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the same way,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;&#956;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Homoi&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3668.htm">Strong's 3668: </a> </span><span class="str2">In like manner, similarly, in the same way, equally.
