He accompanied Paul on his second missionary journey (<a href="/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a>) and was involved in the establishment of several churches. His role as a messenger or scribe for Peter indicates his trusted status within the early church. The use of Silvanus highlights the interconnectedness of early Christian leaders and their collaborative efforts in spreading the Gospel.<p><b>Whom I regard as a faithful brother</b><br>This phrase underscores the deep trust and respect Peter had for Silvanus. The term "faithful brother" suggests a strong bond of Christian fellowship and shared mission. It reflects the early church's emphasis on community and mutual support among believers, as seen in other New Testament writings (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>, where Paul refers to Timothy as a "faithful child in the Lord").<p><b>I have written to you briefly</b><br>Peter acknowledges the concise nature of his letter, which serves as a focused message of encouragement and instruction. The brevity of the letter does not diminish its importance but rather emphasizes the urgency and clarity of its message. This reflects the apostolic practice of writing letters to address specific issues or needs within the early Christian communities.<p><b>Encouraging you and testifying</b><br>The dual purpose of the letter is to provide encouragement and to bear witness to the truth. Encouragement was vital for early Christians facing persecution and trials, as seen throughout the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>). Testifying to the truth aligns with the apostolic mission to affirm the core tenets of the faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32</a>, where Peter testifies to the resurrection of Jesus.<p><b>That this is the true grace of God</b><br>Peter emphasizes the authenticity and reliability of the message he conveys. The "true grace of God" refers to the Gospel and the salvation it offers through Jesus Christ. This grace is a central theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where Paul speaks of salvation by grace through faith. It underscores the unmerited favor and love of God towards humanity.<p><b>Stand firm in it</b><br>The call to "stand firm" is a recurring exhortation in the New Testament, urging believers to remain steadfast in their faith despite challenges (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>). This phrase encourages perseverance and resilience, reminding Christians of the spiritual strength available to them through God's grace.

It is not a common name, and nothing would suggest the doubt, except the acceptance a <span class= "ital">priori</span> of the Tbingen theory, that the feud between St. Peter and St. Paul was so deadly as to preclude the possibility of the first giving his patronage to a friend of the second. We have already seen repeatedly how false that theory is. That the bearer of this Letter was a personage of great consideration, may be seen from the fact that St. Peter speaks of him as well known throughout the whole Hebrew population of Asia Minor. In the original the testimony is still more marked than in our version, as it has the definite article, "<span class= "ital">the, </span>or <span class= "ital">that, </span>faithful brother unto you." Silas being of the circumcision himself (<a href="/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>), St. Peter can without any risk, writing to the Jews, call him "brother." And since there was probably some disaffection towards him among the Jewish Christians, for the way in which he had sided with St. Paul, St. Peter, the Apostle of the circumcision, adds it as his own personal conviction that Silas was no false brother to the Hebrew Christians, by saying, "as I reckon." The words "as I suppose" (or, rather, <span class= "ital">as I reckon</span>) do not imply any uncertainty on St. Peter's part, nor even that St. Peter's knowledge of Silas was less intimate than that of the persons to whom he writes. It means, rather, the most complete confidence in Silas, which the writer is not at all ashamed to declare--"that faithful brother unto you, in my estimation, if my conviction is worth anything." This only shows that St. Peter had not altered his opinion either of Silas or of the relative positions of Jew and Gentile in the Church, since that great council in which he took so prominent a part, when Silas was selected, no doubt because of his uniting liberal views with steadfast allegiance to the Law, to bear the apostolic mandates to the Gentile metropolis of Antioch. The same qualifications which fitted him for that work, would now again serve him in good stead to bear to the Jews of Asia Minor St. Peter's countersignature to the doctrine of St. Paul. At the same time the expression, "that faithful brother unto you," indicates that St. Silas had been himself working in Asia Minor. Of his history nothing is recorded subsequent to his labours with St. Paul at Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2Corinthians 1:19</a>); but putting together the fact that he is not included in the list of St. Paul's companions in <a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>, with what is implied by this present passage, we might naturally infer that he was left at Ephesus, and devoted himself to the evangelisation of the Asiatic provinces. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">by Silvanus</span>, <span class="accented">our faithful brother</span>, <span class="accented">as I account him</span>, <span class="accented">I have written unto you briefly</span>. The preposition "by" <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> has the same sense as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a>. Silvanus was the bearer of the Epistle; he may have been the amanuensis also. In all probability he is the Silas of the Acts of the Apostles, and the Silvanus whose name St. Paul associates with his own in the address of both Epistles to the Thessalonians; he is mentioned also in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>. As the companion of St. Paul, he must have been known to the Churches of Asia Minor. The word rendered in the Authorized Version "I suppose" <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> does not imply any doubt (comp. <a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>; <a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>). The Christians of Asia Minor knew Silvanus as a faithful brother; St. Peter adds his testimony. Some connect it with the clause, "<span class="accented">I</span> have written unto you briefly," as if St. Peter meant to say that he regarded his letter as a short one, the subjects being so important; but this does not seem natural. It is better to take the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, unto you, with the verb "I have written," than with the words, "a faithful brother," as in the Authorized Version. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> is the epistolary aorist, and may therefore be rendered "I write." <span class="cmt_word">Exhorting, and testifying</span>. The general tone of this Epistle is hortatory: St. Peter comforts his readers in the sufferings which were coming on them, and exhorts them to patient endurance. The word rendered "testifying" <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> occurs only here in the New Testament. Bengel and others take the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> in the sense of <span class="accented">insuper</span>, in "addition:" "Petrus insuper testatur;" he adds his testimony to that of Paul and others who have gone before; or, he not only exhorts, he also testifies - the testimony is in addition to the exhortation. But more probably the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> is intensive, or expresses simply the direction of the testifying (comp. <a href="/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>:40, where the same words nearly; the Greek for "testified" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> are used in describing St. Peter's exhortations). <span class="cmt_word">That this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">that this is the true grace of God: stand ye fast therein</span>. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is supported by the oldest manuscripts. The construction involves a common ellipse, "Into which (having entered) stand fast." Some think that it was St. Peter's intention in these words to set the seal of his apostolic authority upon the truth of the teaching which the Christians of Asia Minor had received from St. Paul. It may be so. The whole Epistle corroborates the teaching of St. Paul, and shows St. Peter's exact agreement with it. But it seems probable that, if St. Peter had thought it necessary to give a formal sanction to St. Paul's preaching, he would have done so plainly, as he does at the end of the Second Epistle. Again, there are no traces in the Epistle of any doubts now existing in the minds of the Asiatic Christians, or of any opposition to St. Paul, such as there once had been in the Churches of Corinth and Galatia. And St. Peter does not say, "These are the true doctrines," but "This is the true grace of God." He seems rather to be giving the testimony o&pound; his knowledge and spiritual experience to the fact that the grace which they had received came indeed from God, that it was his true grace, that it was he who was working within them both to will and to do. They must stand fast in that grace, and by its help work out their own salvation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/5-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Silvanus,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(Silouanou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4610.htm">Strong's 4610: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silvanus, a Roman citizen and a helper of Paul.
