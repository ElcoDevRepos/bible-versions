In the biblical context, obedience is a central theme, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people. The imagery of children suggests a familial bond, highlighting the intimacy and care God has for His followers. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ephesians/5.htm">Ephesians 5:1</a>, where believers are called to be imitators of God as beloved children. The idea of obedience also ties back to the Old Testament, where Israel was often referred to as God's children, expected to follow His commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>).<p><b>do not conform</b><br>This directive warns against adopting the behaviors and patterns of the surrounding culture that are contrary to God's will. The term "conform" suggests a pressure to fit into a mold, which in the historical context of the early church, could mean succumbing to pagan practices or societal norms that were inconsistent with Christian teachings. <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a> similarly advises believers not to conform to the world but to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. This call to non-conformity is a reminder of the distinctiveness of the Christian life, set apart for holiness.<p><b>to the passions</b><br>The word "passions" refers to desires or lusts that are often associated with sinful behavior. In the Greco-Roman world, indulgence in various passions was common, and new believers were called to abandon these in favor of a life led by the Spirit. <a href="/galatians/5-24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a> speaks of those who belong to Christ having crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. This transformation is part of the sanctification process, where believers are gradually conformed to the image of Christ.<p><b>of your former ignorance</b><br>This phrase points to the time before the recipients of the letter came to faith in Christ. "Ignorance" here refers to a lack of knowledge about God and His ways, which often led to living in sin. In <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, Paul speaks of God overlooking the times of ignorance but now commanding all people to repent. The call to leave behind former ignorance is a call to embrace the truth of the Gospel and live in the light of that knowledge. This transformation from ignorance to understanding is a key aspect of the Christian journey, as believers grow in their knowledge of God and His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

Winer says ('Grammar,' 3. 34; 'Romans,' 2), "This mode of expression is to be traced to the more lively imagination of the Orientals, by which the most intimate connection (derivation from and dependence on) - even when the reference is to what is not material - is viewed under the image of the relation of son or child to parent. Hence ' children of disobedience' are those who belong to disobedience as a child to his mother - disobedience having become their nature, their predominant disposition."

It implies that men who live in sensual lusts take up the likeness of those lusts into themselves, and are made, not as man was at first, after the likeness of God, but after the likeness of those lusts of the flesh which are not of the Father, but are of the world. The word "ignorance" is to be taken closely with "lusts" - "the former lusts which were in the time of your ignorance." It seems to imply that St. Peter is addressing Gentiles as well as Jews; top, though ignorance is attributed to the Jews (<a href="/acts/3-17.htm">Acts 3:17</a>; <a href="/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>), it was ignorance, not of the moral law, as here, but of the Person and office of Christ.
