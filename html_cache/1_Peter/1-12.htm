If sinless celestial beings marvel, how much more should redeemed people cherish the gospel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a> shows salvation&#8217;s grand panorama: God revealed forthcoming grace to prophets, who served later believers by writing Scripture. What they predicted has now been proclaimed through Spirit-empowered preachers. Even angels are captivated by this salvation. The verse invites confidence in Scripture, gratitude for our privileged place in redemptive history, and reverent wonder at the gospel that heaven itself delights to behold.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Unto whom it</span> <span class= "bld">was revealed.</span>--As <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1Peter 1:11</a> expanded and expounded the words "inquired and searched," so the first part of <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a> expounds the words "prophesied of the grace in reserve for you." That is to say, the revelation here spoken of is not a special revelation sent in answer to their laborious musings, but rather the very thing which occasioned them; the perplexity consisted in feeling that God had a further meaning for their words. And the exact limits of the revelation are mentioned: they were shown that they spoke for the benefit of futurity, and no more! What a "trial of faith!" What a sublime disappointment! (<a href="/hebrews/11-40.htm" title="God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.">Hebrews 11:40</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Unto us.</span>--Far the better reading is, <span class= "ital">unto you.</span> It is a distinct characteristic of this Epistle, that "we," "us," "our," are so seldom used (in the best text) where they might have been expected. Where St. Paul throws in his own sympathy, and puts himself on a footing with those whom he addresses, St. Peter utters his lofty pastoral from above. There are but four places in the Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1Peter 4:17</a>) where he associates himself thus with his brethren, and one of those (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>) is really a quotation, and one (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>) at best a very doubtful reading. The same tendency may be observed in his speech (<a href="/acts/15-7.htm" title="And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.">Acts 15:7</a>), where the right reading is "made choice among <span class= "ital">you.</span>" . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things.</span> It was revealed to them, whether in answer to their search as in the case of Daniel, or as part of the original revelation made to them, that the vision was for many days (<a href="/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>). Compare St. Peter's quotations from the prophetic Scriptures in <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17, 31</a>; <a href="/acts/3-24.htm">Acts 3:24</a>. The best manuscripts read here, "unto you." The prophets, doubtless, like Abraham, rejoiced to see the day of Christ; they saw it by faith, and were glad (<a href="/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>); but they saw it in the far distance; they desired to see and hear what the apostles saw and heard, but the time was not yet (see <a href="/matthew/13-16.htm">Matthew 13:16, 17</a>). <span class="accented">They did minister the things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they were made the instruments of revealing them; they presented them to the devout for their spiritual food and support. Which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost lent down from heaven; rather, <span class="accented">which were now reported to you through them that preached the gospel unto you</span> (literally, <span class="accented">evangelized you</span>) <span class="accented">by the Holy Ghost</span>. St. Peter claims for those who evangelized Asia Minor (St. Paul and his companions) the same authority which was possessed by the ancient prophets; they preached as fulfilled the great truths which the prophets foretold as future. The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets; the same Spirit worked and preached through the apostles; nay, he dwelt in them in fuller measure, for he had been sent down from heaven on the great Day of Pentecost, and it was by his aid that the apostles and evangelists preached. Which things the angels desire to look into. The salvation which God's elect receive is so full of glory and mysterious beauty, that not only did the prophets of old search diligently, but even an gels (there is no article) desire to look into it. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "to stoop sideways;" it is used of persons standing outside a place who stoop in order to look in. "The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> of the verb," says Huther, "indicates that the angels stand outside the work of redemption, inasmuch as it is not for them, but for man (cf. <a href="/hebrews/2-16.htm">Hebrews 2:16</a>)." The same verb occurs in <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5, 11</a>; <a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>, in which last place it is used of Peter himself, when he stooped to look into the empty sepulcher on the morning of the Lord's resurrection. St. Paul has a similar thought in <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>, "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God." The attitude of the golden cherubim, whose wings covered the mercy-seat and whose faces were toward it (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>), seems to imply the same rapt, reverent attention. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">It was revealed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#973;&#966;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(apekalyphth&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_601.htm">Strong's 601: </a> </span><span class="str2">To uncover, bring to light, reveal.
