In the context of 1 Peter, the "they" refers to those who malign believers for their faith and lifestyle. The concept of giving an account is rooted in the biblical understanding of stewardship and responsibility, as seen in parables like the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). It underscores the idea that all actions and words are subject to divine scrutiny, aligning with passages such as <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>, which states that each person will give an account of themselves to God.<p><b>to Him who is ready to judge</b><br>This phrase highlights the immediacy and preparedness of God to execute judgment. The readiness of God to judge reflects His omniscience and omnipotence, ensuring that justice is not delayed. This readiness is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>, where Jesus is described as the one appointed by God to judge the living and the dead. The phrase also serves as a warning to those who live in opposition to God's will, reminding them of the impending judgment.<p><b>the living and the dead</b><br>This phrase indicates the comprehensive scope of God's judgment, encompassing all humanity, regardless of their state. The living and the dead include those currently alive and those who have passed away, affirming the universal nature of divine judgment. This concept is echoed in <a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>, where Christ is described as the judge of the living and the dead. It also connects to the resurrection of the dead, a core Christian belief, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-21.htm">1 Corinthians 15:21-22</a>, which speaks of all being made alive in Christ. This phrase assures believers of ultimate justice and vindication, while serving as a sobering reminder of accountability for all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, writing to encourage and instruct believers facing persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge who will hold everyone accountable, both the living and the dead.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_living_and_the_dead.htm">The Living and the Dead</a></b><br>Refers to all humanity, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, who were experiencing trials and needed reassurance of God's justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_day.htm">Judgment Day</a></b><br>The future event when God will judge all people, a central theme in Christian eschatology.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_before_god.htm">Accountability Before God</a></b><br>Every person will stand before God to give an account of their life.
