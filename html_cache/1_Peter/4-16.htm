Suffering as a Christian implies facing persecution or hardship specifically because of one's faith in Jesus Christ. In the early church, believers often faced hostility from both Jewish and Roman authorities. This suffering is not due to wrongdoing but is a result of living out one's faith. The Apostle Peter, who wrote this letter, was familiar with persecution, having been imprisoned and beaten for his faith (<a href="/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40-41</a>).<p><b>do not be ashamed</b><br>Shame was a powerful social tool in the ancient world, often used to control behavior. However, Peter encourages believers not to feel disgrace for their faith. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>, where He warns against being ashamed of Him and His words. The call is to stand firm in faith, recognizing that suffering for Christ is a badge of honor rather than a source of shame.<p><b>but glorify God</b><br>Glorifying God in the midst of suffering is a recurring theme in the New Testament. It reflects a deep trust in God's sovereignty and goodness, even when circumstances are difficult. This aligns with Paul's exhortation in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a> to do everything for the glory of God. Suffering provides an opportunity to demonstrate the transformative power of the Gospel and to witness to others through one's response.<p><b>that you bear that name</b><br>Bearing the name "Christian" signifies belonging to Christ and being part of His body, the Church. This identity is both a privilege and a responsibility. In biblical times, names held significant meaning, often reflecting character or destiny. To bear the name of Christ is to be associated with His mission, His suffering, and His ultimate victory. This is reminiscent of the promise in <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, where believers are assured of a new name written by God, symbolizing eternal belonging and identity in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

Tacitus, for instance, says: "Those who were <span class= "ital">vulgarly</span> known by the name of Christians." In fact, it is quite an open question whether we ought not here (as well as in the two places of Acts above cited) to read the nickname in its barbarous form: <span class= "ital">Chrestian.</span> The Sinaitic manuscript has that form, and the Vatican has the form <span class= "ital">Chreistian</span>; and it is much harder to suppose that a scribe who commonly called himself a <span class= "ital">Christian</span> would intentionally alter it into this strange form than to suppose that one who did not understand the irony of saying a <span class= "ital">Chrestian</span> should have written the word with which he was so familiar.<p><span class= "bld">Let him not be ashamed.</span>--Although the name sounds worse to the world than "murderer," or "thief," or "malefactor."<p><span class= "bld">On this behalf.</span>--This is a possible rendering, but it is more pointed to translate literally, <span class= "ital">but let him glorify God in this name</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>make even this name of ridicule the ground of an act of glory to God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet if any man suffer as a Christian</span>. The word "Christian" occurs only three times in the New Testament - twice in the Acts of the Apostles (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>; <a href="/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>), and here. "The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch." They were originally described amongst themselves as "the disciples," "the brethren," "the believers," "the elect," or" the saints;" by the Jews they were called "the Nazarenes" (<a href="/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>), as still in Mohammedan countries. The name was probably invented by the heathen, and used at first as a term of derision; there is something of scorn in Agrippa's use of it. It did not at once become common among the disciples of the Lord. St. Peter (who preached at Antioch (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>), and is said to have been Bishop of Antioch) is the only sacred writer who adopts it instead of the older names, and that only ones, and in connection with threatened persecution. St. James may possibly allude to it in <a href="/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>. But it was not commonly used among' believers till after New Testament times. Then they began to discern its admirable suitableness. It reminded them that the center of their religion was not a system of doctrines, but a Person, and that Person the Messiah, the Anointed of God. The Hebrew origin of the word, the Greek dress, the Latin termination, seemed to point, like the threefold inscription on the cross, to the universality of Christ's religion to its empire, first over all the civilized nations, and through them, by continually increasing triumphs, over the whole world. It reminded them that they too were anointed, that they had an unction from the Holy One. Its very corruption through heathen ignorance, <span class="accented">Christian</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, good (the Sinaitic Manuscript has <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in this place) had its lesson - it spoke of sweetness and of goodness. See the oft-quoted passage from Tertullian: "Sed quum et perperam Chres-tiani nuncupamur a vobis (nam nec nominis certa est notitia penes yes) de suavitate et benignitate compositum est." <span class="cmt_word">Let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</span> The best-supported reading is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>. This may be understood as an idiom, in the same sense as the reading of the Authorized Version; but it is better to translate it literally, <span class="accented">in this name, i.e.</span> either the name of Christ, or (more probably, perhaps) that of Christian. <span class="cmt_word">The heathen blasphemed that worthy Name</span>; suffering Christians must not be ashamed of it, but, as the holy martyrs did, utter their "Christianus sum" with inward peace and thanksgiving, glorifying God that he had given them grace to bear that honored Name and to suffer for Christ. Bengel says here, "Poterat Petrus dicere, honori sibi ducat: sed honorem Dee resignandum esse docet." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/4-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if [you suffer]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
