This faith is not merely intellectual assent but a deep trust and reliance on God. <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> defines faith as "the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." This faith is a gift from God (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>) and is essential for salvation. It is through faith that believers are justified (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>) and live (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>).<p><b>are shielded by God&#8217;s power</b><br>The Greek word for "shielded" (phroureo) implies a military guard, suggesting protection and security. This indicates that believers are under divine protection, much like a fortress guarded by soldiers. God's power is omnipotent, ensuring that nothing can separate believers from His love (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>). This protection is not from physical harm but from spiritual defeat, preserving the believer's faith until the end.<p><b>for the salvation</b><br>Salvation in this context refers to the full realization of deliverance from sin and its consequences. While believers experience aspects of salvation now, such as justification and sanctification, the ultimate salvation includes glorification, which will be fully realized in the future (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>). This salvation is a central theme throughout Scripture, promised in the Old Testament and fulfilled in Jesus Christ (Isaiah 53, <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>that is ready to be revealed</b><br>The phrase indicates that this salvation is prepared and awaiting revelation. It emphasizes the certainty and imminence of God's promise. The readiness of salvation reflects God's sovereign plan, which has been in place since before the foundation of the world (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). This future revelation is a source of hope and encouragement for believers, urging them to live in anticipation of Christ's return.<p><b>in the last time</b><br>The "last time" refers to the eschatological period, the end of the current age when Christ will return. This is a common theme in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to live in light of the coming day of the Lord (<a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>). The last time is characterized by the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, the final judgment, and the establishment of a new heaven and new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>). This future perspective provides motivation for holy living and perseverance in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle of Jesus Christ, traditionally believed to be the author of this epistle.

Bengel says, "As the inheritance hath been preserved, so are the heirs guarded; neither shall it fail them, nor they it."<p><span class= "bld">Through faith.</span>--The Apostle is fearful lest the last words should give a false assurance. God can guard none of us, in spite of His "power," unless there be a corresponding exertion upon our part--which is here called "faith"--combining the notions of staunch fidelity and of trustfulness in spite of appearances. It is through such trustful fidelity that we are guarded.<p><span class= "bld">Unto salvation</span>.--These words "unto" arise like point beyond point in the endless vista. "Begotten <span class= "ital">unto</span> an inheritance, which hath bee reserved unto you, who are kept safe unto a deliverance." This Salvation, spoken of again in <a href="/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1Peter 1:9</a>, must not be taken in the bald sense of salvation from damnation. Indeed, the thought of the perdition of the lost does not enter at all into the passage. The salvation, or deliverance, is primarily a deliverance from all the trials and persecutions, struggles and temptations of this life--an emergence into the state of peace and rest, as we can see from the verses that follow.<p><span class= "bld">Ready to be revealed in the last time.</span>--How such an assurance helps to form the very "faith" through which the treasure is secured! That perfect state of peace, that heavenly inheritance, is not something to be prepared hereafter, but <span class= "ital">there it is.</span> If only our eyes were opened, we should already see it. It is all ready, only waiting for the great moment. The tense of the word "revealed" implies the suddenness of the unveiling. It will be but the work of an instant to put aside the curtain and show the inheritance which has been kept hidden so long behind it. This, however, will not take place till the <span class= "ital">exact</span> period (so the word for "time" suggests; comp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2Thessalonians 2:6</a>), and that period will be the last of the world's history. For such teaching the Hebrews would be well prepared by the Old Testament--for instance, comp. <a href="/daniel/12-9.htm" title="And he said, Go your way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.">Daniel 12:9</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-13.htm" title="But go you your way till the end be: for you shall rest, and stand in your lot at the end of the days.">Daniel 12:13</a>--and it was the earliest kind teaching culled for converts out of the "oracles of God" (<a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Who are kept by the power of God.

"The governor under Areas the king <span class="accented">kept</span> [guarded] the city of the Damascenes" (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>); the peace of God shall <span class="accented">keep</span> ("guard." <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>) the hearts of those who trust in him, - they are guarded by a heavenly host; "The angel of the Lord encampeth around them that fear him;" they are guarded by, or rather, according to the exact rendering, <span class="accented">in</span> the power of God. His power is all around them; it is the sphere in which they live and move; no harm can reach them in that all-embracing shelter. Through faith. Faith, the evidence of things not seen, realizes the presence of the heavenly guard, and gives courage and confidence to the Christian when assailed by temptations and dangers; the servant of Elisha feared no more the hosts of Syria, when he saw the mountain full of chariots and horses of fire round about his master. Faith is the instrument by means of which we grasp the Divine strength, so that it is made perfect in our weakness. Unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. By "salvation" St. Peter means not merely present deliverance from sin, but everlasting life, the joy of our Lord, the deep, full blessedness of his elect in heaven. Eye hath not seen it yet, it hath not entered into the heart of man. But it is ready to be revealed; the veil which now hides it from us will be withdrawn in the last time, when the last page of this world's history shall have been written, when the number of the elect shall be accomplished, and the eternal purpose of God shall have been fulfilled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
