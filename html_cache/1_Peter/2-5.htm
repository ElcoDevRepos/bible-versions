The audience, primarily Gentile believers, is being addressed as part of a larger community. This reflects the New Testament theme of the church as the body of Christ, where all believers are united in purpose and identity.<p><b>like living stones</b><br>The metaphor of "living stones" suggests that believers are dynamic and integral parts of the spiritual structure God is building. This imagery contrasts with the inanimate stones of the physical temple, emphasizing the living and active nature of the church. It also connects to Jesus as the "living stone" rejected by men but chosen by God (<a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm">1 Peter 2:4</a>).<p><b>are being built into a spiritual house</b><br>This phrase highlights the ongoing process of spiritual growth and formation. The "spiritual house" refers to the church, the dwelling place of God, echoing the Old Testament temple. The continuous tense "are being built" suggests that this is an ongoing work of God, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>, where believers are described as being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.<p><b>to be a holy priesthood</b><br>The concept of a "holy priesthood" signifies that all believers have direct access to God and are set apart for His service. This is a fulfillment of <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, where Israel was called to be a kingdom of priests. It underscores the priestly role of intercession and worship, previously reserved for the Levitical priesthood, now extended to all believers through Christ.<p><b>offering spiritual sacrifices</b><br>"Spiritual sacrifices" refer to acts of worship and service that are pleasing to God, such as prayer, praise, and acts of love and charity. This is in contrast to the physical sacrifices of the Old Testament, indicating a shift from ritualistic offerings to those that are heartfelt and spirit-led, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to offer their bodies as living sacrifices.<p><b>acceptable to God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the sacrifices offered by believers are pleasing to God, not because of their own merit, but because they are offered in faith and obedience. It reflects the biblical principle that God desires obedience and a contrite heart over ritualistic offerings (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>).<p><b>through Jesus Christ</b><br>The mediating role of Jesus Christ is central here, as it is through Him that believers' sacrifices are made acceptable to God. This underscores the New Testament teaching that Jesus is the sole mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>) and that all spiritual blessings and access to God come through Him (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle of Jesus Christ, traditionally believed to be the author of this epistle, addressing early Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_stones.htm">Living Stones</a></b><br>A metaphor for believers, indicating their role in the spiritual structure of the Church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_house.htm">Spiritual House</a></b><br>Represents the collective body of believers, the Church, as a dwelling place for God's presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_priesthood.htm">Holy Priesthood</a></b><br>Refers to the role of believers as mediators who offer spiritual sacrifices to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The cornerstone and foundation of the spiritual house, through whom believers' sacrifices are made acceptable to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>As living stones, believers find their identity and purpose in being part of God's spiritual house.

All of it rises as a pleasing aroma to the Father solely because it passes through the worth and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up</span>.--This is true enough: they <span class= "ital">were</span> in process of building up; but it suits the hortatory character of the whole Epistle better to take it (the one is as grammatical as the other) in the <span class= "ital">imperative</span> sense: <span class= "ital">Be ye also as living stones built up.</span> The rendering "lively," instead of "living," as in <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a>, is arbitrary, the Greek being precisely the same, and the intention being to show the complete conformation of the believers to Him who is the type and model for humanity. "Built up," too, only expresses a part of the Greek word, which implies "built up <span class= "ital">upon</span> Him."<p><span class= "bld">A spiritual house.</span>--The epithet is supplied, just as in "<span class= "ital">living</span> stone," to make it abundantly clear that the language is figurative. In the first three verses of the chapter these Hebrew Christians were treated <span class= "ital">individually, </span>as so many babes, to grow up into an ideal <span class= "ital">freedom of soul</span>: here they are treated <span class= "ital">collectively</span> (of course, along with the Gentile Christians), as so many stones, incomplete and unmeaning in themselves, by arrangement and cemented union to rise into an ideal <span class= "ital">house of God.</span> St. Peter does not distinctly say that the "house" is a temple (for the word "spiritual" is only the opposite of "material"), but the context makes it plain that such is the case. The temple is, however, regarded not in its capacity of a place for <span class= "ital">worship</span> so much as a place for Divine <span class= "ital">inhabitation.</span> "The spiritual house," says Leighton truly, "is the palace of the Great King. The Hebrew word for <span class= "ital">palace</span> and <span class= "ital">temple</span> is one." And the reason for introducing this figure seems to be, to console the Hebrews for their vanishing privileges in the temple at Jerusalem. They are being taught to recognise that they themselves, in their union with one another, and with Jesus Christ, are the true abode of the Most High. The Christian substitution of something else in lieu of the Jerusalem Temple was one of the greatest stumbling-blocks to the Hebrews from the very first. (See <a href="/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a>; <a href="/john/2-21.htm" title="But he spoke of the temple of his body.">John 2:21</a>; <a href="/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,">Acts 7:48</a>; <a href="/acts/21-28.htm" title="Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.">Acts 21:28</a>; compare also <a href="/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>.) All history is the process of building up a "spiritual palace" out of a regenerate humanity, in order that, in the end, the <span class= "ital">Father Himself</span> may occupy it. This follows from the fact that the Incarnate <span class= "ital">Son</span> is described as a <span class= "ital">part</span> of the Temple. Even through the Incarnation--at least so far as it has as yet taken effect--creation has not become so completely pervaded and filled with the Deity as it is destined to be when the "palace" is finished. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1Corinthians 15:28</a>.) The idea of the Eternal Son occupying such a relation to the Father on the one hand, and to humanity and creation on the other hand, is really the same as when He is called (by an entirely different metaphor) the "firstborn of all creation" (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye also, as lively stones</span>; rather, <span class="accented">living stones</span>. The word is the same as that used in ver. 4. Christians are living stones in virtue of their union with the one living Stone: "Because I live, ye shall live also." <span class="cmt_word">Are built up a spiritual house</span>; rather, <span class="accented">be ye built up</span>. The imperative rendering seems more suitable than the indicative, and the passive than the middle. The Christian comes; God builds him up on the one Foundation. The apostle says," Come to be built up; come that ye may be built up." The parallel passage in <a href="/jude/1-20.htm">Jude 1:20</a>, "But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith," might seem to point to a reflexive rendering here; but the verb used by St. Jude is active, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Jude is apparently thinking of the human side of the work, St. Peter of the Divine; in the deepest sense Christ is the Builder as well as the Foundation, as he himself said in words doubtless present to St. Peter's mind, "Upon this rock I will build my Church." That Church is the antitype of the ancient temple - a building not material, but spiritual, consisting, not of dead stones, but of sanctified souls, resting on no earthly foundation, but on that Rock which is Christ (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2, 17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An holy priesthood</span>; rather, for (literally, <span class="accented">into</span>) <span class="accented">a holy priesthood</span>. The figure again changes; the thought of the temple leads to that of the priesthood. The stones in the spiritual temple are <span class="accented">living</span> stones; they are also priests. According to the original ideal of the Hebrew theocracy, all Israelites were to be priests: "Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, a holy nation" (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). This ideal is fulfilled in the Christian Church; it is a holy priesthood. Here and in ver. 9 the Church collectively is called a priesthood; in the Book of the Revelation (Revelation 1:6; 5:10; 20:6) Christians individually are called priests, Bishop Lightfoot says, at the opening of his dissertation on the Christian ministry, "The kingdom of Christ has no sacred days or seasons, no special sanctuaries, because every time and every place alike are holy. Above all, it has no sacerdotal system. It interposes no sacrificial tribe or class between God and man." He continues, "This conception is strictly an ideal, which we must ever hold before our eyes... but which nevertheless cannot supersede the necessary wants of human society, and, if crudely and hastily applied, will lead only to signal failure. As appointed days and set places are indispensable to her efficiency, so also the Church could not fulfill the purposes for which she exists without rulers and teachers, without a ministry of reconciliation, in short, without an order of men who may in some sense be designated a priesthood." The whole Jewish Church was a kingdom of priests; yet there was an Aaronic priesthood. The Christian Church is a holy priesthood; yet there is an order of men who are appointed to exercise the functions of the ministry, and who, as representing the collective priesthood of the whole Church, may be truly called priests. <span class="cmt_word">To offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</span> The priest must have somewhat to offer (<a href="/hebrews/8-3.htm">Hebrews 8:3</a>). The sacrifices of the ancient Law had found their fulfillment in the one all-sufficient Sacrifice, offered once for all by the great High Priest upon the altar of the cross. But there is still sacrifice in the Christian Church. That one Sacrifice is ever present in its atoning virtue and cleansing power; and through that one Sacrifice the priests of the spiritual temple offer up daily spiritual sacrifices - the sacrifice of prayer and praise (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>), the sacrifice of alms and oblations (<a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>), and that sacrifice without which prayer and praise and alms are vain oblations, the sacrifice of self (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). These spiritual sacrifices are offered up through Jesus Christ the great High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>); they derive their value only from faith in his sacrifice of himself; they are efficacious through his perpetual mediation and intercession; through him alone they are acceptable to God. They are offered through him, and they are acceptable through him. The Greek words admit of either connection; and perhaps are intended to cover both relations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(autoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
