In the Roman Empire, where Peter's audience lived, punishment for wrongdoing was common and often harsh. The early Christians were familiar with the legal and social systems that enforced such penalties. The rhetorical question implies that there is no honor or spiritual benefit in enduring punishment that is deserved. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, which speaks of the Lord's discipline as a form of correction for wrongdoing. The idea is that suffering for one's own faults does not bring glory or credit, as it is simply the natural consequence of one's actions.<p><b>But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the distinction between suffering for wrongdoing and suffering for righteousness. The early Christians often faced persecution for their faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>, where the apostles rejoiced for being counted worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus. The concept of enduring suffering for doing good is a recurring theme in the New Testament, reflecting the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who suffered unjustly (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>). This suffering is seen as a participation in Christ's own sufferings, as mentioned in <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>.<p><b>this is commendable before God.</b><br>Enduring suffering for righteousness is portrayed as commendable or praiseworthy in the sight of God. This echoes the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>, where Jesus blesses those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. The commendation from God suggests a divine approval and reward, as seen in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, which promises the crown of life to those who persevere under trial.

For whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). Enduring the harvest of our own wrongdoing is simply the working out of God&#8217;s moral order.<p>&#8226; Parental analogy: Just as children &#8220;obey your parents in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1</a>) to avoid correction, believers are reminded that obedience spares them rightful discipline.<p>&#8226; Divine warning: &#8220;Judgments are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the backs of fools&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/19-29.htm">Proverbs 19:29</a>). Pain for sin is expected; accepting it without complaint does not earn extra favor.<p>&#8226; Apostolic example: Peter later says, &#8220;Let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief or evildoer&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-15.htm">1 Peter 4:15</a>). If suffering springs from evil acts, it is loss, not gain.<p>&#8226; Purpose of chastening: <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a> affirms, &#8220;No discipline seems enjoyable at the time... but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.&#8221; God&#8217;s correction aims at repentance, not reward for stoic endurance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.</b><p>Here Peter turns the spotlight on unjust pain borne by a righteous life, declaring that such patient endurance delights the Lord.<p>&#8226; Christ-centered pattern: &#8220;To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>).

Opposition is not failure; it is confirmation of faithful discipleship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Peter contrasts deserved discipline with undeserved persecution. Enduring consequences for sin earns no spiritual credit; it is simply justice at work. Enduring suffering that comes precisely because we obey Christ, however, wins God&#8217;s approval, mirrors Jesus&#8217; own path, sharpens our character, and stores up eternal reward. The believer therefore evaluates trials not by their pain level but by their purpose: pain from wrongdoing calls for repentance, while pain for righteousness calls for steadfast, joyful endurance, confident that the Father sees, remembers, and will honor every tear shed for His sake.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">For what glory is it.</span>--A poetical and pagan-sounding word, not elsewhere found in the New Testament; in the Old Testament it corresponds to the word "fame," in <a href="/job/28-22.htm" title="Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.">Job 28:22</a>. The sense may be said to be slightly humorous. "If you make a blunder" (such is the meaning of "fault" here--it might include such things as the breaking of dishes), "and receive a buffet for it" (or a box on the ear--a common punishment of slaves for trifling faults), "and bear it with fortitude" (the <span class= "ital">meekness</span> of patience has no place in the word), "do you expect to be made the subject of an heroic or dithyrambic poem, to have your name resounded through the world and immortalised among posterity?" The "for" at the beginning of the clause explains why the writer added "suffering <span class= "ital">wrongfully</span>" at the end of the last.<p><span class= "bld">When ye do well, and suffer for it</span>.--It is a pity that the translators have limited St. Peter's meaning by the insertion of the last two words. It is unnecessary to understand the suffering to be directly <span class= "ital">provoked</span> by the well-doing. It would have done just as well to say, "when ye do well, and yet are ill-treated." The "froward" master makes his servants suffer without thinking what he makes them suffer for.<p><span class= "bld">This is acceptable with God.</span>--Timidity about St. Peter's theology has caused a difference between the rendering of the same word in two consecutive verses. It should be translated "thankworthy" here as well as above, and must be taken in precisely the same sense. Observe that the Apostle does not continue, "this <span class= "ital">is</span> glory," as we might have expected; a Christian is not supposed to care for such trash as fame. But a Christian may well care to win the <span class= "ital">thanks of God!</span> And such endurance of griefs for God's sake is now distinctly said to be "thankworthy with God"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from God's point of view. See <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;">2Thessalonians 1:6</a>, where, as here, it is assumed that the moral law is identical for God and for us, and that His principles and impulses of action are the same as those which He has implanted in us. "He will thank a man for it," says Archbishop Leighton, not a divine to favour the doctrine of human merit, but too honest a scholar to shrink from the meaning of words. Many things are strictly duty, and yet we do not expect to find them done, and are proportionably grateful when we see that they are done. And shall we, for the sake of a doctrinal thesis like that, "that man can deserve nothing at the hand of God," deny to God the possibility of enjoying one of the happiest exercises of love, the sense of gratitude?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what glory is it?</span> The word translated "glory" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), common in Greek poetry, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, first, "rumor, report;" then "fame, renown." <span class="cmt_word">If, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently</span>; literally, <span class="accented">if sinning and being buffeted</span>. The word translated "buffeted" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), used by St. Matthew and St. Mark in describing our Savior's sufferings, has a figurative meaning in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>. It is probably used literally here; blows were a common occurrence in the life of slaves. To be patient when suffering deserved punishment is often difficult, but it is no more than a simple duty; it would not be for the glory of religion. Christian slaves ought to do their duty to their masters, and not deserve punishment. <span class="cmt_word">But if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently</span>; literally, <span class="accented">but if doing well, and suffering</span>. The words "for it" are not in the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">This is acceptable with God</span>. If we read "for" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>), with some of the best manuscripts, we must supply "there is glory" after the last clause. "It, doing well and suffering, ye take it patiently, there is glory (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), for this is thank-worthy (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) with God." Such conduct will bring honor to Christianity, for it is thankworthy even in the sight of God. When Christian men and women took cruel sufferings patiently and joyfully, as the apostles did (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>; <a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>), that was more than a mere recognized duty - that showed the power of Christian motives, that brought glory to Christianity, and was held to be thankworthy (such is God's gracious condescension) even in the sight of God. The word for "acceptable" here is that translated "thankworthy" in ver. 19, where see note. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(poion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4169.htm">Strong's 4169: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of what sort.
