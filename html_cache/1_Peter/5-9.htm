The concept of resistance implies a struggle or battle, echoing <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-13</a>, where Paul instructs believers to put on the full armor of God to stand against the devil's schemes. The idea of resistance is not passive but requires vigilance and strength, as seen in <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>, which also encourages believers to resist the devil, promising that he will flee from them. The call to resist is rooted in the understanding that the devil is a real adversary, as described in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where he is likened to a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.<p><b>Standing firm in your faith</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of a steadfast faith as the foundation for resisting the devil. The imagery of standing firm suggests stability and immovability, akin to the wise man who built his house on the rock in <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>. Faith here is not merely intellectual assent but a deep trust and reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, which recounts the faith of the patriarchs. The call to stand firm is a reminder of the believer's identity in Christ and the power available through the Holy Spirit, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-17</a>.<p><b>And in the knowledge that your brothers throughout the world</b><br>This phrase highlights the global nature of the Christian community. The early church was spread across the Roman Empire, and believers faced persecution in various regions, as seen in Acts and the epistles. The mention of "brothers" underscores the familial bond among Christians, a theme prevalent in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>, which speaks of believers as members of one body. The awareness of a shared struggle fosters solidarity and encouragement, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>, which urges believers to encourage one another.<p><b>Are undergoing the same kinds of suffering</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the universal experience of suffering among Christians. The early church faced persecution from both Jewish and Roman authorities, as documented in historical records and the book of Acts. The reference to "the same kinds of suffering" suggests that trials are a common part of the Christian experience, as Jesus foretold in <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>. This suffering is not without purpose, as it refines faith, similar to the testing of gold, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>. The shared experience of suffering serves to unite believers and remind them of their hope in Christ, who also suffered and overcame, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21-24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who authored this epistle, providing guidance and encouragement to early Christians facing persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>Referred to in the preceding verse as the adversary who prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christians.htm">Early Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, who were experiencing trials and persecution for their faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to the global community of believers who are enduring similar sufferings and trials.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/faith.htm">Faith</a></b><br>The steadfast belief and trust in God that believers are encouraged to maintain in the face of adversity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/resist_the_devil.htm">Resist the Devil</a></b><br>Understand that resistance is an active stance.

Realizing that believers everywhere face comparable pressures encourages perseverance and solidarity. The verse turns suffering from a cause for despair into a rallying point for steadfast, hope-filled resistance grounded in Christ&#8217;s ultimate victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Whom resist stedfast in the faith.</span>--The expression is somewhat more picturesque in the Greek than in the English. "Stand and face him," instead of running away from posts of duty (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>), or lying still and letting things take their course (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>). And the words for "stedfast in the faith" seem to mean not only that each individual is to stand firm, but that they are to present all together a solid front to the lion.<p><span class= "bld">Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</span>--The phraseology of the original is very strange. The <span class= "ital">sameness</span> of the sufferings is brought out by an expression which literally runs "the same things in the way of sufferings;" the fraternal unity, by the use of the same abstract word which we had in <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>. The verb rendered "to accomplish" sometimes denotes execution or infliction. So the whole will run, <span class= "ital">knowing that the very same things in the way of sufferings are being inflicted upon your brotherhood which is in the world. "</span>There is one thing," says Archbishop Leighton, "that much troubles the patience and weakens the faith of some Christians; they are ready to think there is none, yea, there was never any beloved of God in such a condition as theirs. Therefore the Apostle St. Paul breaks this conceit (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1Corinthians 10:13</a>), 'no temptation hath taken you but such as is common to man:' and here is the same truth, 'the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren.' This is the truth, and, taken altogether, is a most comfortable truth; the whole brotherhood go in this way, and our eldest Brother went first." The addition, "that are in the world," points the suffering Christians indirectly to solace themselves with the thought of that portion of the brotherhood which has got beyond the infliction. It would be possible to translate, though somewhat far-fetched in point of thought, "knowing that the same sufferings (or, <span class= "ital">the identity of the sufferings</span>) is completed by your brotherhood in the world"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>finds a consummation in making closer the bonds of brotherhood between you.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom resist steadfast in the faith</span>; comp. <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>, where the same word, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is used; the close resemblance seems to indicate St. Peter's knowledge of the Epistle of St. James; comp. also St. Paul in <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, etc. The Greek word for "steadfast" <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> is emphatic; it implies solidity, rocklike firmness. Only faith can give that steadfastness - faith in Christ, the one Foundation, the Rock on which the Christian's house is built. Faith here is trustfulness rather than objective truth. Therefore the rendering of the Revised Version seems preferable, "in your faith," the article having, as often, a possessive meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the same</span> (<span class="accented">forms</span>) <span class="accented">of afflictions</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> unusual construction with the pronoun, though common with adjectives, intended to give emphasis; the sufferings were the very same. The infinitive is present; it should therefore be rendered, "are being accomplished." The persecutions were now beginning to break out. The word for "brethren" is the collective, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1fef;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, brotherhood, which we met with in <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>. The dative is that of reference - "in" or "for" the brotherhood. (For the words, "in the world," comp. <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.") There is another way of taking the clause. The unusual construction (in the Greek Testament) of the accusative and infinitive, which, indeed, occurs nowhere else with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, has led Herman and others to take the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as middle, and to connect the dative, "<span class="accented">for</span> the brotherhood," with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, the same. Thus the translation will be, "<span class="accented">Knowing</span> how to pay the same tribute of affliction as your brethren in the world." This seems forced and unnecessary. Huther gives another possible translation, which he thinks preferable to all others: "<span class="accented">Knowing</span> [or better rather, 'considering'] that the same sufferings are accomplishing themselves in the brethren." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Resist</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(antist&#275;te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_436.htm">Strong's 436: </a> </span><span class="str2">To set against; I withstand, resist, oppose.
