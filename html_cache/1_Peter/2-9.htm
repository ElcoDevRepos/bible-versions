This echoes the Old Testament idea of Israel as God's chosen nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The term "chosen" signifies God's initiative in salvation and His sovereign grace. It highlights the continuity between the Old and New Covenants, where the church is seen as the spiritual Israel (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>).<p><b>a royal priesthood</b><br>This phrase combines the roles of royalty and priesthood, indicating that believers have direct access to God and are called to serve Him. It reflects <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, where Israel was called a kingdom of priests. The priesthood of all believers is a key New Testament teaching, emphasizing that through Christ, all have access to God (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). This also points to the believer's role in interceding for others and offering spiritual sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>a holy nation</b><br>The term "holy" means set apart for God's purposes. This phrase underscores the collective identity of believers as a distinct community, separate from the world. It draws from the covenant language of the Old Testament, where Israel was called to be holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). The church is called to reflect God's holiness in its conduct and mission (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>).<p><b>a people for God&#8217;s own possession</b><br>This phrase indicates a special relationship between God and His people, reminiscent of the covenant relationship with Israel (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). It signifies ownership and protection, where believers are treasured by God. This concept is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are described as being bought with a price (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>), highlighting the sacrificial work of Christ.<p><b>to proclaim the virtues of Him</b><br>Believers are called to declare the excellencies or virtues of God, which include His attributes and mighty works. This is a call to evangelism and worship, reflecting the believer's response to God's grace. The proclamation of God's virtues is a central theme in the Psalms and is fulfilled in the church's mission (<a href="/psalms/96-3.htm">Psalm 96:3</a>).<p><b>who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light</b><br>This phrase describes the transformative power of salvation, moving from spiritual darkness to light. Darkness symbolizes ignorance and sin, while light represents truth and holiness. This imagery is prevalent in Scripture, with Jesus being the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The calling out of darkness is a fulfillment of prophetic themes, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, and signifies the new life and understanding believers receive in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

The pronoun "ye" is emphatic. St. Peter is drawing a contrast between the disobedient and unbelieving Jews and Christian people whether Jews or Gentiles; he ascribes to Christians, in a series of phrases quoted from the Old Testament, the various privileges which had belonged to the children of Israel. The words, "a chosen generation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>), are from <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Cornerstone is elect, precious; the living stones built thereupon are elect likewise. The whole Christian Church is addressed as an elect race, one race, because all its members are begotten again of the one Father. <span class="cmt_word">A royal priesthood</span>. Instead of "holy," as in ver. 5, St. Peter has here the epithet "royal." He follows the Septuagint Version of <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; the Hebrew has "a kingdom of priests." The word "royal" may mean that God's elect shall sit with Christ in his throne, and reign with him (<a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>), and that in some sense they reign with him now over their lower nature, their desires and appetites; or, more probably, the priesthood of Christians is called "royal" because it belongs to the King - "a priesthood serving Jehovah the King, just as we speak of 'the royal household'" (Weiss, quoted by Huther). <span class="cmt_word">An holy nation.</span> Also from <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>. The Israelites were a holy nation as separated from the heathen and consecrated to God's service by circumcision.

The literal meaning of the Greek words used by St. Peter is "a people for acquisition," or "for keeping safe," the verb having the sense of "gaining, acquiring," and also that of "preserving, keeping for one's self" (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>; also <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, "The Church of God, which he purchased (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) with his own blood"). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should show forth the praises of him.</span> That ye should tell out, publish abroad. The verb is found nowhere else in the New Testament. The word translated "praises" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "virtues"), so very common in classical writers, occurs in the New Testament only here, <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3, 5</a>, and <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>. Here St. Peter is quoting from the Septuagint Version of <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm">Isaiah 43:21</a> (the word is similarly used in <a href="/isaiah/42-12.htm">Isaiah 42:12</a> and Isaiah 63:7).
