In biblical context, faith is often tested to demonstrate its authenticity and strength, similar to how metals are tested for purity. <a href="/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3-4</a> speaks of the testing of faith producing perseverance. The idea of proving character is rooted in the Old Testament, where figures like Abraham (Genesis 22) were tested to reveal their faithfulness to God. The Greek word for "proven character" implies a process of examination and approval, suggesting that trials serve a divine purpose in refining believers.<p><b>more precious than gold</b><br>Gold, in ancient times, was considered one of the most valuable and enduring materials. However, the text asserts that faith, once proven, holds even greater value. This comparison highlights the eternal significance of faith over material wealth. In <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, Jesus teaches about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth, reinforcing the idea that spiritual wealth surpasses earthly riches. The metaphor of gold also connects to the purification process, where impurities are removed, symbolizing the sanctification of believers.<p><b>which perishes even though refined by fire</b><br>Gold, despite its value and durability, is ultimately perishable. The refining process involves intense heat to purify the metal, analogous to the trials believers face. This imagery is used throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>, where God is described as a refiner and purifier of silver. The temporary nature of gold contrasts with the eternal nature of faith, underscoring the transient nature of earthly possessions and the enduring quality of spiritual virtues.<p><b>may result in praise, glory, and honor</b><br>The outcome of tested faith is described as resulting in praise, glory, and honor. These terms are often associated with divine reward and recognition. In <a href="/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>, Paul speaks of seeking glory, honor, and immortality through perseverance in doing good. The ultimate reward for believers is not earthly acclaim but divine commendation. This phrase suggests that enduring faith will be acknowledged and celebrated in the presence of God.<p><b>at the revelation of Jesus Christ</b><br>This phrase points to the eschatological hope of Christians&#8212;the second coming of Christ. The "revelation" refers to the unveiling or appearing of Jesus, as described in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>. This future event is a central theme in Christian eschatology, where believers anticipate the fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of His kingdom. The anticipation of Christ's return serves as motivation for enduring trials, as it promises ultimate vindication and reward for the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle of Jesus Christ, traditionally believed to be the author of this epistle.

"Faith" seems to mean the same as in <a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1Peter 1:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Being much more precious than of gold.</span>--There is no reason, or indeed any grammatical right, to insert the "of." It should be, <span class= "ital">more exceedingly valuable than gold.</span> He does not say "your <span class= "ital">faith</span> is more valuable than gold," but "your faith's <span class= "ital">genuineness</span> is more valuable than gold." It is worth anything to establish the <span class= "ital">true character</span> of your faith; it would be a most serious loss to leave a chance of an imputation upon your Christianity.<p><span class= "bld">That perisheth, though it be tried with fire.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">which is a thing that perisheth, and yet is tried through fire.</span> The argument is this. Gold is a perishable thing, and comes to an end with the rest of the world, or is worn away with handling and is lost; and yet men take great pains to test it and show that it contains no dross, and do so by means of fire. How much more may we expect a fiery trial (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm" title="Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:">1Peter 4:12</a>) to test the character of our belief in the unseen Christ, when that belief is never to come to an end (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1Corinthians 13:13</a>), and on its freedom from alloy everything depends! . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the trial of your faith.</span> The words of ver. 6, "if need be," point to the purpose and end of the temptations. St. Peter proceeds to develop his meaning. The word rendered "trial" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) means rather "test or proof;" it is explained by Dionysius of Halicarnassus ('Rhet.,' I1) as that at which, when one looks, he is able to form a judgment. Cremer says it is "not only the means of proof itself, e.g. the touchstone, but also the trace of the metal left thereon. Hence here and in <a href="/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> is the result of the contact of faith with temptations, that in virtue of which faith is recognized as genuine - the verification of faith." Dr. Heft ('Notes on Select Readings') prefers the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which is given by two of the better cursives. He says, "<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the instrument of trial, not even the process of trial, much less the thing fried; while it is only the thing tried that can be compared, as here, to gold refined in the fire." Compare the use of the cognate word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-9.htm">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>; <a href="/romans/5-4.htm">Romans 5:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>. Being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">more precious than gold</span>. Gold is the most precious of metals, faith is more precious far; the proof of faith is more momentous beyond all comparison than the proof of gold. Gold perishes; "Consumitur annulus usu," says the poet; "Aurum cummundo perit," says Bengel; but "Now abideth faith, hope, charity," says the apostle. Gold is tried with fire; as by the purifying fire gold is purged of dross (<a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>), so by the refining fire of temptations the faithful are cleansed from pride and self-reliance and the pollutions of sin.
