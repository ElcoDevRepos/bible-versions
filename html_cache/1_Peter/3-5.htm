These women, such as Sarah, Rebekah, and Ruth, are seen as models of virtue and piety. The concept of "adorning" here is not about external beauty but about inner qualities that reflect a heart devoted to God. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God values the heart over outward appearance. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on physical adornment, but these women are commended for their spiritual adornment, which is timeless and transcends cultural norms.<p><b>They put their hope in God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the foundation of their character and actions: trust in God. In a historical context, these women lived in patriarchal societies where their security and status were often tied to their husbands or male relatives. Despite this, their ultimate hope and trust were in God, not in human institutions or relationships. This mirrors the faith of figures like Hannah, who prayed earnestly to God for a child, demonstrating her reliance on Him (<a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10-11</a>). Theologically, this hope in God is a precursor to the New Testament teaching of faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, which commends the faith of Old Testament figures.<p><b>and were submissive to their husbands,</b><br>Submission in this context is often misunderstood in modern times. Biblically, it reflects a voluntary and respectful yielding to the leadership of one's husband, as seen in the relationship between Sarah and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>). This submission is not about inferiority but about order and harmony within the family unit, as outlined in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>. The cultural context of the time viewed the family as a microcosm of society, with clear roles and responsibilities. This submission is also a type of Christ's submission to the Father, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where Jesus willingly submits to God's will, demonstrating

class="vheading2">What Does 1 Peter 3:5 Mean</div><b>For this is how</b><p>Peter is pointing back to verses 3-4, where he contrasts external adornment with &#8220;the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit.&#8221; By saying &#8220;this is how,&#8221; he roots the instruction in a proven pattern, not a new idea. The standard for Christian wives is the same timeless model that shaped the faith of believers before us (see <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>). It is an appeal to continuity: what pleased God then still pleases Him now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the holy women of the past</b><p>These are the God-fearing wives recorded in Scripture&#8212;Sarah, Rebekah, Ruth, Hannah, and others whose stories fill Genesis through 1 Samuel. Their lives were set apart (&#8220;holy&#8221;) because they walked in covenant with the Lord (<a href="/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>). By highlighting these women, Peter holds up a lineage of faith for Christian wives to join today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>adorned themselves</b><p>Peter has already said, &#8220;Let your adornment not be external... but the hidden person of the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>). The word &#8220;adorned&#8221; pictures deliberate preparation&#8212;like putting on a garment. For these women, true beauty flowed from character shaped by God rather than jewelry, hairstyles, or clothing (<a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9-10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-25.htm">Proverbs 31:25, 30</a>).<p>Practical takeaway:<p>&#8226; Spend time &#8220;dressing the heart&#8221; through Scripture and prayer before dressing the body.<p>&#8226; Let kindness, humility, and peace be as noticeable as a new outfit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They put their hope in God</b><p>Hope was the source of their inner beauty. Trusting the Lord freed them from fear and resentment, enabling them to live with calm confidence (<a href="/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3-4</a>).

It is not servility or silence but a recognition of the husband&#8217;s God-given headship (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>). These &#8220;holy women&#8221; demonstrated:<p>&#8226; Respectful attitudes&#8212;Sarah called Abraham &#8220;lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Courageous partnership&#8212;submission did not prevent Esther from speaking up for her people.<p>&#8226; Active faith&#8212;obedience to God first, which sometimes guided the husband (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>).<p>Submission, anchored in hope, becomes a powerful witness, drawing even unbelieving husbands &#8220;without a word&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5</a> reminds wives that authentic beauty is spiritual, not cosmetic. Like the godly women who came before, Christian wives cultivate inner adornment by trusting God and willingly embracing the order He established in marriage. Hope fuels obedience; obedience showcases hope. In every generation, this quiet but radiant testimony glorifies Christ and blesses the home.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">For after this manner.</span>--Here we have not only <span class= "ital">the</span> ground of the foregoing precepts, but also of the assurance that God sets a value on such embellishments. It had been accepted by Him in the holy women of old who hoped in Him, and would be accepted again. "The Apostle enforces his doctrine by example," says Leighton: "the most compendious way of teaching." By "holy women" he means, not only holy in character, but "sainted"--consecrated by their memories being recorded for our reverence in Holy Writ.<p><span class= "bld">Who trusted in God.</span>--It is a great pity that "trusted" should have been substituted for the original "hoped." The position of Sara and the holy women of the Old Testament was one of <span class= "ital">expectancy, </span>of looking <span class= "ital">forward</span> to the fulfilment of a promise; and the description of them as such is intended to make the readers of the letter feel the difference of <span class= "ital">their</span> position. To <span class= "ital">them</span> the promise to Sara was accomplished. The expression contains a reference to the mention of God in the last verse.<p><span class= "bld">Adorned themselves, being in subjection.</span>--The imperfect tense of the verb means "<span class= "ital">used</span> to adorn themselves." They took daily pains thus to adorn themselves, and spent, perhaps, as long in the process as the other ladies over their toilette. The participle which is added explains more fully the "after this manner." Their subjection was their ornament.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God;</span> rather, <span class="accented">who hoped in God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); whose hope was set toward God and rested in God. Bengel says," Vera sanctitas, spes in Deum." St. Peter is the apostle of hope. <span class="cmt_word">Adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands.</span> The apostle bids Christian women to consider the example of the saintly women of the Old Testament. With their hope resting upon God, they could not care for finery and costly jewels. They adorned themselves with the more costly ornament of a meek and quiet spirit: they showed their meekness by living in subjection to their husbands.
