This term "elder" (Greek: presbyteros) was used in Jewish communities and early Christian churches to denote leaders who were responsible for teaching, governance, and pastoral care. Peter's use of "fellow" underscores humility and solidarity, rather than asserting apostolic authority over them. This reflects the early church's structure, where leadership was shared among a group of elders rather than centralized in a single figure.<p><b>a witness of Christ&#8217;s sufferings</b><br>Peter claims firsthand experience of Christ's sufferings, likely referring to his presence during Jesus' ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection. This personal witness lends authority to his message and connects him to the core events of the Gospel. It also fulfills the role of an apostle as one who has seen the risen Christ (<a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21-22</a>). Peter's witness is not just historical but theological, as he interprets Christ's sufferings as central to salvation and a model for Christian endurance (<a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>).<p><b>and a partaker of the glory to be revealed</b><br>Peter speaks of sharing in the future glory, pointing to the eschatological hope of believers. This glory is associated with Christ's return and the final establishment of His kingdom (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17-18</a>). The phrase suggests both present participation in Christ's life through suffering and future participation in His glory. This dual aspect of suffering and glory is a recurring theme in Peter's writings, encouraging believers to remain steadfast in trials with the assurance of future reward.<p><b>I appeal to the elders among you</b><br>Peter's appeal is a call to action and responsibility for the church leaders. The use of "appeal" rather than command indicates a tone of encouragement and exhortation. The elders are urged to shepherd the flock with diligence and care, reflecting the pastoral heart of the early church. This appeal is consistent with the biblical model of leadership as service, as exemplified by Christ (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>). The context suggests a time of persecution or trial, where strong and compassionate leadership is crucial for the community's endurance and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The author of the letter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, who identifies himself as a fellow elder and a witness to Christ's sufferings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>Leaders within the early Christian communities to whom Peter is addressing his exhortation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_sufferings.htm">Christ&#8217;s Sufferings</a></b><br>Refers to the events of Jesus' passion, crucifixion, and the trials He endured, which Peter witnessed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/glory_to_be_revealed.htm">Glory to be Revealed</a></b><br>The future hope and promise of eternal glory with Christ, which Peter and all believers anticipate.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, likely scattered across Asia Minor, facing various trials and persecutions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_in_humility.htm">Leadership in Humility</a></b><br>Peter identifies himself as a "fellow elder," emphasizing humility and equality among church leaders.

The laity, on the other hand, are to observe discipline. Indeed, mutual submission is the only safe-guard in the face of a common danger. An unbroken front must be presented, and the sense of brotherhood fostered.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The elders which are among you . . .</span>--The best text preserves the word "therefore" after "elders." In view, that is, of these hopes and threats, of the present persecution, and of the coming judgment, St. Peter gives his solemn charge to those who shared with him the responsibility of office in the Church. The word rendered "exhort" is that common New Testament word (<span class= "ital">parakalo</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which we miss in English, including encouragement and entreaty, and even consolation, as well as exhortation. (See, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/acts/4-36.htm" title="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,">Acts 4:36</a>,) The whole of this Epistle is an example of such <span class= "ital">paraclesis.</span><p><span class= "bld">Who am also an elder.</span>--St. Peter is giving no irresponsible advice. He knows by experience the dangers which beset the office. The head Christian of the world, and writing from the thick of the persecution already begun in Rome, the Asiatic elders cannot set his advice down as that of some easy layman who is untouched by the difficulty. It can hardly be said, therefore, that this is an example of St. Peter's <span class= "ital">humility, </span>as though he recognised in himself no higher office than that of these presbyters. The effect is, on the contrary, to make the recipients of the Letter feel that he is using a strong argument <span class= "ital">a fortiori.</span><p><span class= "bld">And a witness of the sufferings of Christ.</span>--The Greek word calls attention, not so much to the fact of his having been a <span class= "ital">spectator, </span>an eye-witness, but rather to the fact of his bearing <span class= "ital">testimony</span> to the sufferings. Here again, too, it is in Greek "the sufferings of <span class= "ital">the</span> Christ." (See Note on <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1Peter 1:11</a>.) Not only did St. Peter know, by bearing office himself, what the dangers of office were, but he was able to testify how the Messiah Himself, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, had suffered, from which it was natural to conclude that all Christians also were destined to suffer.<p><span class= "bld">And also a partaker of the glory . . .</span>--This splendid assurance follows naturally from being a witness of the sufferings of the Christ. "I am in as much danger as any of you," the Apostle says, "but I can testify that the Christ Himself suffered thus, and therefore I knew that we who suffer with Him are even now partakers of the glory, though a veil at present hides. it." St. Peter insists in the same way on our <span class= "ital">present</span> possession of what will not be <span class= "ital">shown</span> us for a time in <a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1Peter 1:5</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The elders which are among you I exhort.</span> The Vatican and Alexandrine Manuscripts omit the article, and insert "therefore" (the Sinaitic gives both), reading, "Elders, therefore, among you I exhort." The solemn thoughts of the last chapter, the coming judgment, the approach of persecution, the necessity of perseverance in well-doing, suggest the exhortation; hence the "therefore." The context shows that the apostle is using the word "elder" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, presbyter) in its official sense, though its original meaning was also in his thoughts, as appears by ver. 5. We first meet with the word in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16, 18</a>; <a href="/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>, etc.). Used originally with reference to age, it soon became a designation of office. Very early in the history of the Christian Church we meet with the same title. It occurs first in <a href="/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>. The Christians of Antioch make a collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, and send their alms by the hand of Barnabas and Saul to the elders of the Jerusalem Church. We read several times of these elders in Acts xv. as associated with the apostles in the consideration of the great question of the circumcision of Gentile Christians; they joined with St. James in the official reception of St. Paul at his last visit to Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>). It appears, then, that the Christian presbyterate originated in the mother Church of Jerusalem. It was soon introduced into the daughter Churches; the apostles Paul and Barnabas ordained elders in every Church during the first missionary journey (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>); and the various notices scattered over the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles imply the early establishment of the office throughout the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Who am also an elder</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Peter, though holding the very highest rank in the Church as an apostle of Christ, one of those who were to sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>), claims no supremacy; he simply designates himself as a brother presbyter. So also St. John (<a href="/2_john/1.htm">2 John 1</a>; <a href="/3_john/1.htm">3 John 1</a>). He exhorts the presbyters as a brother, and grounds his exhortation on community of office. The absence of any note of distinction between bishops and presbyters is, so far, an indication of the early date of this Epistle, as against Hilgenfeld and others. <span class="cmt_word">And a witness of the sufferings of Christ.</span> This was his one distinction above those whom he addresses. Like St. John, he declared unto them that which he had heard, which he had seen with his eyes. He had seen the Lord bound and delivered into the hands of wicked men; probably he had watched his last sufferings among them which stood afar off. <span class="cmt_word">And also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.</span> The thought of the sufferings of Christ leads on to the thought of the future glory (comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>). Perhaps St. Peter was also thinking of the Lord's promise to himself, "Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards" (<a href="/john/13-36.htm">John 13:36</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[As]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
