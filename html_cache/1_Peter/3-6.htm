In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, the term "lord" was a common expression of respect and acknowledgment of authority within the household. Sarah's obedience to Abraham is highlighted as an example of a godly relationship, where mutual respect and submission are practiced. This relationship is not about subjugation but about honoring God's design for marriage. Sarah's faith and trust in God's promises, despite her initial doubts, are seen as exemplary. Her obedience is also a type of the church's submission to Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>.<p><b>And you are her children if you do what is right</b><br>Being called "her children" signifies a spiritual lineage rather than a physical one. It implies that believers who emulate Sarah's faith and obedience are considered her spiritual descendants. Doing "what is right" involves living a life of righteousness, characterized by faith, obedience, and trust in God. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of faith being demonstrated through actions, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>. The call to do what is right is a reminder of the ethical and moral standards expected of believers, reflecting the holiness of God.<p><b>and refuse to give way to fear</b><br>This phrase encourages believers to stand firm in their faith without succumbing to fear. In the historical context, early Christians faced persecution and social ostracism, which could lead to fear and anxiety. The exhortation to refuse fear is a call to trust in God's sovereignty and protection, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>. Fear can be a barrier to obedience and faithfulness, and overcoming it is essential for spiritual growth. This echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>, where believers are reminded that God has given them a spirit of power, love, and self-discipline, not of fear.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>The wife of Abraham, known for her faith and obedience.

St. Peter seems rather to have argued from what every one would feel <span class= "ital">must</span> have been the case than from explicit records. Sara's usual subjection is clearly seen in the one instance to which St. Peter refers (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>), where Sara, though not addressing Abraham, but speaking to herself, calls him "my lord." People show their usual habits of mind more freely in speaking to themselves.<p><span class= "bld">Whose daughters ye are.</span>--A very misleading version, following the Vulgate. What St. Peter says is, <span class= "ital">whose children ye became, </span>or <span class= "ital">were made.</span> There was a definite period in their past lives at which they came to be--what they were not before--children of Sara. Have we not here, therefore, a distinct proof that these readers of the Epistle were Gentiles and not Jewesses? Not so. The phrase, "which hoped in God," pointing as it does to the coming of the Messiah, prepares us to understand how these Hebrew women <span class= "ital">became</span> Sara's children. It was only by entering into her hope and attaching themselves to Jesus Christ, for whose coming she had looked. St. Peter has already been insisting on the nothingness of the fleshly descent, the "corruptible seed." As has been pointed out on <a href="/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:">1Peter 1:24</a>, this doctrine was not first taught by St. Paul, for St. Peter had heard it from the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>) and from our Lord Himself (<a href="/john/8-39.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.">John 8:39</a>). Whether persons were naturally Jews or Gentiles, they could not be children of Abraham without voluntarily becoming so by embracing his principles--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by becoming Christians. The participial clauses which follow will need no change of translation, for they express not the act or process by which these ladies <span class= "ital">became</span> children of Sara, but the condition on which they would <span class= "ital">remain</span> her children. A very similar passage occurs in <a href="/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a> : "We have become partakers of the Christ, if (for the future) we hold," &c. (Comp. also <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.">1Thessalonians 3:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord</span>. St. Peter singles out Sarah, as the mother of the chosen people. She obeyed her husband habitually (the imperfect <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is the reading of some of the oldest manuscripts; the aorist, also well supported, would represent her obedience as a whole, the character of her life now past); she called him lord (comp. <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.) <span class="cmt_word">Whose daughters ye are</span>; literally, w<span class="accented">hose children ye became.</span> This is another indication that the Epistle is addressed, not only to Jewish Christians, but also, and that in large measure, to Gentile converts. Gentile women became by faith the daughters of Sarah; just as we read in St. Paul's Epistles that "they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham" (<a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>); and that Abraham is "the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised" (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>); comp. <a href="/galatians/4-22.htm">Galatians 4:22-31</a>, where St. Paul tells us that we, like Isaac, are the children of promise; children, "not of the bondwoman, but of the free." <span class="cmt_word">As long as ye do well</span>. This clause represents one Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("doing good"). Some commentators regard the words from "even as Sara" to "whose daughters ye are" as a parenthesis, and refer the participle to "the holy women" mentioned in ver. 5. This does not seem natural. It is better to regard the second half of this verse as a continuous sentence, and to understand the participle as meaning "if ye do well." The doing well, etc., is a mark that Christian women have become children of Sarah by faith. <span class="cmt_word">And are not afraid with any amazement</span>. The Greek word for "amazement" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) does not occur in any other place of the New Testament, though we meet with the corresponding verb in <a href="/luke/21-9.htm">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>:87. There seems to be a reference to <a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>, "Be not afraid of sudden fear ' (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is "dismay, scared terrified excitement," very different from the calm thoughtful <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the fear lest they should fail in proper respect for their husbands, and that out of the holy fear of God, which St. Peter inculcates upon wives (ver. 2). The Christian wife might often experience cruel treatment from an unbelieving husband, but she was not to live in a flutter of excited terror; she was to be calm and quiet, trusting in God. As to the construction, the accusative may be cognate, as the Authorized Version takes it; or the accusative of the object, as in <a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>. The last view is, perhaps, the -most suitable: "And are not afraid of any sudden terror." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">just as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Sarah</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#940;&#961;&#961;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Sarra)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4564.htm">Strong's 4564: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sarah, wife of Abraham.
