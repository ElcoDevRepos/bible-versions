The Gospels detail how Jesus was mocked, spat upon, and insulted by both the Roman soldiers and Jewish leaders (<a href="/matthew/27-27.htm">Matthew 27:27-31</a>, <a href="/mark/15-16.htm">Mark 15:16-20</a>). This abuse fulfilled Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which foretold the Messiah would be "despised and rejected by men." The cultural context of the time allowed for such treatment of those considered criminals or blasphemers, highlighting the depth of humiliation Jesus willingly faced.<p><b>He did not retaliate</b><br>Jesus' response to abuse was one of non-retaliation, embodying the teachings He gave in the Sermon on the Mount about turning the other cheek (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>). This restraint is a demonstration of His divine nature and fulfillment of prophecy, as <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a> describes the suffering servant as silent before His accusers. Jesus' example sets a standard for Christian conduct, emphasizing forgiveness and trust in God's justice over personal vengeance.<p><b>when He suffered</b><br>The suffering of Jesus was both physical and spiritual, encompassing the agony of crucifixion and the weight of bearing humanity's sins. This suffering was prophesied in passages like <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describe the Messiah's afflictions. Historically, crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most severe criminals, underscoring the extent of Jesus' humiliation and pain. His suffering is central to Christian theology, as it is through His wounds that believers find healing (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p><b>He made no threats</b><br>Despite the injustice and pain, Jesus refrained from threatening His persecutors. This restraint is a testament to His character and mission, aligning with His role as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). His silence in the face of suffering is a powerful example of meekness and submission to God's will, contrasting with the human tendency to seek retribution.<p><b>but entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly</b><br>Jesus' trust in God the Father is evident here, as He committed His spirit into God's hands (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>). This act of entrusting Himself to divine justice reflects His faith in God's righteous judgment and ultimate plan. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> and <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, which affirm that vengeance belongs to the Lord.

And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?">John 8:46</a>), it did not make Him retaliate upon His accusers by counter-accusations, true though these might have been. The word here translated "revile" is the same which reappears in <a href="/1_peter/3-9.htm" title="Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing.">1Peter 3:9</a> as "railing," and a sample of what it means is given in <a href="/john/9-28.htm" title="Then they reviled him, and said, You are his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.">John 9:28</a>. The servants would be particularly liable to be thus abused, and instances are not wanting in the comic poets where they lose their self-control under it, and openly rate their owners in return. The "suffering," on the other hand, implies actual bodily maltreatment, "buffeting" (<a href="/1_peter/2-20.htm" title="For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.">1Peter 2:20</a>) and the like, to which the slaves could not answer directly by striking in return, but would sometimes take their revenge by "threats" of what they would do--run away, or burn the house, or poison the food, or do little acts of spite. Instances of our Lord's silence or meekness under "reviling" may be seen in <a href="/john/7-20.htm" title="The people answered and said, You have a devil: who goes about to kill you?">John 7:20</a>; <a href="/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24</a>, as well as in the accounts of the Passion. There are no recorded instances, until the last day of His life, of His "suffering" in the sense here intended; but the tense of the verbs "reviled," "threatened," "committed," shows that the writer was not thinking exclusively of any one occasion, but of our Lord's constant habit, though naturally there would be uppermost in St. Peter's mind the hours while he stood warming himself at Caiaphas' fire, with the denial on his lips, and saw the Messiah blindfold and buffeted. He is also thinking of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). The Lord again and again denounced the hypocrisy and unbelief of the Pharisees; he bade Caiaphas remember the coming judgment. But that was the language of prophetic warning, the sternness of love. He sets before them the impending punishment, that they may take heed in time and escape from the wrath to come. In the midst of his strongest invective against the sins and hollow unreality of Pharisaism there is an outburst of the deepest love, the tenderest concern (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). But committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. The verb "committed" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) is without an object in the original. Most commentators supply "himself," or "his cause;" others, "his sufferings;" some, as Alford, "those who inflicted them." Perhaps the last explanation is the best: he left them to God, to God's mercy, if it might be; to his judgment, if it must be. There may be a reference to his prayer, "Father, forgive them." Compare by contrast the language of Jeremiah, speaking in the spirit of the Old Testament (<a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a> and Jeremiah 20:12).
