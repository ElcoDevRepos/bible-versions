In the Old Testament, the sacrificial system required repeated offerings for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>). Christ's suffering and death fulfilled and replaced these sacrifices, as He was the perfect and ultimate offering (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>). The phrase "once for all" underscores the completeness of His atonement, aligning with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who would bear the iniquities of many.<p><b>the righteous for the unrighteous</b><br>This highlights the substitutionary nature of Christ's atonement. Jesus, the sinless and righteous one (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), took the place of sinners, bearing the punishment that was rightfully theirs. This concept is rooted in the idea of a sacrificial lamb, as seen in the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>) and further explained in the New Testament (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The righteous suffering for the unrighteous is a profound demonstration of God's love and justice, fulfilling the law's demands while providing grace.<p><b>to bring you to God</b><br>The purpose of Christ's suffering and death was reconciliation between humanity and God. Sin had created a separation (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>), but through Jesus' sacrifice, believers are brought near to God (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>). This reconciliation is not just a legal standing but a restored relationship, allowing believers to have direct access to God (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). The imagery of the temple veil tearing at Christ's death (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) symbolizes this newfound access.<p><b>He was put to death in the body</b><br>This phrase affirms the physical reality of Christ's death. It counters early heresies that denied Jesus' humanity or the reality of His suffering. The crucifixion was a historical event, witnessed by many (<a href="/mark/15-39.htm">Mark 15:39</a>), and it fulfilled numerous prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The physical death of Jesus is essential for the atonement, as it was through His blood that redemption was accomplished (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p><b>but made alive in the Spirit</b><br>This speaks to the resurrection of Christ, a cornerstone of Christian faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>). While His body was put to death, He was resurrected by the power of the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>). This resurrection is a testament to His victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55-57</a>) and serves as a promise of eternal life for believers (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).

It has been tried before, and the precedent is encouraging. "It is," says Archbishop Leighton, "some known ease to the mind, in any distress, to look upon examples of the like or greater distress in present or former times . . . As the example and company of the saints in suffering is very considerable, so that of Christ is more than any other, yea, than all the rest together." If King Messiah (note that he does not call Him Jesus) could endure to be cut off (but not for Himself), was it for any one who clung to the promises to shrink from the like test?<p><span class= "bld">Hath once suffered.</span>--Even if we retain the verb, it should be <span class= "ital">suffered, </span>not "hath suffered," it is all past now; but much the better reading is <span class= "ital">died, </span>which leaves no doubt about the meaning of "suffering" in <a href="/1_peter/3-17.htm" title="For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.">1Peter 3:17</a>. And this He did "once." In this significant word St. Peter strikes out the main argument of a great portion of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm" title="And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:">Hebrews 9:27</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The thought that Christ suffered or died "once" conveys comfort to these Christians for several reasons: (1) because His death has, once for all, taken all terror from an innocent death; (2) because no Christian will have to die more than one death; (3) because one death, so soon over for ever, contains the further idea of happiness and peace beyond. The word "to die" in Greek is often used in a penal sense--"to be put to death"--and is to be so taken here.<p><span class= "bld">For sins.</span>--When the Apostle says "Christ <span class= "ital">also," </span>he raises a comparison between Christ and the Christian martyr. Now the parallel does not merely consist in the fact that both "suffer" or are put to death. Both are put to death but once. Both are put to death innocent: the martyr "while well-doing," Christ acknowledged to be "just." But this does not exhaust the likeness. The Messiah is said to be put to death "for sins." Now this expression "for sins" (literally, <span class= "ital">in connection with sins</span>) is that which is used to mean "as a sin-offering." (See <a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-6.htm" title="In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure.">Hebrews 10:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-8.htm" title="Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin you would not, neither had pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;">Hebrews 10:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm" title="Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.">Hebrews 10:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm" title="For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,">Hebrews 10:26</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm" title="For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.">Hebrews 13:11</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1John 4:10</a>.) If, therefore, "Christ <span class= "ital">also</span> was put to death as a sin-offering," it is implied that, in a sense, the Christian martyr is also a sin-offering, and (though in an infinitely lower degree) dies, like Him, "just for unjust." This is a fresh encouragement to St. Peter's first readers to meet death bravely. In what sense they can be sacrifices for other men's sins we shall consider presently. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because Christ also once suffered.</span> Two of the oldest manuscripts read "<span class="accented">died</span>;" but "suffered" corresponds best with the previous verse. The connection is - It must be better to suffer for well-doing, because Christ himself, the All-innocent One, thus suffered, and they who so suffer are made most like unto him. The apostle refers us again to that transcendent Example which was ever before his eyes (compare the close parallel in <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26-28</a>). Christ suffered once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>); so the sufferings of the Christian are soon over" but for a moment." <span class="accented">For sins</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>); concerning sins, on account of sins; he, himself sinless, suffered concerning the sins of others. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> is constantly used in connection with the sin offering in the Septuagint (see <a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; comp. <a href="/leviticus/5-8.htm">Leviticus 5:8-11</a>, etc.; also <a href="/hebrews/10-6.htm">Hebrews 10:6, 8, 18, 26</a>). The Just for the unjust; literally, <span class="accented">just for unjust.</span> There is no article. The apostle began to speak of the death of Christ, both here and in 1 Peter it., as an example; in both places he seems to be led on by an instinctive feeling that it is scarcely seemly for the Christian to mention that stupendous event without dwelling on its deeper and more mysterious meaning. The preposition used in this clause (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>) does not necessarily convey the idea of vicarious suffering, as <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; comp. also <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>) does; it means simply "in behalf of," leaving the character of the relation undetermined; here the context implies the particular relation of substitution (comp. <a href="/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>; also St. Peter's description of our Lord as "the Just," in <a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That he might bring us to</span> <span class="cmt_word">God.</span> The Vatican and other manuscripts read "you." St. Peter opens out one of the deeper aspects of the death of Christ. The veil that hid the Holiest was then rent in twain, and believers were invited and encouraged to draw near into the immediate presence of God. The verb used here is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; the corresponding substantive (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>) occurs in <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>; also in <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>. In those places it is rendered "access" - we have access to the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.</span> The Greeks words are, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, the article <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> inserted before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in the received text being without authority. We observe the absence of any article or preposition, and the exact balance and correspondence of the two clauses. The two datives must be taken in the same sense; it is impossible to regard one as the dative of the sphere, and the other as the dative of the instrument; both are evidently datives of "the sphere to which a general predicate is to be limited" (Winer, 31:6. a); they limit the extent of the participles (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-35.htm">1 Corinthians 7:35</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>). Thus the literal translation is, "Being put to death in flesh, but quickened in spirit." For the antithesis of "flesh" and "spirit," common in the New Testament, comp. <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3, 4</a>, "Made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness;" and <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, "Manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit;" see especially the close parallel in <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm">1 Peter 4:6</a>, "That they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." It seems to follow, from the opposition of flesh and spirit, and from a comparison of the passages quoted above, that by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in this verse we are to understand, not God the Holy Ghost, but the holy human spirit of Christ. In his flesh he was put to death, but in his spirit he was quickened. When the Lord had said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit;" when he bowed his head, and gave up the spirit; - then that spirit passed into a new life. So Bengel excellently says, "Christus, vitam in semet ipso habens, et ipse vita, spiritu vivere neque desiit, neque iterum coepit; sed simulatque per mortificationem involucre infirmitatis in carne solutus erat, <span class="accented">statim</span> vitae solvi nesciae virtus modis novis et multo expeditissimis sese exserere coepit." Christ, being delivered from the burden of that suffering flesh which he had graciously taken for our salvation, was quickened in his holy human spirit - quickened to new energies, new and blessed activities. So it shall be with those who suffer for well-doing; they may even be put to death in the flesh, but "if we die with him, we shall also live with him." It is far better (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to depart and to be with Christ, to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. They that are Christ's shall, like their Master, be quickened in the spirit; they pass at once into the new life of Paradise; their works follow them thither; it may be, we cannot tell, they will be employed in blessed work for Christ, being made like unto him not only in some degree during their earthly life, but also in the intermediate state of rest and hope. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/3-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Christ</span><br /><span class="grk">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Christos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5547.htm">Strong's 5547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Anointed One; the Messiah, the Christ.
