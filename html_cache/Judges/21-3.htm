The invocation of "O LORD God of Israel" emphasizes their recognition of God's sovereignty and covenant relationship with Israel. Historically, this cry is set in the period of the Judges, a time marked by moral and spiritual decline. The Israelites often turned to God in times of distress, as seen in <a href="/judges/6-7.htm">Judges 6:7</a> when they cried out to the LORD because of Midian. This pattern of crying out to God highlights their dependence on divine intervention despite their recurring disobedience.<p><b>&#8220;has this happened in Israel?&#8221;</b><br>The question underscores the gravity of the situation. The Israelites are bewildered by the internal conflict that has led to the near extinction of the tribe of Benjamin. This reflects the chaotic and lawless period described in <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes." The internal strife contrasts with the unity expected among the tribes of Israel, as seen in earlier biblical narratives like the conquest of Canaan under Joshua. The rhetorical nature of the question suggests a search for understanding and accountability, possibly hinting at the consequences of collective sin and disobedience.<p><b>Today in Israel one tribe is missing!&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights the immediate and severe consequence of the civil war against Benjamin. The loss of a tribe threatens the integrity and unity of the nation, which was meant to be a collective representation of God's chosen people. Theologically, the missing tribe signifies a breach in the covenant community, echoing the importance of each tribe in the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The absence of a tribe also foreshadows the future divisions and challenges Israel would face, such as the split into the northern and southern kingdoms. This moment serves as a somber reminder of the need for reconciliation and unity within the body of believers, a theme echoed in the New Testament's call for unity in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel who are lamenting the near extinction of the tribe of Benjamin due to a civil war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_benjamin.htm">The Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, which was nearly wiped out due to the conflict with the other tribes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>A place where the Israelites gathered to discuss the situation and seek the Lord's guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord,_god_of_israel.htm">The LORD, God of Israel</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whom the Israelites are addressing in their lament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/civil_war_in_israel.htm">Civil War in Israel</a></b><br>The internal conflict that led to the near destruction of the tribe of Benjamin, highlighting the moral and social chaos during the time of the Judges.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin_and_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Sin and Disobedience</a></b><br>The near extinction of the tribe of Benjamin serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of sin and disobedience to God&#8217;s laws.
