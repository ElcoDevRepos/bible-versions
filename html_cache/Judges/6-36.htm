This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel during the time of the Judges, where God directly intervened in the affairs of His people. Gideon's dialogue with God is reminiscent of other biblical figures like Moses and Abraham, who also communicated directly with God. This phrase sets the stage for Gideon's request for confirmation of God's will, highlighting his need for reassurance.<p><b>If You are going to save Israel by my hand</b><br>Gideon acknowledges God's power and sovereignty in delivering Israel, yet he seeks confirmation of his role in this divine plan. This reflects a common theme in the Bible where God uses unlikely individuals to accomplish His purposes, emphasizing that the true power and glory belong to God. Gideon's hesitance and need for assurance can be compared to Moses' reluctance in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3-4</a>. The phrase also foreshadows the deliverance that God will bring through Gideon, which is a type of the ultimate salvation brought by Jesus Christ.<p><b>as You have said</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of God's word and promises. Gideon is recalling God's previous assurance of victory over the Midianites, which is found earlier in <a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14-16</a>. It highlights the faithfulness of God to His promises, a recurring theme throughout Scripture. This reliance on God's word is a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of trusting in God's promises even when circumstances seem daunting. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant faithfulness to Israel, which is ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

He brings his uncertainty into conversation with the God who invited it (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The text reminds us that prayer is the first resort of faith-filled people, even when their faith feels fragile.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If You are going to save Israel</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8216;If You are going to save Israel&#8230;&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The focus is national deliverance. Gideon aligns with God&#8217;s announced plan to rescue His covenant people from Midianite oppression (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14</a>; 2:16).<p>&#8226; Salvation in Judges is concrete&#8212;freedom from enemy domination&#8212;yet it foreshadows the ultimate salvation God provides in Christ (<a href="/luke/1-71.htm">Luke 1:71</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Gideon&#8217;s &#8220;if&#8221; is not doubting God&#8217;s ability but seeking confirmation of timing and method. Similar conditional language appears in Moses&#8217; appeal (<a href="/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12-13</a>) and Jonathan&#8217;s faith venture (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse highlights God&#8217;s consistent pattern: He delights to save those who cannot save themselves (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By my hand</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8216;by my hand&#8230;&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Gideon recognizes personal responsibility.

Gideon&#8217;s desire is to obey accurately, not to avoid obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36</a> captures Gideon&#8217;s honest dialogue with God: he knows deliverance depends on the Lord, recognizes his own role, and seeks assurance rooted in God&#8217;s spoken promise. The verse models prayerful dependence, shows how divine salvation often works through human hands, and reaffirms that God&#8217;s word is utterly trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">If thou wilt save Israel.</span>--This diffidence and hesitation show the seriousness of the crisis. Gideon saw that by human strength alone he would be utterly helpless to repel the countless hosts of the marauders. He had already shown his faith, but now he needed fresh encouragement in his dangerous task.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt save</span>, etc. There is something touching in Gideon's diffidence of himself, even now that he found himself at the head of a large force. The thought that he was "the least in his father's house" seems still to possess him, and he can hardly believe it possible that he is to save Israel. In his humility he craves a sign that he is indeed chosen and called. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/6-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Gideon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(gi&#7695;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1439.htm">Strong's 1439: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gideon -- a judge of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
