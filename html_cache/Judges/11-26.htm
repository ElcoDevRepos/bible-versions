The number 300 is symbolic of completeness and divine order in biblical numerology. This time frame suggests a long-established presence, indicating that the Israelites had settled and integrated into the region. Historically, this period covers the time from the conquest under Joshua to the judgeship of Jephthah, reflecting a stable occupation.<p><b>Israel has lived in Heshbon, Aroer, and their villages</b><br>Heshbon and Aroer were significant cities east of the Jordan River. Heshbon was the capital of Sihon, king of the Amorites, whom Israel defeated (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-31</a>). Aroer was located near the Arnon River, marking the southern boundary of the Amorite territory. The mention of "their villages" indicates the extent of Israelite settlement, suggesting a well-established community structure. This occupation fulfilled God's promise to give Israel the land of the Amorites.<p><b>as well as all the cities along the banks of the Arnon</b><br>The Arnon River served as a natural boundary between Moab and the Amorite kingdom. The cities along its banks were strategically important for trade and defense. The Israelites' control of these cities demonstrated their dominance in the region. This control was part of the land promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>Why did you not take them back during that time?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the Ammonites' claim to the land. It implies that if the Ammonites had a legitimate claim, they would have acted within the 300 years of Israelite occupation. The question underscores the idea of divine providence and justice, suggesting that the land was rightfully Israel's by God's decree. It also reflects the biblical principle that God's timing and purposes prevail over human claims and disputes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and vow.

Scripture&#8217;s own timeline (<a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>) leaves ample room for this figure, so we can take it at face value: the people had been rooted there long enough for the land to become part of their national identity.<p>- The statement undercuts any idea that Israel was an intruding squatter. God Himself had opened this territory to them, and they had occupied it peaceably for centuries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israel has lived in Heshbon, Aroer, and their villages</b><p>- Heshbon (<a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>) became the centerpiece city north of the Arnon; Aroer sat at the canyon&#8217;s edge to the south (<a href="/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>).<p>- &#8220;Their villages&#8221; shows settled life&#8212;houses, fields, worship centers&#8212;rather than the tents of nomads.<p>- The fact that &#8220;Israel has lived&#8221; there all this time (not merely camped) stresses uninterrupted, covenant-rooted possession granted by the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As well as all the cities along the banks of the Arnon</b><p>- The Arnon gorge marked the historic boundary between Moab and the Amorites (<a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>). When Israel captured Amorite territory, every town from Heshbon southward to the river became theirs (<a href="/joshua/12-1.htm">Joshua 12:1-2</a>).<p>- By naming &#8220;all the cities,&#8221; Jephthah points to an unbroken chain of Israelite communities, reinforcing that this was not a thin coastal strip but a fully integrated region under Israelite governance.<p>- Generations of Israelites had farmed, traded, and worshiped along those banks, demonstrating the Lord&#8217;s ongoing blessing (<a href="/psalms/78-55.htm">Psalm 78:55</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why did you not take them back during that time?</b><p>- The question is a courtroom challenge. If the Ammonites truly had a rightful claim, why the 300-year silence? Their inaction effectively concedes Israel&#8217;s title.<p>- Ancient Near Eastern custom recognized continuous, uncontested occupation as legitimate ownership, and Scripture often shows the same principle (e.g., <a href="/genesis/21-25.htm">Genesis 21:25-30</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6-9</a>).<p>- More importantly, God had expressly forbidden Israel to seize Ammonite land west of the Jabbok (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). Now Ammon is trying to seize land God had given to Israel&#8212;a direct reversal of divine boundaries.<p>- Jephthah&#8217;s argument therefore rests on two pillars:<p>&#8226; Legal precedence&#8212;three centuries of peaceful possession.<p>&#8226; Divine allocation&#8212;the Lord gave this territory to Israel, and &#8220;what God has blessed, none can revoke&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/23-20.htm">Numbers 23:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jephthah invokes 300 years of uncontested Israelite settlement to prove that the Transjordan cities belong to Israel by both long-standing occupation and God&#8217;s direct gift. Heshbon, Aroer, and the Arnon towns were captured under Moses, inhabited ever since, and never challenged until now. By asking, &#8220;Why did you not take them back during that time?&#8221; Jephthah exposes the Ammonite claim as both legally and theologically baseless, underscoring that God&#8217;s Word establishes the rightful boundaries of His people and that those who ignore His decrees do so at their own peril.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">While Israel dwelt in Heshbon.</span>--See <a href="/numbers/21-25.htm" title="And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.">Numbers 21:25</a>. This is an argument from undisputed possession.<p><span class= "bld">In Aroer and her towns.</span>--These had been assigned to the tribe of Gad (<a href="/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In all the cities that be along by the coast of Arnon.</span>--The LXX. read Jordan.<p><span class= "bld">Three hundred years.</span>--There is an almost insuperable difficulty in making out any reasonable scheme of chronology even by accepting this as a round number, because it is difficult to reconcile with nine or ten genealogies which have been preserved to us, and which represent the period between the conquest and David by seven or eight generations. Now the period covered by these genealogies includes the judgeship of Samuel and the reign of Saul--at least seventy years; and seven or eight generations cannot possibly span 370 years. The hypothesis that in <span class= "ital">all </span>these genealogies--even the four times repeated genealogy of David--generations are always omitted is very improbable. The chronology of the Jews is confessedly loose and uncertain, and it seems quite possible that "three hundred years" may be a marginal gloss which has crept into the text. What makes this more probable is that the words not only create an immense chronological difficulty, but (1) are quite needless to Jephthah's argument, and (2) actually conflict with the rest of the sentence, which refers <span class= "ital">to </span>Balak alone; the argument being, If Balak, "<span class= "ital">at </span>that time" (as the words should be rendered), did not advance any claim, what right have you to do so <span class= "ital">now? </span>If, however, in spite of these difficulties, the clause be genuine, and if there has not been one of the clerical errors which are so common where numerals are concerned, it seems possible that 300 years may be counted inclusively, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>100 full years since the death of Joshua and nominal completion of the conquest of Canaan, with parts of a century before and after it. Certainly this is a recognised mode of reckoning time among the Jews. For instance, if a king began to reign on December 30, 1879, and died on January 2, 1881, they would say that he had reigned three years. Whatever explanations we may adopt, there is nothing but conjecture to go upon. (See Introduction.)<p><span class= "bld">Within that time.</span>--This is a mistranslation, due probably to the perplexity caused by the "three hundred years." The Hebrew has "in that time," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>at that crisis. It was obvious, without special mention, that they had remained in possession ever since Balak's day, and in the most ancient times it was admitted that lapse of time secured possession (Isocr. <span class= "ital">Ep. ad Aechid., </span>p. 121; Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. vi.</span> 31).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - The occupation of the cities and villages referred to is related in <a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a> and following verses, and in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; see too <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Aroer</span> is not mentioned among the cities of Moab taken by the Amorites in the ancient book quoted in <a href="/numbers/21-27.htm">Numbers 21:27</a>-80, and it has been conjectured that it may have been built by the Amorites to secure their new frontier. It is described by Eusebius and Jerome in the 'Onomasticon' as built on a hill overhanging the bank of the Amen, and a ruin called Arair has been foBy the coasts of Arnon</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the banks. The Septuagint for <span class="accented">Arnon</span> reads <span class="accented">Jordan</span>, which was the western boundary, as Arnon was the southern (ver. 22). The corresponding description in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a> is, <span class="accented">From Aroer</span>, <span class="accented">which is by the brink of the river of Arnon</span>, <span class="accented">and from the city that is by the river</span>, <span class="accented">even unto Gilead</span>:, <span class="accented">there was not owe city too strong for us</span>: <span class="accented">the Lord our God delivered all unto us. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Three hundred years</span>. These words seem quite unintelligible and out of place. They are also chronologically impracticable. One expects the number of the cities, as in ver. 33, rather than the number of years; and it is remarkable that the whole number of cities taken by the Israelites on the east of Jordan must have been just about 300, since the half-tribe of Manasseh had sixty. If Gad and Reuben had the same proportion, it would be exactly 300 (5 &times; 60). <span class="cmt_word">Within that time</span>. The Hebrew phrase, which occurs about seventy times, invariably means <span class="accented">at that time</span>, and here can only refer to the time of the first settlement in the days of Balak, of which he had been speaking - another proof that the enumeration <span class="accented">three hundred years</span> is out of place here. If the reading <span class="accented">years is</span> not, as above suggested, an error for <span class="accented">cities</span>, the whole sentence, <span class="accented">three hundred years</span>, may very probably be an interpolation by a professed chronologist. The adding up of all the numbers of the servitudes and rests given in the book gives 301 years from the commencement of the oppression by Chushan-rishathaim to the death of Jair. But this method of reckoning gives the impossible period of 600 years from the exodus to the building of the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/11-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hundred</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1440;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has lived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#353;e&#183;&#7687;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
