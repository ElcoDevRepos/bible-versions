Her position as a prophetess indicates that she was a spokesperson for God, receiving and delivering divine messages. This role is significant as it underscores the idea that God can choose anyone, regardless of gender, to fulfill His purposes. Other notable prophetesses in the Bible include Miriam (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>) and Huldah (<a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>). Deborah's prophetic role also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is neither male nor female (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), emphasizing spiritual equality.<p><b>the wife of Lappidoth</b><br>The mention of Deborah as the wife of Lappidoth provides insight into her personal life, grounding her in a familial context. The name Lappidoth means "torches" or "lights," which could symbolically reflect Deborah's own role as a light and guide for Israel. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a woman's identity was often linked to her husband, yet Deborah's leadership and prophetic role stand out independently, suggesting her significant influence and authority.<p><b>was judging Israel</b><br>Deborah's role as a judge indicates that she was a leader and decision-maker for the nation of Israel. Judges in this period were not only judicial figures but also military leaders and deliverers. Her position as a judge is particularly noteworthy because it demonstrates that God raised her up to lead His people during a time of oppression by the Canaanites. This period of the judges was characterized by a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance, as described in <a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16-19</a>. Deborah's leadership is a testament to God's sovereignty in choosing leaders who may defy societal norms.<p><b>at that time</b><br>The phrase "at that time" situates Deborah's judgeship during a specific period in Israel's history, marked by turmoil and oppression. This was a time when Israel was under the threat of King Jabin of Canaan and his commander Sisera, as detailed in <a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2-3</a>. The historical context is crucial for understanding the challenges Deborah faced and the significance of her leadership. Her judgeship is part of the larger narrative of the Book of Judges, which chronicles the cyclical pattern of Israel's faithfulness and rebellion, highlighting the need for righteous leadership and divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel, Deborah is a unique figure in the Old Testament. She is one of the few female leaders mentioned in the Bible, known for her wisdom and courage. Her role as a judge indicates her leadership and spiritual authority in Israel during a time of oppression.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lappidoth.htm">Lappidoth</a></b><br>Mentioned as Deborah's husband, little is known about Lappidoth.

This role was vital in guiding Israel according to God's will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judging.htm">Judging</a></b><br>Deborah's position as a judge involved settling disputes and providing leadership.

Her appearance follows a familiar pattern in Judges&#8212;Israel falls, God sends a deliverer (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>). The word &#8220;now&#8221; links her story to that cyclical narrative, reminding us that the Lord continually intervenes in literal history to preserve His covenant people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a prophetess</b><p>Calling Deborah &#8220;a prophetess&#8221; reveals her God-given role:<p>&#8226; She received and conveyed direct revelation, as did Miriam (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>) and Huldah (<a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Her prophetic authority rested on God&#8217;s word, not personal status, echoing <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, &#8220;If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, reveal Myself to him in a vision.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Unlike later false prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>), Deborah&#8217;s words proved true in the victory over Sisera (<a href="/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14&#8211;15</a>).

The names of Jewish women were often derived from natural objects, as Rachel, "a lamb," Tamar,"a palm," &c. It has been sometimes regarded as a title given to her as a prophetess, just as the priestesses of Delphi were called Bees (Pindar, <span class= "ital">Pyth. iv.</span> 106); and priests were called by the title Malebee (<span class= "ital">Ess?n</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>But the fact that Rachel's nurse (<a href="/genesis/35-8.htm" title="But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.">Genesis 35:8</a>) had the same name is against this supposition, though Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span>, ? 5) accepts it. She had, as Cornelius a Lapide quaintly says, "a sting for foes, and honey for friends." The pronunciation Deb?rah is now so deeply-rooted in England (possibly from the Vulgate, Debbora) that it would, perhaps, be pedantic to alter it; but properly the "?" is long <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>; LXX., Deborra and Debb?ra).<p><span class= "bld">A prophetess.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a woman, a prophetess; </span>like Miriam (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>), Huldah (<a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>), Noadiah (<a href="/nehemiah/6-14.htm" title="My God, think you on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.">Nehemiah 6:14</a>), Anna (<a href="/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>), &c. She is the only female judge, or, indeed, female ruler of any kind in Jewish history, except the Phoenician murderess, Athaliah. She is also the only judge to whom the title "prophet" is expressly given. "Prophetess" (like the Latin <span class= "ital">Vates</span>) implies the possession of poetic as well as of prophetic gifts (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>); and we see her right to such a title, both in her predictions (<a href="/judges/4-9.htm" title="And she said, I will surely go with you: notwithstanding the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.
