The term "again" suggests a pattern of sin, repentance, and deliverance. The "evil" refers to idolatry and abandoning the covenant with God, as seen in previous chapters (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" emphasizes God's omniscience and the moral standard by which He judges His people. This cycle reflects the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful without strong leadership, highlighting the need for a righteous king, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the King of Kings.<p><b>so He delivered them into the hand of Midian</b><br>The "hand of Midian" refers to the oppressive control and dominance the Midianites exerted over Israel. Historically, the Midianites were nomadic tribes descended from Abraham and Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>). Their oppression is a direct consequence of Israel's disobedience, illustrating the principle that sin leads to bondage. This deliverance into enemy hands serves as divine discipline intended to bring Israel to repentance. The Midianites' oppression is characterized by raids and destruction of crops, leading to severe economic hardship (<a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3-5</a>).<p><b>for seven years,</b><br>The number seven often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible. Here, it signifies a complete period of judgment and oppression. The seven-year duration reflects God's patience and the sufficiency of time for Israel to recognize their sin and cry out for deliverance. This period of suffering sets the stage for God to raise up Gideon as a judge and deliverer, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate deliverer who rescues humanity from the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who repeatedly fall into cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance throughout the Book of Judges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is just and righteous, allowing consequences for sin but also providing deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>A nomadic people who oppressed Israel as a consequence of their disobedience.
