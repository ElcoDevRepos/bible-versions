In the context of Judges, altars were often built to commemorate divine encounters or covenants. This act follows Gideon's encounter with the Angel of the LORD, which reassured him of God's presence and mission for him. Building an altar was a common practice in the Old Testament, seen with figures like Noah, Abraham, and Jacob, symbolizing a place of sacrifice, worship, and remembrance.<p><b>and called it The LORD Is Peace.</b><br>The name "The LORD Is Peace" (Yahweh Shalom) reflects the peace Gideon experienced after his fear of dying from seeing the Angel of the LORD was alleviated. This name is significant as it highlights God's character as a bringer of peace, even amidst the turmoil of Israel's oppression by the Midianites. It foreshadows the peace that Christ, the Prince of Peace, brings to believers, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> and fulfilled in the New Testament.<p><b>To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</b><br>The phrase "to this day" suggests that the altar remained a lasting memorial for the Israelites, serving as a testament to God's intervention and Gideon's faith. Ophrah, located in the territory of the tribe of Manasseh, was Gideon's hometown and the center of his family's clan, the Abiezrites. This geographical detail roots the narrative in a specific historical and cultural context, emphasizing the tangible reality of God's actions in Israel's history. The enduring presence of the altar underscores the lasting impact of divine encounters and the importance of remembering God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Altars in Scripture mark decisive encounters with God:<p>&#8226; Noah built an altar after the flood (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Abram erected altars whenever God revealed Himself (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; 13:18).<p>&#8226; Moses built one and named it &#8220;The LORD Is My Banner&#8221; after victory (<a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>).<p>By raising an altar, Gideon testifies that the LORD alone delivered him from fear. The action underscores Scripture&#8217;s literal accuracy&#8212;an actual structure on actual ground affirming an actual meeting between God and man.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and called it The LORD Is Peace</b><p>Gideon names the altar &#8220;YHWH Shalom,&#8221; proclaiming God&#8217;s character: the LORD Himself is peace, not merely a giver of peaceful circumstances.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> hails Messiah as &#8220;Prince of Peace.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a> promises perfect peace to the one whose mind trusts God.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this identity: &#8220;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give you&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul declares, &#8220;He Himself is our peace&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p>Gideon had been threshing grain in hiding (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>), yet in one encounter God transformed inner turmoil into settled confidence. The name teaches that peace flows from God&#8217;s presence and promise, not from changed circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites</b><p>The writer notes that, at the time of recording, Gideon&#8217;s altar still existed&#8212;a public, physical witness to God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Joshua set up memorial stones so future generations would ask, &#8220;What do these stones mean to you?&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel later raised a stone named &#8220;Ebenezer,&#8221; saying, &#8220;Thus far the LORD has helped us&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>).<p>In the same way, Gideon&#8217;s altar in Ophrah reminded every passer-by that the LORD brought peace to fearful people and would keep doing so. The durability of the altar underscores the reliability of the biblical account&#8212;real places, real artifacts, real history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/6-24.htm">Judges 6:24</a> records Gideon&#8217;s immediate, worshipful response to God&#8217;s promise: he builds a lasting altar, names it &#8220;The LORD Is Peace,&#8221; and leaves a memorial in his hometown. The verse teaches that genuine encounters with God produce outward acts of remembrance and inward assurance. Peace is not abstract; it is the very presence of the LORD who meets fearful hearts and turns them into faithful witnesses&#8212;then and now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Built an altar.</span>--Altars, like the altar Ed (<a href="/joshua/22-34.htm" title="And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.">Joshua 22:34</a>), built by the Transjordanic tribes, were not always intended for purposes of sacrifices, but to witness some great event or Divine appearance (<a href="/genesis/31-48.htm" title="And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you this day.
