His approach to the angel of the Lord shows a desire for clarity and obedience. This reflects a common biblical theme where individuals seek divine direction, as seen in the lives of figures like Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>) and Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>).<p><b>&#8220;When your words come to pass</b><br>Manoah demonstrates faith in the prophecy given by the angel, indicating his belief that the promise of a son will indeed be fulfilled. This mirrors the faith of Abraham, who believed God's promise of a son despite his old age (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). It highlights the importance of faith in God's promises, a recurring theme throughout Scripture.<p><b>what will be the boy&#8217;s rule of life</b><br>Manoah is concerned with the upbringing and lifestyle of his future son, Samson. This reflects the cultural and religious importance of raising children according to God's laws, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>. The phrase suggests a desire to understand the Nazirite vow, which Samson was to follow (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>), emphasizing a life set apart for God.<p><b>and mission?&#8221;</b><br>Manoah seeks to understand the purpose and calling of his son, which is a common biblical inquiry. The mission of Samson was to begin the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). This foreshadows the ultimate deliverance brought by Jesus Christ, who came to save humanity from sin (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>).

Samson&#8217;s mission is national, not merely personal.<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs calling with consecration: <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a> speaks of being set apart from the womb; Paul is &#8220;set apart for the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Knowing a child&#8217;s purpose shapes parenting goals&#8212;discipleship with direction (<a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Manoah&#8217;s question in <a href="/judges/13-12.htm">Judges 13:12</a> reveals a father who trusts God&#8217;s promise, seeks precise guidance, and desires to align his son&#8217;s daily habits with his divine mission.

The saying marks Manoah's earnest desire for a son. Some, however, construe it, <span class="accented">If thy words come. <span class="cmt_word"></span>How shall we order</span>, etc. - literally, <span class="accented">What will be the manner of the child</span>, and what will be his doing? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either, <span class="accented">What will be his manner</span> (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>, and following verses), <span class="accented">and what will be his action or work?</span> or, <span class="accented">What will be his proper treatment</span>, <span class="accented">and what shall be done to him?</span> The former is the most natural rendering of the words, and though the latter seems at first more suitable to the angel's reply, yet if we take the angel's reply as referring Manoah to what he had said before in vers. 4 and 5, we have a distinct answer to the questions. His manner will be to live as a Nazarite, and his action or work will be to begin to deliver israel (cf. <a href="/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>, where both the <span class="accented">manner</span> and the actione of Ishmael are foretold). In fact, Manoah's question refers directly to vers. 4 and 5, and is a request to have a confirmation of what was then said; just as David asked again and again, <span class="accented">What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine?</span> (<a href="/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26, 30</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/13-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Manoah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4495.htm">Strong's 4495: </a> </span><span class="str2">Manoah -- father of Samson</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
