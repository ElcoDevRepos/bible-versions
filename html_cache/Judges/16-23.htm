These lords often collaborated for military and religious purposes. The gathering signifies a significant event, likely held in a major city like Gaza, Ashdod, or Ashkelon. This assembly underscores the political unity and religious fervor of the Philistines, who were a constant threat to Israel during the period of the Judges.<p><b>to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon.</b><br>Dagon was a major deity in the Philistine pantheon, often associated with grain and fertility. Archaeological findings, such as temples dedicated to Dagon, highlight his importance. The sacrifice indicates a religious ceremony, possibly involving animal offerings, to thank Dagon for their perceived victory. This act of worship reflects the Philistine belief in Dagon's power over their fortunes, contrasting with the Israelites' worship of Yahweh.<p><b>They rejoiced and said,</b><br>The Philistines' rejoicing reveals their triumphalism and confidence in their god's superiority. This celebration likely included feasting, music, and dancing, common in ancient Near Eastern victory rituals. Their joy is not just over Samson's capture but also a perceived validation of their religious beliefs.<p><b>&#8220;Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects the Philistine interpretation of events as divine intervention. Samson, a Nazirite and judge of Israel, had been a formidable adversary, causing significant destruction to the Philistines. His capture is seen as a victory for Dagon over Yahweh, echoing the ancient belief that military success was tied to the power of one's deity.

The Philistines are a foreshadowing of that misplaced celebration.<p>&#8226; For believers, this moment warns against envying the apparent triumph of evil (<a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2-3</a>).
