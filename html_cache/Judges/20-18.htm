Historically, the tribes often acted together in times of crisis, reflecting their covenant relationship with God and each other. This unity is crucial in the narrative of Judges, where tribal disunity often leads to chaos and moral decline.<p><b>went up to Bethel</b><br>Bethel, meaning "House of God," was a significant religious site for the Israelites. It was a place where patriarchs like Abraham and Jacob had encounters with God (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8, 28</a>:19). The choice of Bethel for seeking divine guidance underscores its spiritual importance and the Israelites' desire to align their actions with God's will.<p><b>and inquired of God</b><br>This reflects the practice of seeking divine guidance before making significant decisions, a common theme in the Old Testament. The Israelites used the Urim and Thummim, sacred lots, or consulted prophets to discern God's will. This practice highlights their dependence on God for direction and success.<p><b>&#8220;Who of us shall go up first to fight against the Benjamites?&#8221;</b><br>The question reveals the gravity of the situation, as the Israelites are preparing for civil war against one of their own tribes. This internal conflict arose from the moral corruption and lawlessness depicted in the preceding chapters. The inquiry shows their desire for divine strategy in warfare, a recurring theme in Israel's military history.<p><b>&#8220;Judah will be first,&#8221; the LORD replied.</b><br>Judah's selection as the leading tribe is significant, as it aligns with earlier biblical themes where Judah is often given prominence (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>). This foreshadows Judah's future role in Israel's monarchy and the lineage of Jesus Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>).

Bethel (&#8220;house of God&#8221;) had historic significance: Abram built an altar there (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>), Jacob met God there (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By gathering at Bethel, the people align themselves with their forefathers&#8217; worship and covenant commitments (<a href="/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast their God-centered venue with Gibeah&#8217;s godlessness;

Apparently the high priest was not prevented by any scruple from taking the ephod, with its jewelled breastplate and Urim and Thummim, to any place where its use was needed.

The conclusion is that at this time the ark of God, with the tabernacle, was at Bethel, which was only seven or eight miles from Shiloh. Bethel would be eight or ten miles from Gibeah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about half way between Shiloh and Gibeah. <span class="cmt_word">Asked counsel</span>. The same phrase as <a href="/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, where it is rendered simply asked (see note to <a href="/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, and vers. 23, 47). In following this precedent the Israelites put the men of Gibeah on the footing of the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. With reference to ver. 9, it is worth considering whether this is not the fulfilment of the purpose there expressed by the Israelites, to go up against Gibeah <span class="accented">by lot</span>; either by understanding that the answer asked was given by a Divinely-directed <span class="accented">lot</span>, according to which Judah's turn came first (see <a href="/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14-18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41</a>; <a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24-26</a>; etc.), or by taking the expression <span class="accented">by lot</span> in a wider sense, as meaning generally Divine direction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set out,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1467;&#1436;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;qu&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
