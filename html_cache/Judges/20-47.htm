The number 600 is significant, as it represents a small fraction of the original fighting force, highlighting the severity of the conflict. The act of fleeing suggests desperation and a strategic retreat to preserve life. This remnant concept is echoed throughout Scripture, where God often preserves a faithful few, such as Noah's family during the flood or the remnant of Israel in prophetic writings.<p><b>into the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness often symbolizes a place of testing, refuge, and divine encounter in the Bible. It is a place where God meets His people, as seen with Moses and the Israelites during the Exodus. The wilderness serves as a backdrop for transformation and reliance on God, suggesting that the Benjaminites' time there could be a period of reflection and potential repentance.<p><b>to the rock of Rimmon</b><br>The rock of Rimmon is a specific geographical location, likely a natural fortress or stronghold, providing a strategic advantage for defense and survival. Rocks and high places in Scripture often symbolize safety and refuge, akin to God being described as a "rock" or "fortress" in Psalms. This location underscores the Benjaminites' need for protection and security after their defeat.<p><b>where they stayed four months</b><br>The duration of four months indicates a significant period of waiting and uncertainty. Biblically, the number four can symbolize completeness or universality, as seen in the four corners of the earth or the four living creatures in Revelation. This time frame suggests a complete cycle of waiting, possibly for divine intervention or the resolution of conflict. The period of waiting can also be seen as a time for the Benjaminites to regroup and plan their next steps, reflecting themes of patience and endurance found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel involved in a civil war against the other Israelite tribes due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rock_of_rimmon.htm">The Rock of Rimmon</a></b><br>A location in the wilderness where the surviving Benjamite men sought refuge after their defeat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>Represents a place of refuge and survival, often associated with testing and divine encounters in the Bible.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_civil_war.htm">The Civil War</a></b><br>A conflict between the tribe of Benjamin and the other tribes of Israel, sparked by the atrocity committed in Gibeah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_months.htm">The Four Months</a></b><br>The period during which the surviving Benjamites stayed at the rock, indicating a time of reflection and regrouping.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The civil war and near destruction of the tribe of Benjamin serve as a stark reminder of the severe consequences of unchecked sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_refuge_in_god.htm">Seeking Refuge in God</a></b><br>Just as the Benjamites found refuge at the rock of Rimmon, believers are called to seek refuge in God during times of trial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_experience.htm">The Wilderness Experience</a></b><br>Times of isolation and testing can lead to spiritual growth and renewal if we remain faithful and seek God's guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_reconciliation.htm">Community and Reconciliation</a></b><br>The eventual reconciliation between the Benjamites and the other tribes underscores the importance of unity and forgiveness within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_trials.htm">Perseverance in Trials</a></b><br>The endurance of the Benjamites during their four months at the rock encourages believers to persevere through difficult seasons, trusting in God's provision and timing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_20_47_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 20:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_47_God_s_provision_in_crisis.htm">How does Judges 20:47 demonstrate God's provision even in dire circumstances?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_600_men_who_fled_to_rock.htm">What lessons can we learn from the 600 men who "fled to the rock"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_this_verse_to_Psalm_91_s_protection.htm">How does this verse connect to God's protection in Psalm 91?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_God_s_refuge_in_struggles.htm">How can we seek refuge in God during our personal battles today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_47_Perseverance_lesson.htm">What does Judges 20:47 teach about perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_600_Benjamites_survive.htm">Why did 600 Benjamite men survive when others perished in Judges 20:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_47_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">What does Judges 20:47 reveal about God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_47_s_role_in_tribal_conflicts.htm">How does Judges 20:47 fit into the broader narrative of Israel's tribal conflicts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_judges_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Judges 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_there_evidence_for_cycles_in_ezekiel_20.htm">Historically and archaeologically, is there evidence to support the repeated cycles of rebellion and divine judgment described throughout Ezekiel 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_promote_abduction_in_judges_21_20-23.htm">Why does the text promote the abduction of women as a solution for the tribe of Benjamin (Judges 21:20&#8211;23)?

If these 600 survivors are added to the 25,000, or 25,100, enumerated as slain (vers. '35, 44), it gives a total of 25,700. But the total number of Benjamites, as given in ver. 15, was 26,700. There remain, therefore, 1000 men unaccounted for. These may, have been killed partly in the two first days successful battles (vers. 21, 25), and partly in the different cities into which they had escaped, when the general massacre recorded in ver. 48 took place. <span class="cmt_word">The rock Rimmon</span>. There are two proposed identifications of this place. One makes it the same as <span class="accented">Rummon</span>, "a village perched on the summit of a conical chalky hill," "rising on the south side to a height of several hundred feet from the Wady Muti-yah," and defended on the west side "by a cross valley of great depth," which lies three miles east of Bethel, and seven miles northeast of Gibeah (Tulell el-Ful), and is situated in the wilderness between the highlands of Benjamin and the Jordan. This is advocated by Robinson ('Biblical Researches,' 1:440), by Mr. Grove in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' and by Lt. Conder ('Quart. State. for July 1880,' P. 173). The other is advocated by Mr. W. F. Birch ('Pal. Expl., Quart. State. for April 1880'). This identifies it with the <span class="accented">Wady er-Rummon</span>, discovered by Mr. Rawnsley, where there is a vast cave, <span class="accented">Mugharet el Jai</span>, about a mile and a half from Geba, capable, according to the local tradition, of holding 600 men, and used to the present day by the villagers as a place of refuge from the government persecutions According to this view, the statement that they abode in the rock Rimmon is strictly correct. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But six</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8337.htm">Strong's 8337: </a> </span><span class="str2">Six (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hundred</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">turned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#772;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
