The father's role in arranging marriages was significant, reflecting the patriarchal structure of society. This visit signifies the formalization of the betrothal, a critical step in the marriage process. The woman in question is a Philistine, highlighting the tension between Israel and the Philistines, as Israelites were generally discouraged from intermarrying with foreign nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). This sets the stage for the conflict and divine purpose that unfolds in Samson's life.<p><b>and Samson prepared a feast there</b><br>The feast mentioned here is a traditional wedding feast, which was an essential part of the marriage celebration in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Such feasts could last for several days, as seen in the wedding at Cana (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>). The preparation of the feast by Samson himself may indicate his active role in the proceedings, which is somewhat unusual given the typical involvement of family and community in such events. This feast also foreshadows the events that will lead to conflict with the Philistines, as it is during this time that Samson poses his famous riddle.<p><b>as was customary for the bridegroom</b><br>This phrase underscores the cultural norms of the time, where the bridegroom was expected to host a feast for the wedding guests. The custom reflects the social and communal nature of marriage in ancient Israel, where weddings were not just personal but community events. The bridegroom's responsibility to provide a feast is a precursor to the New Testament imagery of Christ as the bridegroom (<a href="/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>), who prepares a heavenly banquet for His bride, the Church. This typology points to the ultimate fulfillment of marriage in the union between Christ and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.

Compare Boaz providing grain and joy at his own marriage (<a href="/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>; 4:13).<p>&#8226; The setting in Timnah, a Philistine town, hints at tension: Israel&#8217;s judge mingles with Israel&#8217;s oppressors (<a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>). His Nazirite calling (<a href="/numbers/6-1.htm">Numbers 6:1-8</a>) contrasts with a feast likely featuring wine, foreshadowing further compromise (<a href="/judges/14-17.htm">Judges 14:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as was customary for the bridegroom</b><p>&#8226; The text clarifies this was standard practice, not extravagance.

The verse illustrates normal societal patterns while exposing Samson&#8217;s willingness to blend into Philistine life, setting the stage for conflicts that arise from a judge of Israel living by cultural custom rather than by his Nazirite calling and Israel&#8217;s covenant distinctiveness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Went down unto the woman.</span>--Formally, to claim her as the bride of his son.<p><span class= "bld">Made there a feast.</span>--According to the universal custom in all ages (<a href="/genesis/29-22.htm" title="And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.">Genesis 29:22</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

It is not clear what is meant by this mention of his father alone; but it was probably some part of the wedding etiquette that the father should go to the bride first alone; perhaps, as Kimehi says, to give her notice of the bridegroom's approach, that she might get ready. Among the preparations may have been the selection of the thirty young men to be "the children of the bride-chamber" (<a href="/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>). As these were all Philistines, the inference is that they were selected by the bride, just as with us the bride has the privilege of choosing the minister who is to officiate at the marriage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/14-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then his father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
