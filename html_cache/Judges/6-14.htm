In the context of <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>, the Israelites are oppressed by the Midianites due to their disobedience to God. The LORD's turning to Gideon signifies divine attention and intervention. This mirrors other biblical instances where God personally calls individuals, such as Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> and Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>, highlighting the personal nature of God's call.<p><b>Go in the strength you have</b><br>Here, God acknowledges Gideon's existing capabilities, emphasizing that divine missions often begin with what we already possess. This phrase suggests that God empowers individuals by using their inherent strengths, as seen with David's use of a sling in <a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>. It also reflects the biblical principle that God equips those He calls, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where believers are reminded they can do all things through Christ who strengthens them.<p><b>and save Israel from the hand of Midian</b><br>This command identifies the specific mission: deliverance of Israel from Midianite oppression. Historically, the Midianites were a nomadic people who invaded Israel during harvest time, causing severe economic hardship (<a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3-5</a>). This deliverance echoes the recurring theme of God raising judges to rescue Israel, as seen with Deborah and Barak in <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4-5</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who saves humanity from sin.<p><b>Am I not sending you?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores God's authority and assurance in His commissioning of Gideon. It reassures Gideon of divine backing, similar to God's assurance to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>. This phrase highlights the concept of divine mission and purpose, affirming that when God sends someone, He also provides the necessary support and guidance. It reflects the New Testament commission in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, where Jesus sends His disciples with the promise of His presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the central figure in this passage, commissioning Gideon for a divine task.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, suffering under the oppression of the Midianites due to their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic people who oppressed Israel, causing them to cry out to God for deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/ophrah.htm">Ophrah</a></b><br>The location where the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, marking the beginning of his divine mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_calling_and_empowerment.htm">Divine Calling and Empowerment</a></b><br>God often calls us to tasks that seem beyond our capabilities, but He equips us with the strength we need.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_in_faith.htm">Obedience in Faith</a></b><br>Like Gideon, we must step out in faith, trusting that God is with us and will accomplish His purposes through us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence.htm">God's Presence</a></b><br>The assurance of God's presence ("Am I not sending you?") is crucial for overcoming fear and doubt.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god_uses_the_unlikely.htm">God Uses the Unlikely</a></b><br>God often chooses those who seem least likely to succeed by human standards, demonstrating His power and glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_oppression.htm">Responding to Oppression</a></b><br>Just as Israel cried out to God in their distress, we are encouraged to seek God in times of trouble, trusting in His deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_6_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 6:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Judges_6_14_inspire_action.htm">How does Judges 6:14 inspire you to act on God's calling today?

That same pattern of divine nearness appears throughout Scripture, whether in Jesus turning to the woman who touched His garment (<a href="/mark/5-32.htm">Mark 5:32</a>) or the risen Lord confronting Saul (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said,</b><p>- God speaks clearly and authoritatively; His words create faith and set history in motion (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>- Gideon&#8217;s circumstances have not yet changed, but God&#8217;s word supplies the perspective and power needed for change (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go in the strength you have</b><p>- The directive recognizes Gideon&#8217;s existing, though limited, capacity.

Gideon must act with the modest strength he already possesses, confident that the LORD who sends him will supply all that is lacking. The verse invites every follower of Christ to believe that when God turns, speaks, commands, and commissions, His presence ensures both the power and the outcome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The Lord looked upon him.</span>--Here, as in <a href="/genesis/18-13.htm" title="And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?">Genesis 18:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-17.htm" title="And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;">Genesis 18:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm" title="And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;">Genesis 18:20</a>, the angel speaks as the Lord, and it has been hence inferred that this angel was no created angel, but "the angel of the covenant," "the captain of the Lord's host."
