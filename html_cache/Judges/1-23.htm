This strategy was previously employed by Moses when he sent spies into the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13:1-2</a>) and by Joshua at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>). Bethel, meaning "House of God," was a significant location in Israel's history, first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a> when Abram built an altar to the Lord. It later became a central place of worship and a site of divine encounters, such as Jacob's dream of the ladder (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-19</a>). The sending of spies indicates a strategic and cautious approach to warfare, relying on human intelligence while ultimately depending on divine guidance.<p><b>(formerly known as Luz)</b><br>Luz was the original name of the city before it was renamed Bethel by Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). The renaming signifies a transformation from a Canaanite city to a place of divine significance for the Israelites. Luz is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/35-6.htm">Genesis 35:6 and 48</a>:3, highlighting its importance in the patriarchal narratives. The change from Luz to Bethel reflects the broader theme of God&#8217;s promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the transformation of the land from Canaanite to Israelite control. The renaming also prefigures the spiritual transformation that occurs when God claims a place or person for His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_joseph.htm">House of Joseph</a></b><br>Refers to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, descendants of Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob.
