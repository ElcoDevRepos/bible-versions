The "angel of the LORD" is a recurring figure in the Old Testament, often seen as a theophany, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. The angel's departure signifies the completion of his message, which was to announce the birth of Samson, a future judge of Israel. The absence of further appearances emphasizes the finality and sufficiency of the divine message delivered. This encounter is reminiscent of other angelic visitations, such as those to Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 18) and to Gideon (Judges 6), where the angel's presence signifies God's direct intervention in human affairs.<p><b>Manoah realized that it had been the angel of the LORD</b><br>Manoah's realization marks a moment of spiritual insight and recognition of divine presence. Initially, Manoah and his wife did not fully comprehend the identity of their visitor. This realization is crucial as it underscores the holiness and authority of the message they received. The recognition of the angel of the LORD often leads to a deeper understanding of God's will and purpose, as seen in other biblical narratives. This moment parallels the recognition of divine messengers in other scriptures, such as Jacob's encounter at Peniel (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>) and the disciples' realization of Jesus' identity post-resurrection (<a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>). The acknowledgment of the angel's true identity also reflects the broader biblical theme of God revealing Himself progressively to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>The father of Samson, Manoah is a Danite who, along with his wife, receives a divine promise of a son who will begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah's_wife.htm">Manoah's Wife</a></b><br>Though unnamed in the text, she is the mother of Samson.

Similar moments occur when the LORD departs after speaking with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-33.htm">Genesis 18:33</a>) or when Jesus vanishes at Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Departure underscores that the message is complete: the promised child, Samson, will indeed be born. There is no need for further clarification or negotiation.<p>&#8226; It also prevents any temptation to turn a holy visitation into routine familiarity (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a> reminds us no one can see God continually and live).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Manoah and his wife</b><p>&#8226; Both spouses are included, highlighting God&#8217;s care for the entire family. The promise of Samson&#8217;s birth began with the wife (<a href="/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3</a>) and is now confirmed in the presence of her husband&#8212;much like the angelic announcements to both Zechariah and Elizabeth about John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11&#8211;25, 57</a>-60).<p>&#8226; The couple stands united in witness; later, Samson&#8217;s mission will rely on their shared obedience to the Nazirite instructions (<a href="/judges/13-13.htm">Judges 13:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Manoah realized</b><p>&#8226; Awareness dawns only after the angel is gone&#8212;echoing Jacob&#8217;s &#8220;Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was unaware&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-16.htm">Genesis 28:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Moments of realization often follow divine encounters: Gideon in <a href="/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22</a>, or the disciples recognizing Jesus only after the breaking of bread in <a href="/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30&#8211;32</a>.<p>&#8226; Realization produces holy fear (<a href="/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>) but also deeper faith, moving Manoah from questioning (v. 17) to worshipful acceptance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that it had been the angel of the LORD.</b><p>&#8226; Recognition affirms the authenticity of the message: God Himself has spoken, so the promised son and his mission are certain (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; It reshapes Manoah&#8217;s theology&#8212;he now understands he stood before the LORD&#8217;s representative. Like Moses before the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>), he must respond with reverence.<p>&#8226; This recognition sets the stage for the parents&#8217; obedience, ensuring Samson grows under the Nazirite vow that will equip him for Israel&#8217;s deliverance (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse marks the decisive moment when the heavenly visitor departs and Manoah grasps who has been speaking. The sudden absence authenticates the encounter, the shared experience unifies the couple, and the realization anchors their faith. From this point forward they will treat Samson&#8217;s impending birth not as a hopeful possibility but as a guaranteed work of God, shaping the boy&#8212;and the nation&#8212;for the deliverance God has planned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>.
