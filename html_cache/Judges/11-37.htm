In the context of <a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>, Jephthah had made a vow to the Lord to offer as a burnt offering whatever came out of his house to greet him if he returned victorious from battle. His daughter was the first to greet him, leading to this tragic situation. The interaction underscores the importance of vows in ancient Israelite culture and the patriarchal nature of family dynamics.<p><b>Let me do this one thing</b><br>The request indicates a sense of agency and a desire to fulfill a personal need before the vow is carried out. It reflects the cultural practices of the time, where vows were taken seriously and had to be fulfilled, even at great personal cost. This request also shows the daughter's acceptance of her fate and her desire to prepare herself emotionally and spiritually.<p><b>Let me wander for two months</b><br>The two-month period suggests a time of preparation and reflection. In biblical times, periods of mourning and preparation were common, often involving specific time frames. This request for time indicates the daughter's understanding of the gravity of the situation and her desire to process it fully. The number two can symbolize witness or testimony in biblical numerology, perhaps indicating her life as a testimony to the seriousness of vows.<p><b>through the mountains</b><br>The mountains in biblical literature often symbolize places of encounter with God, refuge, or isolation. This setting provides a backdrop for reflection and mourning, away from the community. The geographical reference to the mountains may also suggest a place of solitude and contemplation, fitting for the daughter's purpose.<p><b>with my friends</b><br>The inclusion of friends in this request highlights the communal aspect of mourning and support. In ancient Israel, community and relationships were vital, and friends would play a significant role in providing comfort and companionship. This reflects the cultural importance of community in times of personal crisis.<p><b>and mourn my virginity</b><br>Mourning virginity in this context refers to lamenting the unfulfilled potential of marriage and motherhood, which were highly valued in ancient Israelite society. Virginity here symbolizes the loss of future prospects and the continuation of family lineage. This mourning is not just for her own life but for the societal expectations and roles she will never fulfill. The emphasis on virginity also connects to themes of purity and sacrifice, which can be seen as a type of Christ, who was the ultimate pure sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah's_daughter.htm">Jephthah's Daughter</a></b><br>The unnamed daughter of Jephthah, who becomes the central figure in this passage.

Her words reveal several things:<p>&#8226; Respectful submission&#8212;she honors her father even in a tragic moment, echoing the spirit of <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>, &#8220;Honor your father and your mother.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Faith that God&#8217;s will is just&#8212;her calm tone resembles Samuel&#8217;s &#8220;Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Acceptance of the vow&#8217;s binding nature&#8212;<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> states that a vow to the LORD &#8220;must not break his word.&#8221; She recognizes that the vow, however painful, stands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let me do this one thing</b><p>She asks permission rather than demanding, showing humility. Compare Abigail&#8217;s plea to David&#8212;&#8220;Let your servant speak to you; hear what your servant has to say&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/25-24.htm">1 Samuel 25:24</a>). Both women trust God&#8217;s sovereignty yet still appeal for a measured response. Her request is singular: one last, limited mercy before the vow is fulfilled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let me wander for two months</b><p>The time frame is precise, suggesting purposeful preparation rather than mere delay. Two months allows for:<p>&#8226; Emotional processing&#8212;like Hezekiah who turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly when told of impending death (<a href="/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Community awareness&#8212;similar to Israel&#8217;s mourning thirty days for Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical arrangements&#8212;ensuring everything is in order before the vow is carried out.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through the mountains with my friends</b><p>The setting and companions matter:<p>&#8226; Mountains signify separation from daily life&#8212;Moses met God on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-3.htm">Exodus 19:3</a>). Here the mountains give privacy for grief.<p>&#8226; Friends provide comfort&#8212;Job&#8217;s companions sat with him in silence seven days (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11-13</a>).

To leave no descendants meant her family line ended.<p>&#8226; Virginity signified unfulfilled marriage hopes&#8212;compare <a href="/psalms/113-9.htm">Psalm 113:9</a>, where the LORD makes the barren woman &#8220;a joyful mother of children.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Perpetual virginity also fits the view that Jephthah dedicated her to lifelong service rather than literal sacrifice. <a href="/judges/11-39.htm">Judges 11:39</a> adds, &#8220;She had no relations with a man,&#8221; underscoring that her sorrow centers on lost motherhood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/11-37.htm">Judges 11:37</a> captures a young woman&#8217;s faithful, measured response to an irrevocable vow. With respect for her father and trust in the LORD, she requests two months to grieve in the mountains with supportive friends, focusing her lament on the end of her lineage. Her words underscore the weight of vows, the value of community in sorrow, and the deep biblical longing for covenant legacy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">Let me alone two months.</span>--There was nothing which forbade this postponement for a definite purpose and period of the fulfilment of the vow.
