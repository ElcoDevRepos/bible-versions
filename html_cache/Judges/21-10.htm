The number 12,000 may symbolize completeness or divine order, as the number 12 often represents the tribes of Israel. The term "valiant men" suggests warriors of proven courage and skill, reflecting the seriousness of the mission. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God&#8217;s people are called to act decisively, such as the selection of warriors in Gideon's army (Judges 7).<p><b>and commanded them:</b><br>The use of "commanded" implies a directive with authority, reflecting the leadership structure within the Israelite community. This command comes from the assembly, showing a collective responsibility and decision-making process. It highlights the seriousness of the situation and the need for obedience to communal decisions, akin to the commands given by Moses or Joshua in earlier biblical narratives.<p><b>&#8220;Go and put to the sword those living in Jabesh-gilead,</b><br>Jabesh-gilead was a city east of the Jordan River, in the territory of Gilead. This location is significant in Israel's history, later becoming a place of refuge for Saul's bones (<a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>). The command to "put to the sword" indicates a complete destruction, a practice seen in other biblical accounts such as the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>). This reflects the severity of the situation and the perceived need for purging sin from among the people, reminiscent of the herem or ban in ancient Israelite warfare.<p><b>including women and children.</b><br>The inclusion of women and children in this command underscores the totality of the judgment. This harsh measure reflects the gravity of the offense in the eyes of the Israelites, possibly linked to the failure of Jabesh-gilead to support the collective action against Benjamin. It echoes other instances in Scripture where entire populations were devoted to destruction, such as the Amalekites (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>).

Here they are responding to the gross sin that had occurred in Gibeah (<a href="/bsb/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>) and to the oath they had taken (<a href="/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s people are corporately responsible for upholding covenant faithfulness, even when the task is painful (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sent 12,000 of their most valiant men</b><p>&#8226; A select strike force&#8212;&#8220;valiant&#8221; men known for courage and skill (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Twelve thousand represents roughly one thousand from each tribe, echoing <a href="/numbers/31-5.htm">Numbers 31:5</a> when Israel deployed &#8220;a thousand from each tribe&#8221; against Midian.<p>&#8226; The deliberate, organized nature of this mission underscores the seriousness of Israel&#8217;s oath and the perceived need to purge covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and commanded them</b><p>&#8226; These soldiers did not act on personal impulse; they moved under explicit, communal orders.
