The staff is a symbol of authority and divine power, reminiscent of Moses' staff used to perform miracles in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a>). The act of extending the staff signifies the initiation of a divine act, emphasizing God's direct intervention in human affairs.<p><b>and touched the meat and the unleavened bread.</b><br>The offering of meat and unleavened bread reflects the sacrificial practices of the time, similar to the peace offerings described in <a href="/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-15</a>. Unleavened bread is significant in Israelite tradition, symbolizing purity and the haste of the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a>). The touching of the offering by the angel signifies divine acceptance and sanctification of Gideon's sacrifice.<p><b>And fire flared from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread.</b><br>Fire is a frequent biblical symbol of God's presence and purification (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). The spontaneous combustion of the offering indicates divine approval and mirrors other instances where God accepts sacrifices by fire, such as with Elijah on Mount Carmel. The rock, often a symbol of strength and stability, serves as the altar, highlighting God's ability to sanctify the ordinary for His purposes.<p><b>Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.</b><br>The sudden disappearance of the angel underscores the supernatural nature of the encounter. It parallels other biblical instances where divine messengers depart after delivering their message (<a href="/judges/13-20.htm">Judges 13:20-21</a>). This vanishing act leaves Gideon with a profound sense of awe and fear, reinforcing the reality of the divine encounter and the call to trust in God's presence and power, even when not visibly apparent.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
