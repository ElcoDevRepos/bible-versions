The act of planting crops signifies a period of hope and expectation for a harvest, which is essential for survival. In the context of the Judges, this period is marked by the Israelites' disobedience to God, leading to their oppression by surrounding nations. The agricultural cycle is a reminder of the Israelites' dependence on God for provision, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-17</a>, where obedience to God is linked to agricultural prosperity.<p><b>the Midianites, Amalekites, and other people of the east</b><br>The Midianites and Amalekites were nomadic tribes known for their raids and warfare tactics. The Midianites, descendants of Abraham through Keturah, had previously been defeated by Moses (Numbers 31), yet they reappear as oppressors due to Israel's disobedience. The Amalekites, descendants of Esau, were long-standing enemies of Israel, first attacking them in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>. The "people of the east" likely refers to other nomadic groups from the Arabian desert region. This coalition of enemies highlights the severity of Israel's plight and the fulfillment of God's warnings about the consequences of disobedience (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14-15</a>).<p><b>would come up and invade them</b><br>The invasions were not just military attacks but also economic devastations. The repeated invasions during harvest time were strategic, aimed at crippling Israel's food supply and economy. This tactic of oppression is reminiscent of the curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>, where foreign nations would consume the produce of the land due to Israel's unfaithfulness. The invasions serve as a physical manifestation of Israel's spiritual state, emphasizing the need for repentance and deliverance. This cycle of oppression and deliverance is a recurring theme in Judges, pointing to the ultimate need for a savior, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who delivers from spiritual bondage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are experiencing oppression due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic people who, along with the Amalekites and others, oppressed Israel by raiding their land and destroying their crops.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A group often in conflict with Israel, known for their hostility and attacks on the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/eastern_peoples.htm">Eastern Peoples</a></b><br>Other nomadic tribes from the east who joined the Midianites and Amalekites in their raids.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The Promised Land given to the Israelites, which is now under threat due to their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Israel's suffering under the Midianites is a direct result of their disobedience to God.

Alyattes, king of Lydia, treated the people of Miletus in exactly the same way, leaving their houses un-destroyed, solely that they might be tempted to return to them, and plough and sow once more (Herod. i. 17). The same thing goes on to this day. The wretched Fellahin, neglected and oppressed by the effete and corrupt Turkish Government, sow their corn, with the constant dread that they are but sowing it for the Bedouin, who yearly plunder them, unrepressed and unpunished. Hence the squalid towns and villages of the Fellahin abound in huge subterranean places of concealment, in which they stow away their corn, and everything else of value which they possess, to save them from these wild marauders.<p><span class= "bld">The Amalekites.</span>--See <a href="/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Judges 3:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-12.htm" title="And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.">Genesis 36:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The children of the east.</span>--Beni Kedem (<a href="/genesis/25-6.htm" title="But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.">Genesis 25:6</a>; <a href="/job/1-3.htm" title="His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.">Job 1:3</a>) is a general name for Arabs, as Josephus rightly calls them.

Comparing the analogous phrases, "the east country" (<a href="/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>), the mountains of the east (<a href="/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>), "the men of the east" (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>), "the east" (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>), we gather that the country lying to the east of Palestine as far as the river Euphrates was called the east country, and that the various tribes of Arabs and others who peopled that desert were called "the children of the cast" (see ver. 33 and <a href="/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whenever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">would plant their crops,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;ra&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2232.htm">Strong's 2232: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sow, to disseminate, plant, fructify</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Midianites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1447;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7695;&#183;y&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4080.htm">Strong's 4080: </a> </span><span class="str2">Midian -- a son of Abraham and Keturah, also his descendants and the region where they settled </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Amalekites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1435;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
