Previously, God had promised to drive out the Canaanite nations before Israel (<a href="/exodus/23-30.htm">Exodus 23:30-31</a>). The Israelites' disobedience and failure to fully follow God's commands led to this change. This reflects the conditional nature of God's promises, where blessings are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). Theologically, it underscores the importance of faithfulness in maintaining God's favor.<p><b>any of the nations</b><br>The "nations" refer to the various Canaanite tribes inhabiting the Promised Land, such as the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (<a href="/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>). These groups were known for their idolatrous practices, which posed a spiritual threat to Israel. The presence of these nations would test Israel's faithfulness to God and adherence to His laws (<a href="/judges/2-22.htm">Judges 2:22</a>). Historically, these nations were advanced in agriculture and trade, which could have been tempting for the Israelites to assimilate.<p><b>Joshua left when he died</b><br>Joshua, the successor of Moses, led the Israelites into the Promised Land and initiated the conquest of Canaan. However, not all territories were conquered by the time of his death (<a href="/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13:1</a>). This incomplete conquest left Israel vulnerable to the influence of the remaining Canaanite nations. Joshua's leadership is often seen as a type of Christ, leading God's people into the promised inheritance. His death marks a transition to a period of decentralized leadership, where the tribes were responsible for their own territories, leading to the cyclical pattern of sin and redemption seen throughout the Book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking in this verse, expressing His decision regarding the nations left in Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.
