Hospitality was a significant social duty, often involving extended visits. This extended stay also reflects the father's desire to ensure the well-being and safety of his daughter and her husband.<p><b>he got up early in the morning to depart</b><br>Rising early to travel was common in ancient times to avoid the heat of the day. This phrase indicates the Levite's intention to leave promptly, possibly due to a sense of urgency or responsibility. Early departure is also seen in other biblical narratives, such as Abraham's early rising in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, indicating a readiness to fulfill one's duty.<p><b>but the girl&#8217;s father said, &#8220;Please refresh your heart.&#8221;</b><br>The father&#8217;s request to "refresh your heart" is an invitation to rest and eat, reflecting the cultural emphasis on hospitality and care for guests. This phrase underscores the father's persistent hospitality, which can be seen as both genuine concern and a possible reluctance to let his daughter leave. The heart in biblical terms often refers to the center of one's being, including emotions and will, suggesting a holistic refreshment.<p><b>So they waited until late afternoon</b><br>The delay until "late afternoon" shows the father's success in persuading the Levite to stay longer. This waiting period may symbolize the tension between duty and hospitality. The late afternoon departure would have been risky due to the dangers of traveling at night, highlighting the narrative's underlying tension and foreshadowing the subsequent events.<p><b>and the two of them ate</b><br>The act of eating together signifies fellowship and agreement. In biblical culture, sharing a meal was a sign of peace and relationship. This meal could be seen as a final act of hospitality before the Levite's departure, emphasizing the father's care and the social customs of the time. Eating together is a recurring theme in Scripture, often symbolizing unity and covenant, as seen in the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine.

The storyteller is emphasizing the persistence of delay. In Scripture, repeated postponements often foreshadow trouble (cf. <a href="/genesis/19-16.htm">Genesis 19:16</a>, where Lot &#8220;lingered&#8221; and danger closed in). The fifth-day notation alerts us that time is slipping away and that moral compromise is creeping in during Israel&#8217;s leaderless era (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He got up early in the morning to depart</b><p>Rising early signals good intent and diligence (<a href="/psalms/57-8.htm">Psalm 57:8</a>; <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>). The Levite knows he should be heading toward Ephraim and ultimately Shiloh, closer to the Lord&#8217;s sanctuary. Yet desire to do right is not enough; follow-through matters (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). His early start contrasts with his repeated surrender to delay&#8212;an illustration of flesh winning over resolve.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the girl&#8217;s father said, &#8220;Please refresh your heart.&#8221;</b><p>The father&#8217;s invitation sounds hospitable, echoing Abraham urging travelers to rest and eat (<a href="/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>). Hospitality is commendable (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>); however, here it enables procrastination. <a href="/proverbs/25-17.htm">Proverbs 25:17</a> warns, &#8220;Seldom set foot in your neighbor&#8217;s house&#8212;lest he become weary of you.&#8221; The father&#8217;s motive may mix genuine kindness with reluctance to release his daughter, exposing the blurred boundaries common in Judges.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they waited until late afternoon</b><p>Each delay pushes the travellers closer to nightfall, when roads were dangerous (<a href="/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9-10</a>). Late afternoon departure would leave limited daylight for the trek toward the hill country of Ephraim. The decision disregards wisdom like <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, failing to recognize that there is &#8220;a time to depart.&#8221; Spiritually, it pictures Israel lingering in compromise until moral darkness descends.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the two of them ate.</b><p>Shared meals cement relationships (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>). Yet eating here seals another postponement. Instead of strengthening them for righteous travel, the meal becomes part of a pattern leading to disaster in Gibeah (<a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22-30</a>). Good gifts, misused, can become snares (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7-8</a>). The text implicitly warns that even ordinary choices&#8212;when repeatedly surrendered to convenience&#8212;can open doors to grievous sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/19-8.htm">Judges 19:8</a> captures a small, seemingly benign decision: another meal, another delay. Taken literally, it shows hospitality and travel plans. Taken to heart, it exposes a spiritual drift&#8212;good intentions undermined by continual postponement. Repeated compromise erodes discernment, leaving God&#8217;s people vulnerable to deeper darkness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And they tarried until afternoon.</span>--The verb is perhaps an imperative: <span class= "ital">and linger </span>(as in Isa.
