Balak is known for hiring Balaam to curse Israel (Numbers 22-24). The rhetorical question implies a comparison between the current Ammonite king and Balak, suggesting that even Balak, who had significant reasons to oppose Israel, did not engage in direct conflict. This highlights the perceived arrogance or presumption of the Ammonite king. Historically, Moab and Ammon were neighboring nations east of the Jordan River, often in conflict with Israel. The mention of Balak serves as a reminder of God's protection over Israel, as Balak's plans were thwarted by divine intervention.<p><b>Did he ever contend with Israel or fight against them?</b><br>This question emphasizes that Balak, despite his enmity, did not engage in open warfare with Israel. Instead, he sought to undermine them through spiritual means by hiring Balaam. The implication is that the current conflict with the Ammonites is unnecessary and unjustified. The historical context shows that Moab and Ammon had complex relationships with Israel, often marked by both conflict and coexistence. This phrase also underscores the theme of divine protection and guidance for Israel, as seen in the story of Balaam, where God turned curses into blessings. The rhetorical nature of the question serves to challenge the legitimacy of the Ammonite king's claims and actions against Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and vow, who is addressing the king of the Ammonites in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak_son_of_zippor.htm">Balak son of Zippor</a></b><br>The king of Moab who, during the time of the Exodus, sought to curse Israel through Balaam but did not engage in direct conflict.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A people group east of the Jordan River, descendants of Lot, who are in conflict with Israel over land disputes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A neighboring nation to Israel, also descendants of Lot, historically related to the Ammonites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, led by Jephthah in this account, who are defending their right to the land given by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_context_and_diplomacy.htm">Historical Context and Diplomacy</a></b><br>Jephthah uses historical precedent to argue for peace, showing the importance of understanding history and using it wisely in conflict resolution.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>The reference to Balak underscores God's protection over Israel, reminding believers of God's faithfulness and sovereignty in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_divine_boundaries.htm">Respect for Divine Boundaries</a></b><br>Just as Israel respected Moab's boundaries, Christians are called to respect others' boundaries and trust in God's provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peacemaking_efforts.htm">Peacemaking Efforts</a></b><br>Jephthah's approach to the Ammonite king exemplifies the biblical principle of seeking peace before engaging in conflict.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Jephthah's confidence in addressing the Ammonite king reflects a deep trust in God's promises and past faithfulness, encouraging believers to stand firm in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_11_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 11:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_11_25_Context_in_disputes.htm">How does Judges 11:25 illustrate the importance of historical context in disputes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Jephthah_s_conflict_resolution.htm">What lessons can we learn from Jephthah's approach to conflict resolution in Judges 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Judges_11_25_Jesus_on_peace_link.htm">How does Judges 11:25 connect with Jesus' teachings on peace and reconciliation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Use_Jephthah_s_diplomacy_in_conflicts.htm">How can we apply Jephthah's diplomatic approach to conflicts in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/History_s_role_in_resolving_conflicts.htm">What role does understanding history play in resolving modern-day conflicts, as seen in Judges 11:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Judges_11_25_Divine_justice_challenge.htm">How does Judges 11:25 challenge the concept of divine justice in biblical narratives?

The verse affirms the reliability of the biblical record, God&#8217;s sovereign distribution of territories, and the futility of opposing His declared will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Art thou anything better than Balak?</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Are you the good, good in comparison with? </span>It is one of the Hebrew ways of expressing the superlative.

If the territory in question was Moabite property, bow came it that Balak laid no claim to it? He was an enemy of the Israelites, and yet when Israel took possession of the land, and dwelt in Heshbon, its capital, and the daughter cities or villages thereof, and in Aroer and her daughter cities or villages, and in all the cities on the banks of the Amen, Balak never strove about them with Israel, or went to war to recover them - a plain proof that he did not look upon them as his property. If they were his, that was the time to claim and recover them, but he had not done so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/11-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Are you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
