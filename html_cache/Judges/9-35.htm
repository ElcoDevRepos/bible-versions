Yet human plans apart from God cannot stand (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-10.htm">Isaiah 8:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His movement outside the city signals the beginning of open conflict; he is no longer merely talking (<a href="/judges/9-28.htm">Judges 9:28-29</a>) but ready to face Abimelech.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the entrance of the city gate</b><p>&#8226; The gate was the hub of civic life&#8212;commerce, justice, leadership (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>). By positioning himself here, Gaal asserts rulership over Shechem.<p>&#8226; This location also makes him visible to the populace, aiming to rally support, yet exposing him to danger.

Gaal proudly positions himself at Shechem&#8217;s gate, seeking authority God never granted. Simultaneously, Abimelech emerges from concealment, the very tool God uses to discipline both Gaal and the city that embraced rebellion. The verse reminds us that human ambition outside God&#8217;s will inevitably collides with His sovereign plans, and every word of Scripture&#8212;prophetic or historical&#8212;stands confirmed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Stood in the entering of the gate of the city.</span>--This was the ordinary station of kings, judges, &c.; but Gaal only seems to have gone there in order to keep a look-out (<a href="/joshua/20-4.htm" title="And when he that does flee to one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.">Joshua 20:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Gaal</span>, etc. It does not appear certain whether Gaal, who, as is clear from ver. 36, was accompanied by Zebul, went out of the city gate with his men in consequence of any intelligence of Abimelech's movements, or any alarm or suspicion of danger, or merely upon some other enterprise. But whatever the cause was, as soon as he was there, Abimelech, according to Zebul's advice in ver. 33, had begun to descend from the mountains into the valley to "set upon the city."
