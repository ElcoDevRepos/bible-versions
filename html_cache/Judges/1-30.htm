However, they did not fully obey God's command to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants. This failure is part of a recurring theme in Judges, where the Israelites do not completely conquer the land as instructed in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>. Kitron and Nahalol are locations within Zebulun's territory, though their exact locations are uncertain today. This failure to drive out the inhabitants reflects a lack of faith and obedience, which would lead to spiritual and cultural compromise.<p><b>so the Canaanites lived among them</b><br>The presence of Canaanites among the Israelites led to significant challenges. The Canaanites were known for their idolatrous practices, which often enticed the Israelites away from worshiping Yahweh alone. This coexistence is a direct violation of God's command to separate from the pagan nations (<a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32-33</a>). The Israelites' failure to remove these influences foreshadows the cycle of sin and repentance that characterizes the Book of Judges. It also highlights the danger of spiritual complacency and the importance of complete obedience to God's commands.<p><b>and served as forced laborers.</b><br>Instead of driving out the Canaanites, the Israelites subjected them to forced labor. This decision reflects a pragmatic approach rather than a faithful one, as they sought to benefit economically from the Canaanites' presence. This arrangement is reminiscent of the Israelites' own experience in Egypt, where they were subjected to forced labor (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>). The use of forced labor indicates a partial obedience to God's command, which often leads to further disobedience and compromise. This situation also prefigures the Israelites' later struggles with idolatry and assimilation into Canaanite culture, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebulun.htm">Zebulun</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's son Zebulun.
