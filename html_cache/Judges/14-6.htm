The Spirit of the LORD coming upon someone signifies God's direct intervention and empowerment for a specific task. In the Old Testament, this empowerment is often temporary and task-specific, unlike the New Testament indwelling of the Holy Spirit. This divine empowerment is seen in other judges like Othniel (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>) and Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>). It highlights God's sovereignty and ability to use flawed individuals for His purposes.<p><b>and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands</b><br>This act of strength is reminiscent of the feats of other biblical figures like David, who also killed a lion (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>). The lion, a symbol of power and danger, represents challenges that can only be overcome through divine strength. Samson's victory over the lion foreshadows his role as a deliverer of Israel, albeit a flawed one. This act also prefigures Christ's victory over sin and death, as lions are often symbolic of evil forces in Scripture (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>as one would tear a young goat</b><br>This simile emphasizes the ease with which Samson defeated the lion, underscoring the extraordinary nature of his strength. In ancient Near Eastern culture, tearing a young goat was a task that required strength but was not impossible, suggesting that Samson's feat was supernaturally enabled. This imagery also connects to sacrificial practices, where goats were common offerings, hinting at themes of sacrifice and deliverance.<p><b>But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done</b><br>Samson's decision to keep this event secret may indicate a personal struggle or a lack of understanding of his calling. It reflects a pattern in Samson's life of acting independently and often impulsively. This secrecy contrasts with the transparency expected in a covenant relationship with God, highlighting Samson's complex character. It also sets the stage for future events where his actions lead to significant consequences, paralleling the hidden nature of sin and its eventual revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

Benaiah&#8217;s lion-slaying in <a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Parallel: David&#8217;s defense of his flock from lion and bear (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-37</a>) illustrates the same truth&#8212;God&#8217;s anointed can face overwhelming danger in His strength.<p>&#8226; This event initiates Samson&#8217;s series of personal victories that foreshadow Israel&#8217;s larger deliverance (<a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As one would tear a young goat</b><p>&#8226; The comparison highlights ease: in the culture of the time, preparing a young goat for food was routine.<p>&#8226; By likening the lion to a goat, the text emphasizes how completely God&#8217;s power eclipses natural obstacles (cf. <a href="/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>, &#8220;You will tread on the lion and cobra&#8221;).<p>&#8226; It also sets up the later riddle about the honey in the lion&#8217;s carcass (<a href="/judges/14-14.htm">Judges 14:14</a>), turning a moment of danger into a testimony of God&#8217;s provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done</b><p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s silence may reflect:<p>&#8211; Personal secrecy common to his narrative (<a href="/judges/14-9.htm">Judges 14:9</a>; 16:17).<p>&#8211; Awareness that touching a carcass violated his Nazirite separation (<a href="/numbers/6-6.htm">Numbers 6:6-8</a>); he shields his parents from defilement or disappointment.<p>&#8211; A pattern of acting alone, contrasting with later judges who rallied Israel (cf. Deborah in <a href="/bsb/judges/4.htm">Judges 4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar discretion appears in Mary pondering events &#8220;in her heart&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>), underscoring that not every divine encounter must be broadcast.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a> records a literal, Spirit-empowered victory. God&#8217;s Spirit rushes upon Samson, granting supernatural strength; the lion falls as effortlessly as a butchered goat, displaying God&#8217;s supremacy over creation and threats. Samson&#8217;s quiet concealment foreshadows both his complex character and the greater deliverance God will achieve through him. For believers, the verse affirms that when God calls, He supplies power, often in sudden, overwhelming measure, inviting humble reliance on the Spirit rather than on human ability.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The Spirit of the Lord.</span>--Implying here an access of courage and strength.
