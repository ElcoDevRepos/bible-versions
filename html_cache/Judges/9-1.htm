Gideon was a judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory over the Midianites.

It was a city of refuge and a place of covenant renewal for the Israelites. The city had a mixed population of Israelites and Canaanites, which may have influenced Abimelech's strategy. By going to his maternal relatives, Abimelech seeks to leverage familial ties to gain support for his political ambitions. This reflects the importance of kinship and tribal affiliations in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>and said to them and to all the clan of his mother</b><br>Abimelech's approach to his mother's family indicates a strategic move to consolidate power through familial connections. In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, maternal ties were often secondary to paternal lineage, yet Abimelech capitalizes on these connections to further his cause. This action highlights the complex social dynamics and the role of family loyalty in political maneuvers.

The verse shows how personal ambition, mixed loyalties, and selective family alliances can steer an entire community, setting up the tragedy that follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And Abimelech.</span>--This narrative of the rise and fall of Abimelech, "the bramble king," is singularly vivid in many of its details, while at the same time material facts are so briefly touched upon that parts of the story must remain obscure. The general bearing of this graphic episode is to illustrate the slow, but certain, working of Divine retribution. The two main faults of the last phase of Gideon's career had been his polygamy and his dangerous tampering with unauthorised, if not idolatrous, worship. The retribution for both errors falls on his house. The agents of their overthrow are the kinsmen of his base-born son by a Canaanite mother. Abimelech seems to have taken his first steps very soon after Gideon's death. Doubtless he had long been secretly maturing his plans. The narrative bears on its surface inimitable marks of truthfulness. We can trace in the character of Abimelech a reflection of his father's courage and promptitude, overshadowed by elements which he must have drawn from his maternal origin.<p><span class= "bld">Unto his mother's brethren.</span>--His Canaanite kith and kin, who doubtless had great influence over the still powerful aboriginal element of the Shechemite population.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The son of Jerubbaal</span>. Throughout this chapter Gideon is spoken of by the name of Jerubbaal. There must be some cause for this. The simplest and most probable cause is that this whole history of Abimelech is taken from some other source than the preceding chapters. And a considerable difference in the style of the narrative, which is feebler and more obscure, seems to bear out this inference. <span class="cmt_word">Went to Shechem</span>. This revolt from the house of Gideon in favour of Abimelech seems to partake of the nature of an Ephraimite rising against the supremacy of Manasseh. It was doubtless galling to the pride of the great tribe of Ephraim (<a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1-6</a>) that Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites should be the seat of government, and Gideon's ephod the centre of religion for the tribes of Israel. And so they seem to have taken advantage of Gideon's death, and of Abimelech's connection with Shechem, to make a league with the Hivite inhabitants of Shechem (see vers. 27, 28) to set up Abimelech as king, and to restore the worship of Baal, under the title of Baal-berith (<a href="/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33</a>; <a href="/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4, 27, 46</a>), at Shechem for all Israel to resort to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Abimelech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1462;&#1444;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_40.htm">Strong's 40: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abimelech -- 'father is king', a Philistine name, also an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jerubbaal</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;rub&#183;ba&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3378.htm">Strong's 3378: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jerubbaal -- 'let Baal contend', a name of Gideon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
