The curse pronounced by the angel of the LORD, a divine messenger often associated with God's direct intervention, underscores the seriousness of Meroz's failure. In biblical context, curses are significant and denote divine disfavor, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27-28</a>. The angel of the LORD appears in various Old Testament passages, often as a theophany, suggesting a direct communication from God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a> and <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>.<p><b>&#8216;Bitterly curse her inhabitants;</b><br>The repetition of the curse emphasizes the gravity of the offense. Inhabitants of Meroz are singled out for their inaction, which is seen as a betrayal of their covenantal duty to support God's people. This reflects the communal responsibility in Israelite society, where collective action was often necessary for survival and success. The bitterness of the curse suggests a deep-seated disappointment and anger, akin to the curses found in <a href="/jeremiah/48-10.htm">Jeremiah 48:10</a> against those who do not do the LORD's work with zeal.<p><b>for they did not come to help the LORD,</b><br>The phrase implies that aiding Israel in battle was equivalent to helping the LORD, highlighting the theocratic nature of Israel where God was seen as the ultimate leader and king. This concept is echoed in <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>, where David declares that the battle is the LORD's. The failure of Meroz to assist is seen as a direct affront to God Himself, illustrating the expectation of loyalty and support among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>to help the LORD against the mighty.&#8217;</b><br>The "mighty" refers to the Canaanite forces led by Sisera, who were oppressing Israel. The call to help against such formidable foes underscores the need for unity and courage among God's people. This phrase also reflects the biblical theme of God using the weak to overcome the strong, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>. The expectation was that all of Israel would rally to God's cause, as seen in the collective efforts during the conquest of Canaan in Joshua. The failure of Meroz serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of neglecting one's duty to God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/meroz.htm">Meroz</a></b><br>A location mentioned only in this verse, whose inhabitants are cursed for not aiding in the battle against Sisera.

This underlines that the curse is not mere human frustration but a decree from heaven.<p>- In Scripture, when the Angel of the LORD speaks, it carries the full weight of God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness and holiness (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13-15</a>).<p>- The city of Meroz had witnessed God&#8217;s miraculous victory over Sisera yet remained indifferent. Their neutrality placed them in direct opposition to God&#8217;s purposes&#8212;echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>, &#8220;If you do not obey the LORD your God, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you&#8221;.<p>- God&#8217;s people are never spectators in His redemptive work; by standing aloof, Meroz effectively opposed the Lord Himself, earning divine censure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Bitterly curse her inhabitants;</b><p>- The double emphasis (&#8220;curse&#8230; bitterly curse&#8221;) highlights the seriousness of their neglect. God&#8217;s rebuke is intensified because they were covenant people who knew better.<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/48-10.htm">Jeremiah 48:10</a> warns, &#8220;Cursed is he who is negligent in doing the work of the LORD&#8221;. Meroz illustrates this principle in real time.<p>- God&#8217;s anger is not arbitrary; it is the just response to willful apathy in the face of revealed duty. Those who ignore His call share the guilt of the enemy they refuse to resist.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for they did not come to help the LORD,</b><p>- The sin is omission, not commission. <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a> states, &#8220;Whoever knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of sin&#8221;.<p>- Contrasted within the same song, &#8220;Zebulun was a people who risked their lives; Naphtali also on the heights of the battlefield&#8221; (<a href="/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>). Obedient tribes receive honor; negligent Meroz receives a curse.<p>- The Lord graciously invites His people into His victories. Refusing that invitation is tantamount to refusing Him (<a href="/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to help the LORD against the mighty.&#8217;</b><p>- The battle against Sisera&#8217;s iron chariots looked formidable, yet it was the Lord&#8217;s war: &#8220;The battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>).<p>- When believers rally to God&#8217;s cause, He fights for them (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-8.htm">2 Chronicles 32:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). When they stand aside, they separate themselves from His protection and blessing.<p>- Spiritual battles today remain the Lord&#8217;s (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12-13</a>). Participation is a privilege; neglect invites discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/5-23.htm">Judges 5:23</a> exposes the peril of passive disobedience. Meroz, fully aware of God&#8217;s call to stand with Deborah and Barak, chose comfort over commitment. The Angel of the LORD therefore pronounces a bitter curse, underscoring that neutrality in God&#8217;s kingdom is never neutral. Faithful obedience brings honor and victory; indifference aligns us with the enemy and invites judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Curse ye Meroz.</span>--The guilt of Meroz was worse than that of the tribes which held aloof, because, whatever may have been its exact site, it was evidently in the very heart of the country which had been thus inspired to strike a blow for freedom. Possibly it would have been in the power of the inhabitants at least to cut off the retreat of the enemy. We may conjecture, from the ban thus laid on Meroz, that it felt the vengeance of the victorious Israelites, and was destroyed or punished like Succoth and Penuel. Their crime was <span class= "ital">detrectatio militiae, </span>which the ancients regarded with special indignation. The case of Jabesh Gilead, in <a href="/context/judges/21-9.htm" title="For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.">Judges 21:9-10</a>, may account for the difficulty of ascertaining the site of the town; it is not mentioned elsewhere. By some it is identified with Kefr Musr, a village to the south of Tabor (5 Raumer); by others with Marussus, north of Bethshean. It has been conjectured that the true reading may be Merom, and Dr. Thomson identifies it with Marom, as Eusebius alludes to it under the name Merran, and Jerome calls it Merrom. They, however, place it near Dothan, twelve miles from Shechem--a very unlikely locality.<p><span class= "bld">Said the angel of the Lord.</span>--The <span class= "ital">Maleak Jehovah, </span>as in <a href="/judges/3-1.htm" title="Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;">Judges 3:1</a>.
