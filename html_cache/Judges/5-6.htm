His mention here suggests a time of oppression and instability in Israel. The name "Anath" may refer to a Canaanite goddess, indicating possible cultural influences or syncretism during this period. This era was marked by a lack of centralized leadership, as Israel was ruled by judges rather than kings.<p><b>in the days of Jael</b><br>Jael is celebrated in <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4 and 5</a> for her role in killing Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite army, with a tent peg. Her actions are seen as divinely inspired, contributing to Israel's victory. The mention of Jael alongside Shamgar highlights the significant roles played by individuals, including women, in God's deliverance of Israel. This period was characterized by God using unexpected people to achieve His purposes.<p><b>the highways were deserted</b><br>This phrase indicates a time of fear and danger, where normal travel and commerce were disrupted due to threats from enemy forces or bandits. The deserted highways symbolize the breakdown of societal order and security, reflecting the consequences of Israel's disobedience and idolatry. This situation is reminiscent of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for turning away from God.<p><b>and the travelers took the byways</b><br>Travelers avoiding main roads suggests a strategy to evade danger, indicating a period of oppression and insecurity. This behavior reflects the broader theme of Judges, where Israel repeatedly falls into sin, leading to oppression by surrounding nations. The use of byways instead of highways can symbolize the need for God's people to find alternative paths to safety and deliverance, often through unexpected means or people, as seen in the stories of Shamgar and Jael.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shamgar_son_of_anath.htm">Shamgar son of Anath</a></b><br>A judge of Israel mentioned briefly in <a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>.

Yet the mention here suggests that even after his victory, national security remained fragile.<p>&#8226; The pattern of the period&#8212;sin, oppression, crying out, deliverance (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>)&#8212;is on display again.

Her boldness echoes Deborah&#8217;s prophecy (<a href="/judges/4-9.htm">Judges 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By placing Jael&#8217;s name alongside Shamgar&#8217;s, the song highlights that deliverance sometimes comes through unexpected instruments. Compare <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>, where David confesses that &#8220;the battle belongs to the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Both Shamgar and Jael stood firm when others hesitated, illustrating how individual obedience can shift an entire nation&#8217;s fortunes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the highways were deserted</b><p>&#8226; Under Canaanite oppression (<a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>), main roads were unsafe. <a href="/2_chronicles/15-5.htm">2 Chronicles 15:5-6</a> speaks of a similar era: &#8220;No one could travel safely, for great turmoil was on all the inhabitants of the lands&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Vacant highways meant commerce stalled, communication broke, and worship at the tabernacle waned (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>&#8217;s call for pilgrimage).<p>&#8226; God had promised peace for obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>), so deserted roads signaled covenant breach and divine discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the travelers took the byways</b><p>&#8226; Fear forced ordinary people onto winding, hidden paths. <a href="/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a> observes, &#8220;The highways are deserted, no travelers are on the road&#8221;, linking moral collapse with social breakdown.<p>&#8226; Taking byways implies constant vigilance, detours, and delay&#8212;life in survival mode. <a href="/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a> pictures Zion&#8217;s roads mourning because &#8220;no one comes to the appointed feasts&#8221;.<p>&#8226; When open, public life shuts down, God&#8217;s people cannot flourish.

The verse reminds us that without faithful leadership and covenant loyalty, a nation&#8217;s daily life unravels. Yet God raises deliverers&#8212;sometimes unlikely ones&#8212;to restore peace and reopen the highways for His people&#8217;s worship, work, and fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">In the days of Shamgar.</span>--In this and the two next verses is described the misery and dejection of Israel; and the names of Shamgar and Jael are mentioned to enhance the glory of Deborah, by showing that even the presence among the Israelites of two such heroic souls as Shamgar and Jael was unavailing to deliver them until Deborah arose. That Shamgar is thus (apparently) alluded to as a contemporary of Jael has an important bearing on the chronology; for it at least shows that simultaneous struggles may have been going on against the Philistines in the south and the Canaanites in the north.<p><span class= "bld">In the days of Jael.</span>--It has been thought so strange that Deborah should mention the name of the Bedouin chieftainess as marking the epoch, that some have supposed "Jael" to be the name of some unknown judge; and some have even proposed to read Jair. Others render it "the helper," and suppose that Ehud, or Shamgar, is referred to. But (1) Jael is essentially a woman's name (see <a href="/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Judges 4:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-19.htm" title="Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and be you ravished always with her love.">Proverbs 5:19</a>); (2) she is mentioned prominently in this very song as having put the finishing stroke to the victory of Israel; and (3) she may have been--and various incidents in the history lead us to suppose that she was--a woman of great importance and influence, even independently of her murder of Sisera.<p><span class= "bld">The highways were unoccupied.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">kept holiday. </span>This had been foretold in <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm" title="I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.">Leviticus 26:22</a>.
