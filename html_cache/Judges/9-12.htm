The grapevine, or vine, is symbolic of fruitfulness and abundance, often associated with Israel itself (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>). The vine is a plant that requires support, indicating a need for cooperation and community. This request reflects the people's desire for a leader who can provide prosperity and stability, much like the vine provides sustenance through its fruit.<p><b>&#8216;Come and reign over us.&#8217;</b><br>This plea for leadership highlights the Israelites' desire for a king, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The request for the vine to reign suggests a longing for a ruler who embodies the qualities of fruitfulness and blessing. This foreshadows Israel's later demand for a king in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a>, which ultimately leads to the anointing of Saul. Theologically, this reflects humanity's tendency to seek earthly leaders rather than relying on God's sovereignty. The vine's response in the following verses emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's God-given purpose rather than seeking power for its own sake.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trees.htm">The Trees</a></b><br>In this parable, the trees represent the people of Shechem seeking a leader.

Both declined. Turning to the vine shows the trees lowering their standards step-by-step.<p>- In Israel, the vine is prized for its fruit but fragile without a support. It illustrates productivity yet dependency (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a> &#8220;You brought a vine out of Egypt&#8230;&#8221;).<p>- God later calls His covenant people a vineyard that should bear good grapes (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-4</a>). By aiming at the vine, the trees seek fruitfulness, not necessarily righteousness.<p>- New-Testament light: Jesus declares, &#8220;I am the true vine&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>). Israel&#8217;s leaders were reaching for fruit that only the Lord Himself would finally supply.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come</b><p>- The invitation sounds warm, even flattering, but it is also manipulative: &#8220;Fill our need; satisfy our agenda.&#8221;<p>- Throughout Scripture, God warns against rushing after visible solutions before consulting Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p>- Discipleship truth: God calls His people to come to Him first (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).

Yet fallen hearts keep outsourcing sovereignty.<p>- Israel had tried this before with Gideon: &#8220;Rule over us&#8221; (<a href="/judges/8-22.htm">Judges 8:22</a>). Gideon answered rightly, &#8220;The LORD will rule over you&#8221; (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>).<p>- The grapevine answers later in verse 13, refusing the crown. Even a plant in a fable knows it would lose its purpose by trading fruitfulness for power.<p>- The lesson echoes <a href="/1_samuel/8-19.htm">1 Samuel 8:19-20</a>, where Israel insists, &#8220;We want a king.&#8221; God allowed their demand, but the cost was heavy taxation, conscription, and spiritual drift.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Each phrase in <a href="/judges/9-12.htm">Judges 9:12</a> exposes the restless human impulse to seek leadership apart from God.
