Jair is identified as a Gileadite, suggesting his origin from the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. This area was known for its rugged terrain and was part of the territory allotted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The mention of Jair as a Gileadite highlights the tribal and regional diversity among the judges of Israel. Gilead was a significant location in biblical history, often associated with balm and healing, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>. Jair's leadership from this region may imply a role in unifying the tribes across the Jordan.<p><b>who judged Israel twenty-two years</b><br>Jair's tenure as a judge lasted twenty-two years, indicating a period of relative stability and peace under his leadership. The role of a judge in Israel was not only judicial but also military and spiritual, serving as a leader who delivered Israel from oppression and guided them in following God's laws. The length of Jair's judgeship suggests he was effective in maintaining order and addressing the needs of the Israelites during his time. This period of leadership without mention of significant conflict or oppression may reflect a time of obedience to God, contrasting with the cyclical pattern of sin and deliverance seen throughout the Book of Judges. Jair's long judgeship can be compared to other judges like Deborah and Gideon, who also brought peace to Israel for extended periods.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jair.htm">Jair</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who arose after Tola.

This earlier Jair, with Nobah, plays a splendid part in Jewish legend, which is only alluded to in Scripture (see <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>). In what relation the Jair of these verses stood to him we cannot, in the uncertain data of the chronology, decide. The Jair of <a href="/numbers/32-41.htm" title="And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.">Numbers 32:41</a> was descended from Judah on the father's side, and on the mother's was a great-grandson of Manasseh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jair</span>. We read of Jair the son of Segub, the son of Machir's daughter by Hezron, in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21-23</a>, and are there told that he had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead (called Havoth-jair), which were included in the territory of the sons of Machir. The same information is given in <a href="/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40-42</a>, and in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14, 15</a>, in both which passages Jair is styled the son of Manasseh, and is stated to have called the cities after his own name, Havoth-jair. In the present verse we are also told that Jair the judge was a Gileadite, and that he had thirty sons who had thirty cities in Gilead called Havoth-jair. The question arises, Can these two be the same person? If they are, <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> must be a later parenthetical insertion, as it has very much the appearance of being. The notice in <a href="/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a> must also refer to later times than those of Moses, and we must understand the statement in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>, that "Segub begat Jair," as meaning that he was his lineal ancestor, just as in <a href="/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8</a> we read that "Joram begat Ozias," though three generations intervened between them. If, on the other hand, they are not the same, we must suppose that Jair in our text was a descendant of the other Jair, and may compare the double explanation of the name Havoth-jair with the double explanation of <span class="accented">Beer-sheba</span> given <a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-31.htm">Genesis 26:31-33</a>; the threefold explanation of the name Isaac, <a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>; <a href="/genesis/21-6.htm">Genesis 21:6</a>; and the double explanation of the proverb, "Is Saul among the prophets?" given in <a href="/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11, 12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23, 24</a>.
