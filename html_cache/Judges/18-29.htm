This act of renaming signifies possession and identity, reflecting the tribe's desire to establish a lasting legacy in the Promised Land. Naming places after patriarchs was a common practice, reinforcing tribal heritage and continuity.<p><b>after their forefather Dan</b><br>Dan was the fifth son of Jacob (Israel) and the first son of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant. The tribe of Dan was known for its struggles to secure territory, as seen in <a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>, where they were initially unable to drive out the Amorites. This renaming symbolizes a successful conquest and fulfillment of their inheritance.<p><b>who was born to Israel</b><br>The mention of Israel (Jacob) highlights the covenantal relationship between God and the patriarchs. It underscores the divine promise given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land and their descendants. This connection to Israel emphasizes the legitimacy of the tribe's claim to the land.<p><b>though the city was formerly named Laish</b><br>Laish was a Canaanite city, known for its peaceful and secure lifestyle, as described earlier in <a href="/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>. The renaming from Laish to Dan marks a significant cultural and religious shift, as the city transitions from Canaanite to Israelite control.

Leah&#8217;s sister Rachel exclaimed, &#8220;God has judged me,&#8221; so the name &#8220;Dan&#8221; (meaning &#8220;judge&#8221;) became a living reminder of God&#8217;s justice in family matters.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/49-16.htm">Genesis 49:16-17</a> prophesies, &#8220;Dan shall provide justice for his people&#8221;. By naming the city after him, the tribe signaled its desire to fulfill that destiny in a new territory.<p>&#8226; The mention of ancestry roots the action in covenant history; they were not merely settlers but descendants of promises given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was born to Israel</b><p>The text clarifies that Dan &#8220;was born to Israel&#8221;&#8212;that is, to Jacob after God changed his name to Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase links the tribe&#8217;s present conquest to the patriarchal narrative. God&#8217;s faithfulness to Israel&#8217;s household extends to every generation (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting Dan&#8217;s birth to Israel, Scripture underscores legitimacy: the tribe&#8217;s identity flows from the God-given name &#8220;Israel,&#8221; tying their new home to the larger story of God&#8217;s chosen nation.<p>&#8226; It also reminds readers that national identity is not geographic first but covenantal; wherever the tribes dwell, they are still Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though the city was formerly named Laish</b><p>Finally, Scripture notes, &#8220;though the city was formerly named Laish.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Laish was a quiet, unsuspecting Phoenician-influenced town (<a href="/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>). Its previous name reflected Canaanite culture, but the Danites replaced that culture and name with their own.<p>&#8226; Renaming signified ownership and a new spiritual direction&#8212;comparable to how Jacob renamed Luz to Bethel in <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>.<p>&#8226; Yet the footnote exposes the darker side: <a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27-31</a> reveals the tribe quickly set up a carved image. While the name changed, their heart drifted, paving the way for future idolatry in Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, the verse affirms historical accuracy: archaeological references to &#8220;Tel Dan&#8221; today echo the Bible&#8217;s testimony, confirming Scripture&#8217;s reliability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a> records more than a cosmetic name change. It shows a tribe claiming territory, linking that claim to its patriarch Dan, grounding it in the covenant family of Israel, and replacing a Canaanite identity with an Israelite one. The verse testifies to God&#8217;s faithfulness to His people&#8217;s lineage, highlights their calling to administer justice, and foreshadows both opportunity and danger&#8212;victory under God&#8217;s banner, yet vulnerability to idolatry if they drift from Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">They called the name of the city Dan.</span>--Just as the Messenians changed the name Zankle into Messene.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit Laish was the name</span>, etc. The strange form here given in the Septuagint, <span class="accented">Oulamais</span>, arises from their having taken the Hebrew word for <span class="accented">howbeit</span> (<span class="accented">oulam</span>) as part of the name, and left out the L of Laish (see ver. 7, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/18-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They named</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
