The Israelites often turned away from Yahweh to worship the gods of the surrounding nations, such as Baal and Ashtoreth. This choice reflects a violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and demonstrates a lack of faithfulness to the covenant established at Sinai. The worship of new gods often led to moral and spiritual decline, as seen throughout the Book of Judges. This idolatry is a type of spiritual adultery, symbolizing Israel's unfaithfulness to God, which is a theme echoed by the prophets (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>).<p><b>then war came to their gates</b><br>The consequence of idolatry was often oppression by foreign powers, as God allowed Israel's enemies to prevail as a form of judgment (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14-15</a>). The phrase "war came to their gates" suggests that the conflict was not just on the battlefield but had reached the very heart of their communities, indicating a severe threat to their security and way of life. This reflects the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience would lead to military defeat and distress.<p><b>Not a shield or spear was found among forty thousand in Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the dire situation of Israel's military unpreparedness and vulnerability. The lack of weapons among forty thousand men suggests a period of disarmament or oppression, possibly enforced by their enemies to keep them subjugated. This situation is reminiscent of <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>, where the Philistines prevented the Israelites from having blacksmiths to make weapons. The absence of arms highlights Israel's dependence on God for deliverance, as seen in the victory led by Deborah and Barak, where God intervened miraculously (<a href="/judges/4-15.htm">Judges 4:15</a>). This reliance on divine intervention rather than human strength is a recurring theme in the narrative of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, who are experiencing turmoil due to their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel who, along with Barak, led Israel to victory over the Canaanite oppressors.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/barak.htm">Barak</a></b><br>The military leader who, under Deborah's guidance, led the Israelites to victory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The oppressors of Israel during this period, led by King Jabin and his commander Sisera.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/war_in_the_gates.htm">War in the Gates</a></b><br>A phrase indicating the presence of conflict and danger at the very heart of Israel's communities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Choosing new gods leads to vulnerability and conflict.

Scripture consistently warns that turning from the true God to false ones is spiritual adultery. &#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16&#8211;17</a> shows God promising to hide His face when Israel runs after other gods. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a> notes, &#8220;The sorrows of those who run after another god will multiply.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a> pictures Elijah asking, &#8220;How long will you waver between two opinions?&#8221; Idolatry never stays private; it reshapes a nation&#8217;s identity, priorities, and security.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then War Came to Their Gates</b><p>Deborah sings, &#8220;then war came to their gates&#8221; (<a href="/judges/5-8.htm">Judges 5:8</a> b). Idolatry made Israel vulnerable, and enemy armies pressed right up to city gates&#8212;places normally safeguarded by elders and soldiers (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). God had promised peace for obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>), yet warned of invasion for rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49&#8211;52</a>). The connection is unmistakable: forsaking God removes His protective hand. For modern readers, sin still opens doors the enemy gladly exploits (<a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26&#8211;27</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not a Shield or Spear Was Found</b><p>&#8220;Not a shield or spear was found&#8221; (<a href="/judges/5-8.htm">Judges 5:8</a> c). Israel lacked even basic weaponry, an echo of earlier oppression when Philistines banned blacksmiths (<a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19&#8211;22</a>). Disobedience leaves God&#8217;s people unarmed both physically and spiritually. Paul later urges believers to &#8220;put on the full armor of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>) because compromise strips the soul of defensive strength (<a href="/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9&#8211;10</a>).

Though forty thousand can symbolize a military contingent (<a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>), here it exposes collective failure&#8212;no pockets of resistance, no hidden reserves. <a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a> had warned that a new generation &#8220;knew neither the LORD nor what He had done.&#8221; By chapter 5, that ignorance has matured into helplessness. It illustrates <a href="/proverbs/29-18.htm">Proverbs 29:18</a> in action: &#8220;Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/judges/5-8.htm">Judges 5:8</a> traces a straight line: idolatry &#8594; invasion &#8594; impotence. Israel&#8217;s choice to replace God led to enemies at the gate and a disarmed populace. The verse cautions every believer that fidelity to the LORD is the surest defense, while spiritual compromise surrenders both peace and power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">They chose new gods.</span>--The Chaldee and the LXX. agree in this interpretation, which is strongly supported by <a href="/context/deuteronomy/32-16.htm" title="They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.">Deuteronomy 32:16-17</a>.
