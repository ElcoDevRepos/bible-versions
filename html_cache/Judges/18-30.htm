The Danites' actions reflect a departure from the worship of Yahweh, violating the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This idolatry is a symptom of the broader moral and spiritual decay during the period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The setting up of idols indicates a syncretism with Canaanite religious practices, which were prevalent in the region and often led the Israelites astray.<p><b>and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses</b><br>This phrase introduces Jonathan, a Levite, who is identified as a descendant of Moses. The mention of Moses' lineage is significant, as it contrasts the faithfulness of Moses with the unfaithfulness of his descendants. This connection underscores the theme of generational decline in spiritual fidelity. The use of "Moses" instead of "Manasseh" (as some manuscripts suggest) emphasizes the gravity of the situation, as it involves a direct descendant of Israel's greatest prophet and lawgiver participating in idolatry.<p><b>and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jonathan and his sons served as priests, despite the fact that the legitimate priesthood was to be from the line of Aaron (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). This unauthorized priesthood reflects the disorder and lack of adherence to God's law during this period. The tribe of Dan's establishment of their own priesthood further illustrates their separation from the central worship in Shiloh, where the tabernacle was located. This act of setting up their own religious system is a precursor to the later division of the kingdom and the establishment of rival worship centers in the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p><b>until the day of the captivity of the land</b><br>This phrase likely refers to the Assyrian captivity of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BC, which included the territory of Dan. The mention of captivity serves as a prophetic warning of the consequences of idolatry and disobedience to God. It highlights the eventual judgment that comes upon the people for their persistent unfaithfulness. This captivity is a fulfillment of the warnings given in the Mosaic Covenant, where God promised blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). The captivity serves as a historical marker of the end of this period of idolatry and the beginning of a new phase in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/danites.htm">Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel that settled in the northern part of the land.

In any case, it would make the inhabitants more ready to accept a cherubic symbol of Jehovah; for we may fairly assume that the "image" was not dissociated from the worship of God, whether as Elohim or Jehovah. Jonathan and the Danites both acknowledged Him under the name Elohim (<a href="/judges/18-5.htm" title="And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.">Judges 18:5</a>; <a href="/judges/18-10.htm" title="When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and to a large land: for God has given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.">Judges 18:10</a>), and Micah, in spite of his images, acknowledged God as Jehovah (<a href="/judges/17-2.htm" title="And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed, and spoke of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.

There is great diversity of opinion as to the meaning of this phrase. Many understand it, as is the obvious meaning of the words, of the Assyrian captivity (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). But some of the best commentators, as Kimchi among the Jews, and many moderns, think it refers to the taking captive of the ark by the Philistines in the days of Eli, because this is the time indicated in the next verse by the mention of the house of God in Shiloh. The ark of God never returned to Shiloh after it was taken thence (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3, 4</a>) and captured by the Philistines (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 11). It is also noticed that the expression, <span class="accented">The ark of God is gone into captivity</span> (is <span class="accented">taken</span>, A.V.), occurs in <a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21, 22</a>. It certainly would be strange that one verse (30) should speak of the worship of the graven image lasting till the Assyrian conquest of the land, and the next verse (31) limit it to the time that the house of God was in Shiloh, some 300 years earlier. At the same time it should be noticed that ver. 30 speaks of the time that Jonathan's sons were priests to the tribe of Dan, and ver. 31 of the worship of Micah's image. It is quite possible that the descendants of Jonathan may have been appointed priests at Dan to Jeroboam's golden-calf worship, though the original graven image of Micah may have been destroyed by Saul or David; and in the interval between such destruction of Micah's image and the setting up of Jeroboam's calves they may have been the priests of an irregular worship on a high place at Tell-el-Kady. And this would enable us to give what is certainly its natural meaning to the words, "the captivity of the land." But no certainty can be arrived at without more actual knowledge. Many commentators adopt Houbigant's conjecture to read <span class="accented">ark</span> for <span class="accented">land</span> at the end of ver. 30 (<span class="accented">aron</span> for <span class="accented">aretz</span>). Others think that some deportation of the Danites by the Syrians or other neighbouring people not recorded in history is here spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">All the time the house of God</span>, etc. This must have been written not earlier than the time of Samuel, and possibly much later. The house of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tabernacle, was in Shiloh from the days of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>) till the days of Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>), after which we have no account of where the house of God was till the ark was brought up to Jerusalem by King David from the house of Obed-edom the Gittite (<a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>), and placed in the tabernacle that David had pitched for it (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>); but whether this was the tabernacle that had been pitched at Shiloh or a new one does not appear. It is not improbable that Samuel may have moved the tabernacle from Shiloh to Ramah (<a href="/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>). The ark had rested in the house of Abinadab at Baaleh or Kirjath-jearim for twenty years (<a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>) previous to its removal by David. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/18-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Danites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#238;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
