In the context of Judges, the Danites were seeking a new territory because they had not yet secured their inheritance in the Promised Land. This group of six hundred men represents a significant military force, indicating the seriousness of their mission. Historically, the tribe of Dan struggled to conquer the land allotted to them, which led to their migration northward. This event is part of the broader narrative of the tribal confederation in Israel before the establishment of the monarchy.<p><b>stood at the entrance of the gate</b><br>The gate of a city in ancient times was not only a point of entry but also a place of commerce, legal transactions, and public gatherings. It was a strategic location for both defense and control. The presence of the Danites at the gate signifies their intent to take control and possibly intimidate the inhabitants. This action reflects the common practice of besieging or taking control of a city by first securing its gate. The gate's significance is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>, where Boaz goes to the gate to settle legal matters.<p><b>armed with their weapons of war</b><br>The mention of being armed highlights the readiness and determination of the Danites to achieve their objectives by force if necessary. In the ancient Near East, warfare was a common means of resolving disputes and acquiring territory. The Israelites were often engaged in battles to secure the land promised to them by God. The phrase underscores the militaristic aspect of the period of the Judges, a time characterized by frequent conflicts and the need for strong leadership. This readiness for battle can be contrasted with the spiritual battles described in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are called to put on the full armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/danites.htm">Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descended from Dan, one of the twelve sons of Jacob.

These 600 are determined to secure territory, echoing the later mustering of whole tribes for battle (<a href="/judges/20-2.htm">Judges 20:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-8.htm">1 Samuel 11:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records exact numbers to emphasize the historical reality of the event&#8212;real men, real swords, real consequences (<a href="/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>stood at the entrance of the gate</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;stood at the entrance of the gate&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; In ancient Israel the gate was the place of decisions and transactions (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2</a>). By stationing themselves there, the Danites seize control of Micah&#8217;s compound, asserting authority before any negotiation occurs.<p>&#8226; Their posture recalls Lot at Sodom&#8217;s gate (<a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>) and elders judging at the gate (<a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). Here, however, the gate becomes a choke point&#8212;an intimidating show of force rather than a seat of justice.<p>&#8226; The narrative highlights how easily might can replace righteousness when people do what is &#8220;right in their own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>armed with their weapons of war</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;armed with their weapons of war.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores their readiness to fight, foreshadowing the violent seizure of Micah&#8217;s idol and the later destruction of Laish (<a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often records Israel going to battle under God&#8217;s command (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2-5</a>). Here, no divine directive is mentioned; the weapons signify self-reliance and intimidation.<p>&#8226; The contrast between human armament and divine strength runs through the Bible: &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). Paul echoes the principle spiritually: &#8220;The weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-16.htm">Judges 18:16</a> paints a vivid snapshot of 600 determined Danite warriors occupying Micah&#8217;s gate with drawn weapons. The verse highlights their collective resolve, their strategic control of the gate, and their reliance on military power rather than God&#8217;s guidance. It sets the stage for the tribe&#8217;s subsequent actions, illustrating the moral drift of Israel during the period when &#8220;there was no king&#8230; and everyone did what was right in his own eyes.&#8221;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/18-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The six</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
