Judges were leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression. Their deaths often led to a relapse into sin, highlighting the Israelites' dependence on human leadership rather than on God. This phrase underscores the temporary nature of the judges' influence and the Israelites' failure to maintain faithfulness without strong leadership.<p><b>the Israelites became even more corrupt than their fathers</b><br>This indicates a progressive moral and spiritual decline. Each generation fell deeper into sin, suggesting a failure to learn from past mistakes. The phrase "more corrupt" implies an intensification of idolatry and disobedience. This pattern of worsening sin is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating the need for a savior who can bring lasting change.<p><b>going after other gods to serve them and bow down to them</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue for Israel, often influenced by the surrounding Canaanite culture. The act of serving and bowing down to other gods signifies a complete turning away from the covenant relationship with Yahweh. This behavior violated the first two commandments and demonstrated a lack of trust in God's provision and protection.<p><b>They would not give up their evil practices and stubborn ways</b><br>The Israelites' refusal to abandon their sinful behaviors reflects a hardened heart and a willful rebellion against God. "Evil practices" likely included idolatry, immorality, and injustice, which were prevalent in Canaanite religion and culture. The term "stubborn ways" suggests an obstinate refusal to repent, echoing the stiff-necked nature of the Israelites described in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in Exodus and Deuteronomy. This stubbornness highlights the need for a new heart and spirit, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, pointing to the transformative work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression and guide them back to Him.
