The selection of 10,000 men indicates a deliberate and organized approach, emphasizing the seriousness of the conflict. The term "select men" suggests these were elite warriors, chosen for their skill and bravery. The frontal assault signifies a direct and aggressive tactic, reflecting the intensity of the civil war within Israel. Gibeah, a city in the territory of Benjamin, was the focal point of this conflict due to the grievous sin committed there, as recounted in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. This event underscores the theme of justice and retribution in the narrative.<p><b>and the battle was fierce</b><br>The intensity of the battle is underscored by the word "fierce," indicating a brutal and hard-fought engagement. This reflects the deep divisions and the high stakes involved in this internal conflict among the tribes of Israel. The ferocity of the battle can be seen as a consequence of the moral and social decay depicted in the preceding chapters, where the lack of centralized leadership ("In those days Israel had no king") led to chaos and violence. The fierce nature of the battle also serves as a reminder of the destructive potential of sin and disobedience to God's covenant.<p><b>But the Benjamites did not realize that disaster was upon them</b><br>This phrase highlights the element of surprise and the impending doom for the tribe of Benjamin. The Benjamites' lack of awareness of their impending disaster can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual blindness and the consequences of sin. Their confidence, perhaps stemming from previous victories or a sense of invincibility, blinds them to the reality of their situation. This serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and the failure to heed warnings. The disaster that befalls them is a direct result of their actions and the moral corruption that had taken root in Gibeah. This moment foreshadows the eventual downfall and near destruction of the tribe, illustrating the biblical principle that sin leads to judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/1/10,000_choice_men_from_israel.htm">10,000 Choice Men from Israel</a></b><br>These were elite warriors selected from the tribes of Israel to execute judgment against the tribe of Benjamin for their grievous sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin, where the heinous crime against the Levite's concubine took place, leading to the conflict.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>A fierce confrontation between the Israelites and the Benjamites, highlighting the severity of internal conflict within the nation of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, who were defending Gibeah and were unaware of the impending disaster due to their sin and pride.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disaster.htm">Disaster</a></b><br>The impending defeat and judgment upon the Benjamites, which they did not foresee due to their overconfidence and moral blindness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, especially when unrepented, leads to severe consequences.
