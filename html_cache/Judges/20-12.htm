The sending of men suggests a formal delegation, which was a common practice in ancient times for communication and negotiation. The tribe of Benjamin was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's youngest son, Benjamin. This action reflects the tribal confederation system in Israel before the establishment of the monarchy, where tribes acted both independently and collectively. The geographical context places Benjamin in a central location in the land of Israel, which was significant for communication and travel among the tribes.<p><b>saying, &#8220;What is this wickedness that has occurred among you?</b><br>The term "wickedness" here refers to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah, a city within the tribe of Benjamin, as described in the preceding chapter. This wickedness involved the brutal assault and murder of a Levite's concubine, which was a violation of the covenantal laws and moral standards expected of the Israelites. The inquiry reflects a judicial process, seeking accountability and justice. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on communal purity and righteousness, and such an atrocity demanded a response. This phrase also echoes the prophetic tradition of calling out sin and urging repentance, seen throughout the Old Testament. The call for accountability can be seen as a type of Christ's role in calling out sin and offering redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribes_of_israel.htm">Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The collective group of the twelve tribes descended from the sons of Jacob, who are addressing the tribe of Benjamin regarding a grievous sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_benjamin.htm">Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, which is being confronted by the other tribes for harboring wickedness within its borders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_sent.htm">Men Sent</a></b><br>Representatives or messengers from the tribes of Israel tasked with delivering a message of inquiry and confrontation to the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wickedness.htm">Wickedness</a></b><br>Refers to the grievous sin committed by certain men of Gibeah, a city within the territory of Benjamin, which led to a national crisis.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin where the atrocity took place, leading to the confrontation by the other tribes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/confronting_sin_in_the_community.htm">Confronting Sin in the Community</a></b><br>The tribes of Israel demonstrate the importance of addressing sin within the community.
