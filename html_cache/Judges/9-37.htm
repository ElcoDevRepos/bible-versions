His speaking up signifies a moment of tension and impending conflict. This reflects the recurring theme in Judges of Israel's internal strife and the consequences of turning away from God. Gaal's boldness can be seen as both a challenge to Abimelech's authority and a fulfillment of the cycle of rebellion and deliverance that characterizes the book.<p><b>&#8220;Look, people are coming down from the center of the land</b><br>The "center of the land" likely refers to the strategic and elevated position of Shechem, a significant city in Israel's history. This phrase indicates a military movement, suggesting an impending attack or confrontation. The geographical reference underscores the importance of Shechem as a central hub in the tribal confederation of Israel, often associated with covenant renewal and conflict resolution, as seen in <a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24</a>.<p><b>and one company is coming by way of the Diviners&#8217; Oak.&#8221;</b><br>The "Diviners&#8217; Oak" is a notable landmark, possibly a site associated with pagan practices or local traditions of divination. This reference highlights the syncretism present in Israel during the time of the Judges, where Canaanite religious practices often infiltrated Israelite worship. The oak's mention may also serve as a reminder of the spiritual decline and the need for Israel to return to exclusive worship of Yahweh.

His speaking &#8220;again&#8221; shows persistence in sounding the alarm even after Zebul tried to dismiss his first warning (<a href="/judges/9-36.htm">Judges 9:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents the scene as eyewitness testimony, underscoring its historical accuracy. Just as Elisha&#8217;s servant&#8217;s eyes were opened to see God&#8217;s forces (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>), Gaal&#8217;s eyes see Abimelech&#8217;s approach.<p>&#8226; God is allowing Gaal&#8217;s clear sight so that the treachery and violence within Shechem will be exposed, fulfilling Jotham&#8217;s prophetic curse (<a href="/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look, people are coming down from the center of the land</b><p>&#8226; The phrase paints a literal picture: troops descend from the elevated heartland around Shechem. This fits the geography&#8212;Shechem sits in a valley between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Coming down&#8221; recalls previous biblical scenes where attacking forces descend from high ground (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>&#8210;12). The wording signals imminent danger, not imagination.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereign timing is evident. While Shechem&#8217;s leaders celebrate harvest (<a href="/judges/9-27.htm">Judges 9:27</a>), judgment &#8220;comes down&#8221; unexpectedly, echoing <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and one company is coming by way of the Diviners&#8217; Oak</b><p>&#8226; A second detachment approaches along a landmark known locally as &#8220;the Diviners&#8217; Oak,&#8221; likely a pagan cult site. The text treats the oak as a fixed, recognizable point; its mention roots the account in concrete reality.<p>&#8226; Strategically, Abimelech splits his forces (<a href="/judges/9-34.htm">Judges 9:34</a>). By highlighting that &#8220;one company&#8221; flanks the city, Scripture shows the completeness of the encirclement&#8212;like Joshua&#8217;s ambush of Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail reminds readers that pagan practices had spread through the land (<a href="/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a>). Judgment thus arrives by the very path identified with idolatry, underlining <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>: exchanging God&#8217;s truth for false worship invites ruin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-37.htm">Judges 9:37</a> records Gaal&#8217;s second, sharper warning: he sees Abimelech&#8217;s men descending from Shechem&#8217;s heights and another unit advancing past the notorious Diviners&#8217; Oak. The verse captures a moment of literal, historical drama&#8212;God orchestrating events to fulfill Jotham&#8217;s curse on a city that embraced idolatry and treachery. Gaal&#8217;s clear sight, the attackers&#8217; divided approach, and the pagan landmark together reveal how sin&#8217;s hidden roots become visible and how divine judgment approaches swiftly and unmistakably.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">By the middle of the land.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">by the navel of the land. </span>Probably the expression means some gently-swelling hill, but it perplexed the translators.

Hence, though the terebinth is nowhere else mentioned by this particular name, it is at least a probable conjecture that it may be the ancient tree under which Jacob's family had buried their idolatrous amulets (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gaal spake again</span>, etc. Of course, as the men got nearer, it was impossible to mistake them for anything but men.
