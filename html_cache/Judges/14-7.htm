Samson's journey to Timnah, a Philistine territory, represents a departure from his Nazirite vow and the covenantal expectations of Israel. The geographical movement "down" can be seen as a metaphor for his moral and spiritual decline. This journey is part of a larger narrative where Israel is under Philistine oppression, and Samson's actions are pivotal in God's plan to deliver Israel, despite his personal failings.<p><b>and spoke to the woman</b><br>Samson's interaction with the Philistine woman marks a significant moment in his life. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, marrying outside the Israelite community was discouraged, as it often led to idolatry and assimilation into pagan practices. This encounter foreshadows the conflict between Samson's personal desires and his divine calling. The act of speaking to her suggests a level of engagement and interest that goes beyond mere attraction, indicating the beginning of a relationship that will have significant consequences.<p><b>because she was pleasing to his eyes</b><br>This phrase highlights Samson's impulsive nature and tendency to be led by his senses rather than spiritual discernment. The emphasis on physical attraction underscores a recurring theme in Samson's life: his susceptibility to temptation and his failure to adhere to the spiritual discipline expected of a Nazirite. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative where the Israelites often succumb to the allure of foreign gods and cultures, leading to their downfall. Samson's focus on what is "pleasing to his eyes" contrasts with the biblical call to live by faith and obedience to God's commands, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, given by God, and his Nazirite vow.

As with Joseph&#8217;s descent into Egypt (<a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5&#8211;8</a>), even choices that look compromising will be woven into divine purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and spoke to the woman</b><p>- Samson moves from merely seeing (<a href="/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1</a>) to interacting.

Each step illustrates how God works through flawed human desires while warning His people: physical attraction must submit to covenant loyalty. Cross-referencing Samson&#8217;s journey with other biblical narratives shows that when God&#8217;s people rely on what &#8220;pleases the eyes&#8221; instead of what honors the Lord, descent&#8212;both geographic and spiritual&#8212;soon follows, yet the Lord&#8217;s redemptive plan remains sovereign throughout.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Talked with the woman.</span>--His father and mother seem to have preceded him, and made the betrothal arrangements; otherwise he would not have been allowed by Eastern custom to talk with her.
