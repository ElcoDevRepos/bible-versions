The gold&#8212;plentiful because the defeated foe was an Ishmaelite people known for such ornaments&#8212;demonstrates God&#8217;s abundant provision.

Again human weakness breaks out in this great man, and we seem to see the effect of great prosperity in stirring up selfish desires in his heart. It was perhaps not without significance that mention was made in ver. 21 of his taking the ornaments that were on the camels' necks in connection with the slaughter of the kings. Anyhow we have now a second instance of a love of spoil. It seems to have been a national custom with the Ishmaelites, among whom the Midianites are reckoned (see <a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25-28</a>), to wear golden rings; hence when they came to strip the slain there was a vast booty of gold rings. These Gideon asked for as his share, and the people readily agreed to the request. <span class="cmt_word">Ear-rings</span>. The word is singular in Hebrew, which agrees with its more proper signification of <span class="accented">nose-ring</span>, an ornament often worn by both men and women in the East. Gesenius mentions having seen at Leipsic some Indian dancing women with nose-rings. It is distinctly marked as a nose-ring in <a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22, 30, 47</a>, because in the last verse Abraham's servant says that he "<span class="accented">put</span> <span class="accented">the ring</span> (<span class="accented">han-nezem</span>) <span class="accented">upon her nose"</span> (<span class="accented">face</span>, A.V.). Again, in <a href="/ezekiel/16-12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a> the Hebrew is, "I <span class="accented">placed a ring upon thy nose"</span> (I put a jewel upon thy forehead, A.V.). So also <a href="/job/42-11.htm">Job 42:11</a>, "<span class="accented">one</span> <span class="accented">ring of gold</span>," implies that it was a nose-ring, and not an ear-ring. In other passages, however, as <a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>, it is expressly said that these rings were worn in the ears; while in others, again, there is nothing to mark whether they were worn in the ears or in the nose, as <a href="/proverbs/25-12.htm">Proverbs 25:12</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>, except that in the latter passage the singular number in the Hebrew is more favourable to the <span class="accented">nose-ring</span> than to the <span class="accented">ear-rings</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the A.V. translates it. It is thought by many, with some probability, that the nose-ring did not pierce the gristle of the nose, but hung down upon the nose from a fillet round the forehead. In every case they were of gold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(gi&#7695;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1439.htm">Strong's 1439: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gideon -- a judge of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">added,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
