Dreams were often seen as divine messages in ancient cultures, and interpretations were taken seriously. This reflects the belief in divine intervention and guidance, a common theme throughout the Bible.<p><b>This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite:</b><br>Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, was a judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites. The mention of "the sword of Gideon" symbolizes God's empowerment of Gideon to lead Israel to victory. The reference to his father, Joash, emphasizes Gideon's humble origins, highlighting God's use of unlikely individuals to fulfill His purposes.

The phrase "delivered into his hand" is a common biblical expression indicating complete victory granted by God. This reflects the recurring biblical theme of God fighting for His people (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>) and is a fulfillment of the promise God made to Gideon earlier in <a href="/judges/6-16.htm">Judges 6:16</a>.

Another soldier immediately answers, and Scripture says, &#8220;His friend replied&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-14.htm">Judges 7:14</a>).<p>- God orchestrates this midnight conversation to encourage Gideon, much like He later reassures Elijah with a gentle whisper (<a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12-18</a>).<p>- The quick, confident response shows that God can use even pagan soldiers to proclaim His purpose, echoing how Balaam&#8217;s donkey spoke truth (<a href="/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon</b><p>- The phrase signals recognition of an unstoppable force coming against Midian.<p>&#8226; Sword = agency of judgment (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Gideon = God&#8217;s chosen instrument (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14</a>).<p>- The Midianite soldier interprets the dream exactly as God intends, paralleling Pharaoh&#8217;s cupbearer and baker whose dreams foretold future realities (<a href="/bsb/genesis/40.htm">Genesis 40</a>).<p>- For Gideon, hearing an enemy confess this is divine confirmation: &#8220;If you are afraid to attack, go down and listen&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-10.htm">Judges 7:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Son of Joash, the Israelite</b><p>- Naming Gideon&#8217;s father roots the promise in family history; God is faithful to generations (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>).<p>- Calling him &#8220;the Israelite&#8221; distinguishes him from the multitude of Midian and Amalek (<a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>), underscoring that God works through His covenant people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>).<p>- Identity matters: when David faced Goliath, he proclaimed his lineage and covenant confidence (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God has delivered Midian</b><p>- The soldier declares Midian&#8217;s defeat as a settled fact&#8212;&#8220;has delivered,&#8221; not &#8220;will deliver.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Similar tense of certainty appears in <a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>: &#8220;I have delivered Jericho into your hand.&#8221;<p>- The statement highlights divine sovereignty; victory originates with God, not human strength (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p>- Gideon, whose name means &#8220;hewer,&#8221; will cut down Midian precisely because the Lord decrees it (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the whole camp into his hand</b><p>- No partial win&#8212;God promises total conquest (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-47.htm">Psalm 18:47-48</a>).<p>- &#8220;Into his hand&#8221; recalls how the Lord repeatedly &#8220;delivered&#8221; Israel&#8217;s enemies to judges like Othniel (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>).<p>- Complete deliverance foreshadows Christ&#8217;s ultimate triumph over every adversary (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-14.htm">Judges 7:14</a> is God&#8217;s encouragement package wrapped in an enemy soldier&#8217;s mouth. Each phrase unfolds assurance: the soldier&#8217;s reply is divinely timed, the &#8220;sword of Gideon&#8221; signals God&#8217;s chosen instrument, naming his lineage affirms covenant identity, the past-tense promise of Midian&#8217;s downfall reveals God&#8217;s sovereignty, and the guarantee of total victory underscores His comprehensive deliverance. Hearing this, Gideon worships (<a href="/judges/7-15.htm">Judges 7:15</a>), gathers his 300 men, and walks into a battle already decided by the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon.</span>--The sort of dread which revealed itself by this instant interpretation of the dream shows that Israel Was formidable even in its depression, doubtless because the nations around were well aware of the Divine aid by which they had so often struck terror into their enemies. The fact that this Bath Kol echoed the promise which Gideon had already received (<a href="/judges/7-9.htm" title="And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, get you down to the host; for I have delivered it into your hand.">Judges 7:9</a>) would give it additional force.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is nothing else</span>, etc. The dream and the interpretation are striking evidences of the terror which Gideon's name had already inspired among the Midianites. Because, although both the dream and the interpretation were of God, for the encouragement of Gideon in his great undertaking, yet they followed the course of nature and the laws of psychology. The presentiment that God had delivered Midian into Gideon's hand is exactly like the terror in the minds of the Canaanites which preceded the arrival of Joshua (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His friend</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
