The tribe of Dan is seeking a new territory, and they have come to Micah's house, which is significant because it contains a private shrine. This reflects the period of the Judges, characterized by a lack of centralized worship and the phrase "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>).<p><b>and took the graven image,</b><br>The graven image refers to an idol that Micah had made, violating the commandment against idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). This act of taking the image highlights the spiritual decline in Israel, where even the Levites, who were supposed to lead in worship, were complicit in idolatry.<p><b>the ephod,</b><br>The ephod was a priestly garment, but in this context, it likely refers to an object used for divination. This misuse of religious items underscores the syncretism and corruption of true worship during this time. The ephod's presence in a private home rather than the tabernacle indicates a departure from established worship practices.<p><b>the household idols,</b><br>Household idols, or teraphim, were small figurines used for worship and divination. Their presence in Micah's house suggests a blending of Canaanite religious practices with Israelite worship, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-14</a>).<p><b>and the molten idol,</b><br>The molten idol, made of metal, further emphasizes the idolatrous practices that had infiltrated Israelite society. This reflects the influence of surrounding pagan cultures and the Israelites' failure to fully obey God's commands to drive out the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27-36</a>).<p><b>the priest said to them, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</b><br>The priest, a Levite hired by Micah, questions the Danites' actions. His presence in Micah's house instead of serving at the tabernacle shows the disarray in the priestly order. His question reveals a moment of conflict, as he is torn between his loyalty to Micah and the opportunity to serve a larger group, reflecting the personal ambition and lack of spiritual integrity prevalent among the leaders of that time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>An Ephraimite who created a shrine with idols and hired a Levite to be his personal priest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Dan seeking a new territory for themselves, as they had not yet secured their inheritance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite_priest.htm">The Levite Priest</a></b><br>A young Levite who was hired by Micah to serve as a priest in his household.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah's_house.htm">Micah&#8217;s House</a></b><br>The location where Micah set up his shrine with the carved image, ephod, and household idols.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_carved_image_and_idols.htm">The Carved Image and Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship that were contrary to the commandments given to Israel, representing idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is a recurring sin in Israel's history, and it begins with small compromises.
