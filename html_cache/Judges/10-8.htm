The oppression is a direct consequence of Israel's disobedience to God, as they repeatedly turned to idolatry. The term "harassed and oppressed" suggests both psychological and physical suffering, emphasizing the severity of their plight. This pattern of oppression is a recurring theme in Judges, reflecting the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>and they did so for eighteen years</b><br>The duration of eighteen years signifies a prolonged period of suffering, underscoring the severity of Israel's situation. This extended time of oppression serves as a reminder of the consequences of persistent disobedience. The number eighteen, while not having a specific symbolic meaning in biblical numerology, emphasizes the long-term impact of Israel's actions and the patience required before deliverance. It also reflects God's allowance of suffering as a means to bring His people back to repentance.<p><b>to all the Israelites on the other side of the Jordan in Gilead</b><br>This geographical reference to "the other side of the Jordan in Gilead" indicates the specific region affected by the oppression. Gilead was a fertile area east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and strategic location. The mention of this region highlights the division of the Israelite tribes, with some settling east of the Jordan. This division sometimes led to vulnerabilities, as seen in this context. The tribes in Gilead were often more exposed to external threats due to their location.<p><b>the land of the Amorites</b><br>The Amorites were a significant Canaanite group known for their strength and influence in the region. The reference to "the land of the Amorites" connects to the historical conquest narratives where Israel was commanded to drive out the inhabitants of Canaan. The continued presence and influence of the Amorites serve as a reminder of Israel's incomplete obedience to God's commands. This incomplete conquest led to ongoing struggles and conflicts, as seen in this period of oppression. The Amorites' presence in Gilead also highlights the persistent challenges Israel faced in maintaining their covenantal identity amidst surrounding pagan cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are experiencing oppression due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ammonites.htm">The Ammonites</a></b><br>A group of people who oppressed the Israelites for eighteen years, demonstrating the consequences of Israel's turning away from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and fertile land, which was part of the territory given to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amorites.htm">The Amorites</a></b><br>The original inhabitants of the land of Gilead, whose territory was taken by the Israelites under Moses and Joshua.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eighteen_years_of_oppression.htm">Eighteen Years of Oppression</a></b><br>A significant period of suffering for the Israelites, highlighting the severity of their situation and the need for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' suffering under the Ammonites serves as a reminder of the serious consequences of turning away from God and embracing idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>The cycle of sin and oppression in Judges highlights the need for genuine repentance and turning back to God for deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_despite_unfaithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness Despite Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>Even in their suffering, God remains faithful to His covenant people, ready to deliver them when they repent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership.htm">The Role of Leadership</a></b><br>The absence of strong, godly leadership during this period underscores the importance of righteous leaders who guide people according to God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_crying_out_to_god.htm">The Power of Crying Out to God</a></b><br>The Israelites' eventual deliverance comes when they cry out to God, illustrating the power of prayer and dependence on Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_10_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 10:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_in_18_years_of_oppression.htm">How can we trust God during "eighteen years" of oppression like Israel faced?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Judges_10_8_for_trials_today.htm">What lessons from Judges 10:8 apply to enduring trials in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Judges_10_8_link_to_Israel_s_disobedience.htm">How does Judges 10:8 connect with other instances of Israel's disobedience and consequences?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_sin_like_Israel_in_Judges.htm">What steps can we take to avoid falling into sin like Israel in Judges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Church_aid_for_prolonged_suffering.htm">How can the church support those experiencing prolonged suffering, as seen in Judges 10:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_were_Israelites_oppressed_18_years.htm">Why did God allow the Israelites to be oppressed for eighteen years in Judges 10:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Judges_10_8_God_s_reaction_to_Israel.htm">What does Judges 10:8 reveal about God's response to Israel's disobedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Judges_10_8_Idolatry_s_oppression_link.htm">How does the oppression in Judges 10:8 reflect the consequences of idolatry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_judges_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Judges 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_lies_east_of_the_jordan_river.htm">What lies east of the Jordan River?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_we_trust_psalm_108_8-9's_borders.htm">How can we trust the territorial claims in verse 8&#8211;9 if there&#8217;s little archeological evidence aligning with these borders (Psalm 108:8&#8211;9)?

Physical distance from the tabernacle at Shiloh may have made them more vulnerable.<p>- This region, won from the Amorites under Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-36</a>), is now ironically suffering under a new Amorite coalition, revealing how quickly gains are lost when faith erodes (<a href="/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9-12</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;all the Israelites&#8221; emphasizes corporate responsibility; sin in any part of the nation affects the whole (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/judges/10-8.htm">Judges 10:8</a> records God&#8217;s immediate and measured discipline: in the very year of their apostasy, Israel is crushed by oppressors for eighteen years, especially the eastern tribes in Gilead. The verse illustrates the certainty of covenant consequences, the severity of life outside God&#8217;s protection, and the patient purpose of divine discipline&#8212;driving His people back to exclusive loyalty and reminding us that obedience is the only secure ground for blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>; <a href="/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">That year.</span>--The narrative is evidently imperfect, as no year is specified.<p><span class= "bld">Vexed and oppressed.</span>--This again is a <span class= "ital">paronomasia, </span>or assonance, like "broke to yoke" in English,<p><span class= "bld">The land of the Amorites.</span>--The kingdoms of Og and Sihon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That year</span>.
