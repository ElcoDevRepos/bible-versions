Earlier in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>, God instructed Gideon to reduce his army to prevent Israel from boasting that their own strength saved them. This act reflects a recurring biblical theme where God uses a faithful remnant to achieve His purposes, as seen in stories like Noah's family during the flood and the remnant of Israel in exile.<p><b>but kept the three hundred men</b><br>The selection of the 300 men is significant, as it highlights God's power in using a small, seemingly inadequate force to achieve victory. This echoes the biblical principle that God often chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to shame the strong and wise (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). The number 300 is not symbolic in itself but serves to emphasize the miraculous nature of the impending victory.<p><b>who took charge of the provisions and rams&#8217; horns of the others</b><br>The provisions and rams' horns (shofars) are practical and symbolic. The provisions indicate readiness for battle, while the rams' horns are instruments of war and worship, used to signal and rally troops. The shofar is also associated with significant biblical events, such as the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6) and the proclamation of the Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>), symbolizing God's intervention and deliverance.<p><b>And the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley</b><br>The geographical setting underscores the strategic advantage given by God. The Midianites' position in the valley makes them vulnerable to surprise attacks from the higher ground. This setting is reminiscent of other biblical battles where God grants victory against overwhelming odds, such as David's triumph over Goliath (1 Samuel 17). The valley also symbolizes a place of testing and decision, as seen in the Valley of Jehoshaphat (<a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>), where God judges the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

This is also the explanation of Rabbi Kimchi, Levi Ben Gerson, &c. Provisions would be scarce in the neighbourhood of so vast a host, and it would be the desire of all that the brave 300 should be well supplied. The reason for taking 300 rams' horns would soon appear; and, indeed, but for this verse we might well wonder how each of the 300 came to have a horn of his own. Their "pitchers" were probably those in which the provisions had been carried.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/7-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Gideon sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;il&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the rest of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to their tents</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;h&#257;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
