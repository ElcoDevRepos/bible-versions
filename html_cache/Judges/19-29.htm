The Levite's homecoming marks a transition from the public sphere of Gibeah to the private sphere of his own household, highlighting the personal nature of the subsequent actions. The home, in ancient Israelite culture, was a place of refuge and safety, which contrasts sharply with the violence that follows.<p><b>he picked up a knife</b><br>The knife is a tool often associated with sacrifice and covenant in the Old Testament. In <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>, Abraham uses a knife in the near-sacrifice of Isaac, symbolizing obedience and covenant with God. Here, the knife becomes a tool of judgment and a call to action for the tribes of Israel, rather than a symbol of divine covenant.<p><b>took hold of his concubine</b><br>The concubine, a secondary wife, reflects the complex social and familial structures of ancient Israel. Her status was lower than that of a primary wife, which may have contributed to her vulnerability and the subsequent tragedy. This act of taking hold signifies the Levite's control and authority over her, yet it also underscores the tragic objectification and dehumanization she suffers.<p><b>cut her limb by limb into twelve pieces</b><br>This gruesome act is reminiscent of sacrificial rituals, yet it is a perversion of such practices. The number twelve is significant, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. This dismemberment serves as a symbolic act, calling each tribe to witness the atrocity and to respond. It echoes the division of the covenant people and foreshadows the internal strife and division that will plague Israel.<p><b>and sent her throughout the territory of Israel</b><br>The distribution of the concubine's body parts serves as a call to national unity and action against the crime committed in Gibeah. It is a shocking summons to the tribes, demanding justice and highlighting the moral decay within Israel. This act parallels the later call to unity seen in the prophetic books, where Israel is urged to return to covenant faithfulness. The sending out of the pieces can also be seen as a type of prophetic action, akin to the symbolic acts of prophets like Ezekiel, designed to provoke a response from the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is a man from the hill country of Ephraim who takes a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
