They were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. Their frequent incursions into Israelite territory were part of their efforts to dominate the region. This phrase indicates a military movement, suggesting an aggressive intent to confront or subdue the Israelites.<p><b>camped in Judah</b><br>Judah was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, occupying a significant portion of the southern part of the land. The Philistines' decision to camp in Judah highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines. This encampment would have been a direct threat to the tribe of Judah, indicating the Philistines' strategic interest in controlling or intimidating this area.<p><b>and deployed themselves near the town of Lehi</b><br>Lehi, meaning "jawbone," is significant in the narrative of Samson. It is the location where Samson would later defeat a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. The deployment of the Philistines near Lehi sets the stage for this miraculous victory. The name "Lehi" itself becomes symbolic of God's deliverance through Samson, a type of Christ, who delivers His people from their enemies. The geographical positioning of the Philistines here suggests a tactical advantage, yet it ultimately becomes a place of their defeat.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant group of people in the Old Testament, often in conflict with Israel.

The Philistines are not merely wandering; they are advancing with purpose, just as they &#8220;went up against Israel&#8221; in <a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>, initiating a 40-year domination.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Went up&#8221; often carries the idea of moving from the coastal plain to the higher hills of Judah (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>). Their elevation of geography mirrors an elevation of threat.<p>&#8226; The Lord had allowed this enemy pressure as discipline for Israel&#8217;s compromise (<a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a>). God remains sovereign over every enemy advance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Camped in Judah</b><p>&#8226; This is occupied territory. Setting up camp inside Judah means the Philistines feel bold enough to live off Israel&#8217;s land&#8212;an everyday reminder of oppression (<a href="/judges/10-9.htm">Judges 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Camping implies a lingering presence, not a quick raid. It echoes how Midian &#8220;encamped against&#8221; Israel in <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>, choking national life until God raised Gideon.<p>&#8226; For Judah, the tribe meant to lead (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), to see their hills filled with enemy tents would have been humiliating. Yet God will turn this humiliation into a stage for deliverance through Samson.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And deployed themselves</b><p>&#8226; Deployment paints the image of ranks, strategy, and intimidation&#8212;similar to the Philistine battle line in <a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>.<p>&#8226; It is a calculated show of force designed to provoke Israel to surrender Samson. Like the Assyrians &#8220;lining up&#8221; at Lachish (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-9.htm">2 Chronicles 32:9</a>), the goal is to break morale before a sword is drawn.<p>&#8226; Samson, alone yet Spirit-empowered, will soon dismantle this organized threat, proving &#8220;the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Near the town of Lehi</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Lehi&#8221; will soon mean &#8220;jawbone&#8221; after Samson&#8217;s victory (<a href="/judges/15-17.htm">Judges 15:17</a>). The very ground they choose becomes the setting where God reverses the threat.<p>&#8226; By positioning themselves here, the Philistines unknowingly march into a divine trap, not unlike Pharaoh parking his army by the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The location reminds us God often allows the enemy to set the scene so His salvation can be unmistakable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/15-9.htm">Judges 15:9</a> records the Philistines&#8217; confident invasion&#8212;advancing, camping, and deploying inside Judah at Lehi. Every strategic move heightens Israel&#8217;s vulnerability, yet each step also sets the stage for God&#8217;s rescue through Samson. The verse assures us that no enemy positioning escapes the Lord&#8217;s oversight; even hostile encampments become arenas for His power and faithfulness to shine.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Then the Philistines went up.</span>--They "went up" in hostile array against the hill-country of Judea to take vengeance for the dreadful injury which Samson had inflicted on them.<p><span class= "bld">Spread themselves in Lehi.</span>--The use of the name before the incident from which a place is said to have received the name is found also in the case of Hormah (<a href="/numbers/14-45.htm" title="Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.">Numbers 14:45</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-3.htm" title="And the LORD listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.">Numbers 21:3</a>). It was called in full Ramath-Lehi. (See on <a href="/judges/15-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.">Judges 15:17</a>.) The character of the narrative suggests the question whether the name may not have existed previously, and the play on words may not have been <span class= "ital">adapted </span>by Samson to the incident. For the name of the place is <span class= "ital">Lechi </span>(<span class= "greekheb">?????? </span>), and "a jawbone" is <span class= "ital">Lehi </span>(<span class= "greekheb">???</span>)<span class= "ital">.

Josephus, however, says that before Samson's exploit the place "had no name." It may be again alluded to in <a href="/2_samuel/23-11.htm" title="And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.">2Samuel 23:11</a>, where the words rendered "into a troop" may mean "to Lehi," as it is understood by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. </span>vii. 12, ? 4) and some MSS. of the LXX. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went up</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from their own country in the Shephelah to the hill country of Judah.
