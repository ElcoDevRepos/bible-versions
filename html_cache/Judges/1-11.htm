The "they" refers to the tribe of Judah, who were tasked with leading the conquest of the southern territories. The act of marching against Debir signifies a strategic military action, reflecting the ongoing fulfillment of God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Debir was a significant Canaanite city, and its conquest was crucial for establishing Israelite control in the region. This action is part of the broader narrative of the Israelites' struggle to fully possess the land, as commanded by God in the book of Joshua.<p><b>(formerly known as Kiriath-sepher)</b><br>Kiriath-sepher, meaning "City of Books" or "City of Scribes," suggests that this location may have been a center of learning or record-keeping in Canaanite culture. The renaming of cities by the Israelites often signified a change in ownership and a new beginning under God's covenant. The mention of the city's former name highlights the transition from Canaanite to Israelite control, symbolizing the broader theme of transformation and redemption found throughout the Bible. This renaming can also be seen as a type of Christ, who transforms and redeems those who come to Him. The conquest of Debir is also mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-15.htm">Joshua 15:15</a>, showing the consistency of the biblical narrative and the importance of this city in the conquest of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/debir.htm">Debir (Kiriath-sepher)</a></b><br>A city in the hill country of Judah, previously known as Kiriath-sepher, which means "City of Books" or "City of the Scribe."

Israel&#8217;s earlier march around Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-7.htm">Joshua 6:7&#8211;16</a>) shows that victory is tied to following divine direction, not personal might.<p>&#8226; This forward motion is mirrored in the New Testament call to &#8220;walk by faith&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>), a daily, steady advance toward God&#8217;s promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against the inhabitants of Debir</b><p>&#8226; Debir lay in the Judean hill country southwest of Hebron (<a href="/joshua/15-49.htm">Joshua 15:49</a>).

Capturing Debir meant erasing Canaanite influence and re-establishing God&#8217;s rule.<p>&#8226; This mirrors the call for a renewed mind in Christ (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>): old labels disappear when He takes possession.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/1-11.htm">Judges 1:11</a> records more than a troop movement; it pictures a people who, fresh from victory, keep advancing under God&#8217;s direction.

Perhaps, therefore, we may consider that it was a famous centre of Canaanite culture and worship. All further attempts to explain its three names must be purely conjectural. We may compare with it the name of the Egyptian Byblos (Ewald).
