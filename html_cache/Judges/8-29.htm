The name Jerubbaal means "Let Baal contend," given to him after he destroyed the altar of Baal (<a href="/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>). This act was significant in Israel's history as it marked a turning point from idolatry back to the worship of Yahweh. Gideon, the son of Joash, was from the tribe of Manasseh, one of the lesser tribes, which highlights God's use of the humble and unlikely to achieve His purposes. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God chooses the weak to shame the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><b>returned home</b><br>After leading Israel to victory over the Midianites, Gideon returned to his home. This return signifies a transition from his role as a military leader back to a private citizen. It underscores the cyclical nature of the Judges period, where leaders would rise to deliver Israel and then return to normal life, often leading to a period of peace followed by a return to idolatry. Gideon's return home also reflects the temporary nature of his judgeship, as opposed to the eternal kingship of Christ, who reigns forever (<a href="/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>).<p><b>and settled down.</b><br>Gideon's settling down indicates a period of peace and stability for Israel, as noted in <a href="/judges/8-28.htm">Judges 8:28</a>, where the land had rest for forty years. This peace, however, was temporary and conditional upon Israel's faithfulness to God. The phrase suggests a return to normalcy and domestic life, which contrasts with the chaos and warfare that characterized much of the Judges period. It also foreshadows the eventual decline into idolatry and chaos after Gideon's death, highlighting the need for a permanent and righteous king, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerubbaal.htm">Jerubbaal (Gideon)</a></b><br>Also known as Gideon, he was a judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory against the Midianites.
