In the context of Judges, the "princes" likely refer to the tribal leaders or military commanders who played a crucial role in the battle against the Canaanite oppressors. The term "princes" can also denote nobility or those with authority, emphasizing the importance of leadership in God's deliverance. This aligns with the biblical theme of God raising leaders to guide His people, as seen with figures like Moses and Joshua. The heart's alignment with these leaders suggests a unity and shared purpose in fulfilling God's will.<p><b>with the volunteers among the people</b><br>The mention of "volunteers" highlights the willingness and courage of ordinary Israelites who stepped forward to fight. This voluntary service is significant, as it demonstrates a collective commitment to God's cause without coercion. In the historical context, Israel was a confederation of tribes, and such voluntary participation was crucial for military success. This mirrors the New Testament call for believers to serve willingly, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where Paul urges believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices. The volunteers' actions can be seen as a type of Christ's willing sacrifice for humanity.<p><b>Bless the LORD!</b><br>This exclamation is a call to worship and gratitude, acknowledging God's hand in the victory. It reflects a common biblical response to divine intervention, as seen in the Psalms and other Old Testament narratives. The phrase underscores the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and faithfulness. In the broader biblical narrative, blessing the LORD is an act of worship that aligns with the first commandment to love God wholeheartedly. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory and worship of God in Revelation, where all creation praises Him for His mighty works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel who, along with Barak, led Israel to victory over the Canaanite army.

Israel</b><p><a href="/judges/5-9.htm">Judges 5:9</a> opens with Deborah&#8217;s declaration: &#8220;My heart is with the princes of Israel.&#8221; She is publicly aligning her deepest affections with the tribal leaders who courageously stepped forward in battle (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; This unity of leader and prophet echoes Moses and Joshua standing together in <a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9&#8211;13</a> and <a href="/joshua/1-16.htm">Joshua 1:16&#8211;18</a>.<p>&#8226; Good leaders who fear God bring joy to their people (<a

5:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the princes first, Scripture affirms the importance of godly leadership that sets the tone for national faithfulness (<a

&#8220;the people who volunteered,&#8221; underscoring that victory came through willing hearts, not forced conscripts.<p>&#8226; This spirit of free-will service parallels <a

the ongoing biblical pattern of voluntary devotion.<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, the principle carries into Christian ministry: &#8220;God loves a cheerful giver&#8221; (<a
