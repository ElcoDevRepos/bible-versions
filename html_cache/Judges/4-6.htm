Kedesh, a Levitical city (<a href="/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>), reminds us that Barak grew up amid Israel&#8217;s covenant teaching, so his summons is a call back to long-known truth.

Barak&#8212;and we&#8212;are reminded that when God commands, He also equips and assures victory for those who trust and obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Barak.</span>--The name means "lightning" (Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as does Barca, the family name of Hannibal and Hasdrubal. So in Virgil, the Scipios are called "two lightnings of war." (Comp. Boanerges, <a href="/mark/3-17.htm" title="And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:">Mark 3:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Kedesh-naphtali.</span>--The name "Kedesh" means a <span class= "ital">holy </span>city. There were, therefore, many towns of the name, as Kadesh-Barnea (<a href="/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-23.htm" title="And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,">Joshua 15:23</a>), and Kedesh in Issachar (<a href="/joshua/12-22.htm" title="The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;">Joshua 12:22</a>). Jerusalem is called "the holy, the noble" (<span class= "ital">El kuds, es shereef</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>This sanctuary of Naphtali was a Levitical refuge city in Galilee (<a href="/joshua/19-35.htm" title="And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,">Joshua 19:35</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm" title="And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-32.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.">Joshua 21:32</a>). Josephus says that it was not far from Ph?nicia (Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt. xiii.</span> 5, ? 6). The site of it is probably at Kades, four miles north-west of Lake Merom. The reading of the Syriac and Arabic versions here--<span class= "ital">Rakam</span>--is inexplicable. The fact that the fame of Barak had penetrated from the northern city to the southern limits of Ephraim shows that he must have been a man of great mark. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kedesh-naphtali</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Kedesh in the tribe of Naphtali (<a href="/joshua/19-37.htm">Joshua 19:37</a>), as distinguished from Kedesh in the south of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-23.htm">Joshua 15:23</a>), and others.
