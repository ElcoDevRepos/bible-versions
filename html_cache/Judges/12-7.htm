As a judge, he was a leader raised by God to deliver Israel from the oppression of the Ammonites. His tenure of six years is relatively short compared to other judges, indicating a time of intense activity and conflict. The brevity of his rule may reflect the turbulent nature of his leadership, which included the infamous vow that led to the sacrifice of his daughter (<a href="/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30-40</a>). This period is part of the cyclical pattern in Judges where Israel falls into sin, is oppressed, cries out to God, and is delivered by a judge. Jephthah's leadership highlights the theme of God using unlikely individuals for His purposes, as Jephthah was initially an outcast due to his birth (<a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11:1-3</a>).<p><b>and when he died</b><br>The death of Jephthah marks the end of his judgeship and the conclusion of his influence over Israel. His death signifies a transition in leadership and often, in the Book of Judges, a return to Israel's cycle of disobedience. The mention of his death without further detail suggests a focus on his role as a judge rather than his personal life. In the broader biblical narrative, the death of a leader often prompts reflection on their legacy and the spiritual state of the nation. Jephthah's story serves as a reminder of the consequences of rash vows and the importance of faithfulness to God.<p><b>he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead</b><br>Gilead is a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain. It was the homeland of Jephthah, and his burial there signifies a return to his roots. The specific city is not named, which may indicate that his burial was of local rather than national significance. Gilead's mention connects Jephthah to the tribal territories of Israel, emphasizing the localized nature of leadership during the time of the judges. This phrase also reflects the cultural practice of burying individuals in their ancestral lands, highlighting the importance of family and heritage in ancient Israel. The burial in Gilead underscores the theme of belonging and identity, as Jephthah, despite his earlier rejection, is ultimately laid to rest in his homeland.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his leadership during a time of conflict with the Ammonites and his tragic vow concerning his daughter.

But the burial-place of so renowned a hero as Jephthah was not likely to be forgotten, and the reading adopted by the LXX. and Vulg., "in his city, Gilead" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Ramoth-Gilead or Mizpeh of Gilead), is furnished by a mere change of into The <span class= "ital">Sebee, </span>in which Josephus says he was buried, may be a corruption of Mizpeh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Six years</span>.
