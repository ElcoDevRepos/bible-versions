In the cultural context of ancient Israel, it was significant for a husband to heed his wife's report, indicating a partnership in spiritual matters. This reflects the biblical theme of God using both men and women to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other instances like Deborah in <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4-5</a>.<p><b>When he came to the man,</b><br>The "man" here is the angel of the Lord, a divine messenger who often appears in human form in the Old Testament. This encounter takes place in the region of Zorah, within the tribal territory of Dan, which is significant as it sets the stage for the birth of Samson, a future judge of Israel. The presence of the angel signifies a divine intervention in Israel's history, similar to other angelic appearances in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> and <a href="/joshua/5.htm">Joshua 5</a>.<p><b>he asked, &#8220;Are you the man who spoke to my wife?&#8221;</b><br>Manoah's question shows his desire for confirmation and understanding of the divine message. This reflects a common biblical theme where individuals seek assurance of God's will, as seen in Gideon's request for signs in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>. It also highlights the importance of discernment in spiritual matters, a principle echoed in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>.<p><b>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he said.</b><br>The angel's response, "I am," is a simple affirmation of his identity and mission. This phrase echoes the divine self-identification found in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where God reveals Himself to Moses as "I AM." While not equating the angel with God, it suggests the authority and divine origin of the message. This encounter foreshadows the coming of Christ, who also uses the "I am" statements in the Gospel of John to reveal His divine nature and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>Manoah is the father of Samson, a significant figure in the Book of Judges.

Obedience flows from faith in the divine message his wife has already received (compare <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-20.htm">Matthew 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents such prompt action as the expected posture of the righteous: &#8220;Blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and followed his wife</b><p>&#8226; Manoah accepts that God spoke first to his wife. Instead of feeling slighted, he honors her testimony and literally follows her lead&#8212;an image of mutual respect within marriage (see <a href="/1_samuel/1-23.htm">1 Samuel 1:23-24</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>).<p>&#8226; His willingness to walk behind her models humility and unity in seeking the Lord&#8217;s will together (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he came to the man</b><p>&#8226; The narrative stresses personal encounter.
