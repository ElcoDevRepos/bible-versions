This attack follows the death of Joshua, during a time when the Israelites were tasked with taking possession of the Promised Land. Judah's leadership in this attack is significant, as it foreshadows the eventual rise of the Davidic line, from which Jesus Christ would come. The act of attacking also reflects the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and the inhabitants of Canaan, a struggle that was both physical and spiritual.<p><b>the LORD delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine intervention and sovereignty of God in the battles of Israel. The Canaanites and Perizzites were among the various groups inhabiting the land of Canaan, and their defeat was crucial for the Israelites to establish themselves in the land. The deliverance by the LORD highlights the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land. It also serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God results in His favor and victory.<p><b>and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek</b><br>Bezek is identified as a location where this significant battle took place. The striking down of ten thousand men indicates a decisive victory, showcasing the might and effectiveness of Judah's forces under divine guidance. This victory at Bezek is a testament to the power of God working through His chosen people. The number ten thousand, often used in scripture to denote a large, complete number, underscores the totality of the victory. This event can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where He conquers the spiritual enemies of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Leah.
