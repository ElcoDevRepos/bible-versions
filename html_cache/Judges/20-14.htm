This indicates a unified response from the tribe of Benjamin, highlighting the strong tribal loyalty and identity that existed among the Israelites. The cities of Benjamin were strategically located in the central hill country of Canaan, which provided natural fortifications and a sense of security.<p><b>they came together at Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah was a significant city within the territory of Benjamin, known for its elevated position and strategic importance. It was the hometown of King Saul, Israel's first king, and had a reputation for being a stronghold. The gathering at Gibeah underscores its role as a central place for the tribe of Benjamin, both politically and militarily. Archaeological evidence suggests that Gibeah was a fortified city, which would have made it a logical rallying point for the Benjamites.<p><b>to go out and fight against the Israelites</b><br>This phrase highlights the internal conflict within the nation of Israel, as the tribe of Benjamin prepared to fight against the other tribes. The civil war was sparked by the heinous crime committed in Gibeah, as described in the preceding chapters. The Benjamites' decision to fight rather than surrender the guilty men reflects the deep-seated issues of justice, loyalty, and pride. This conflict foreshadows the later divisions within Israel, such as the split between the northern and southern kingdoms. The Benjamites' resistance can be seen as a type of the broader human rebellion against divine justice, contrasting with the ultimate reconciliation offered through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descended from Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob.

Unlike earlier periods when tribes hesitated to answer calls for help (<a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15-17</a>), here none stay behind.<p>&#8226; Their unity reveals the power of shared identity&#8212;yet it is marshalled for the wrong purpose. Compare <a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a> where people unify around rebellion, and contrast with God-honoring unity in <a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a> and <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-44</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores accountability: the decision is collective, so the coming judgment will be collective (<a href="/judges/20-46.htm">Judges 20:46-48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they came together at Gibeah</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;came together to Gibeah&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Gibeah is both the crime scene (<a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22-30</a>) and the rallying point. By choosing that specific town, Benjamin openly identifies with its sin rather than distancing itself (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Gathering at Gibeah signals defiance against the nationwide assembly at Mizpah (<a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>). Two centers form: one aligned with covenant faithfulness, the other with stubborn loyalty to kin.<p>&#8226; This physical convergence at Gibeah foreshadows later moments when Israel gathers at places of sin for battle&#8212;such as the showdown on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to go out</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;to go out&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase pictures offensive movement, not mere defense.

Civil war within God&#8217;s family illustrates the devastation when justice is refused (<a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Benjamin chooses blood ties over moral truth. This mirrors <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a> where Jesus warns that allegiance to family over righteousness misplaces loyalty.<p>&#8226; Their stance forces Israel into painful but necessary discipline (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-19.htm">Deuteronomy 19:19</a>). When sin is sheltered, confrontation becomes an act of covenant fidelity (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-14.htm">Judges 20:14</a> records Benjamin&#8217;s united, deliberate march from every city to Gibeah, determined to launch an offensive battle against the rest of Israel. Their collective decision to defend blatant sin rather than repent exposes how communal loyalty can be misused, turning brother against brother and inviting severe judgment. The verse warns that unity devoid of righteousness leads to tragic conflict, while calling God&#8217;s people to prioritize covenant truth over tribal allegiance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the children of Benjamin</span>.
