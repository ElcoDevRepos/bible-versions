In the context of <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>, it marks the continuation of a prolonged conflict between the Israelites and the tribe of Benjamin. The third day can symbolize a turning point, as seen in other biblical events such as the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which also occurred on the third day, indicating hope and redemption.<p><b>the Israelites went up against the Benjamites</b><br>This conflict arose from a grievous crime committed in Gibeah, a city of Benjamin, leading to a civil war within Israel. The Israelites, representing the other tribes, sought justice for the atrocity. This internal strife highlights the moral and social decay during the time of the Judges, a period characterized by the repeated phrase, "In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The Benjamites' resistance to handing over the guilty parties led to this confrontation.<p><b>and arrayed themselves against Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah was a significant city within the territory of Benjamin, located in the central highlands of Israel. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a fortified city, making it a strategic location for battle. The Israelites' decision to array themselves against Gibeah indicates a tactical approach to besiege the city, reflecting the military strategies of ancient Near Eastern warfare.<p><b>as they had done before</b><br>This phrase suggests a repeated action, indicating previous unsuccessful attempts by the Israelites to defeat the Benjamites. It underscores the persistence and determination of the Israelites to achieve justice, despite earlier failures. This persistence can be seen as a reflection of the broader biblical theme of perseverance in the face of adversity, as well as the need for reliance on divine guidance rather than human strength alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who are seeking justice for the atrocity committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, defending their fellow tribesmen in Gibeah, despite the grievous sin committed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin where a heinous crime occurred, leading to the conflict.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/third_day.htm">Third Day</a></b><br>Indicates the persistence and repeated efforts of the Israelites in their campaign against the Benjamites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle_positions.htm">Battle Positions</a></b><br>The strategic military arrangements made by the Israelites, showing their determination and organization.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_righteous_causes.htm">Perseverance in Righteous Causes</a></b><br>The Israelites' repeated attempts to confront the Benjamites demonstrate the importance of perseverance when seeking justice and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The conflict arose from a grievous sin in Gibeah, reminding us of the far-reaching consequences of sin and the need for accountability.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_division_among_god's_people.htm">Unity and Division Among God's People</a></b><br>The division between the tribes of Israel and Benjamin serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of disunity and the need for reconciliation within the body of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_spiritual_warfare.htm">Strategic Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites took strategic positions, believers are called to be strategic in spiritual warfare, using prayer, scripture, and community support.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership.htm">The Role of Leadership</a></b><br>The leaders of Israel had to make difficult decisions in the face of sin and injustice, highlighting the responsibility of leaders to guide their people according to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_20_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 20:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_30_Israel_s_justice_pursuit.htm">How does Judges 20:30 demonstrate Israel's persistence in seeking justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_perseverance_from_Judges_20_30.htm">What lessons on perseverance can we learn from Judges 20:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_30_Romans_12_19_link.htm">How does Judges 20:30 connect to God's justice in Romans 12:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Judges_20_30_to_spiritual_battles.htm">How can we apply Israel's strategy in Judges 20:30 to spiritual battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_faith_influence_Israel_in_Judges_20_30.htm">What role does faith play in Israel's repeated actions in Judges 20:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Israelites_battle_Benjamites_2.htm">Why did the Israelites fight the Benjamites in Judges 20:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_30_God_s_justice_shown.htm">How does Judges 20:30 reflect God's justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Judges_20_30_battle.htm">What historical evidence supports the battle in Judges 20:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_judges_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Judges 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/judges_20__is_there_archeological_proof.htm">Judges 20 (entire chapter) -
