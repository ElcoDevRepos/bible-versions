"Gathered to their fathers" is a Hebrew idiom for death, emphasizing the continuity of family and community even in death. This generation had witnessed God's miraculous acts, such as the crossing of the Jordan River and the fall of Jericho. Their passing marks a significant transition in Israel's history, as they were the last to have firsthand experience of these divine interventions.<p><b>another generation rose up</b><br>This new generation grew up in the land of Canaan, surrounded by pagan cultures and influences. Unlike their predecessors, they did not have the same direct experiences of God's power and faithfulness. This highlights the importance of passing down faith and knowledge of God to future generations, a theme echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where parents are instructed to teach their children diligently about God's commandments.<p><b>who did not know the LORD</b><br>The lack of knowledge about the LORD among this generation suggests a failure in spiritual education and discipleship. Knowing the LORD in the biblical sense involves a personal relationship and understanding of His character and deeds. This ignorance led to spiritual decline and idolatry, as seen in the subsequent chapters of Judges. It underscores the danger of neglecting to teach and model faith to the next generation.<p><b>or the works that He had done for Israel</b><br>The works refer to the miraculous events and victories God provided for Israel, such as the Exodus from Egypt, the provision in the wilderness, and the conquest of Canaan. These acts were meant to be remembered and celebrated, as seen in the establishment of feasts like Passover. The failure to remember and recount these works led to a loss of identity and purpose among the Israelites, resulting in a cycle of sin and oppression throughout the book of Judges. This serves as a warning of the consequences of spiritual amnesia and the importance of remembering God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_generation.htm">The Whole Generation</a></b><br>Refers to the generation of Israelites who entered the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership.
