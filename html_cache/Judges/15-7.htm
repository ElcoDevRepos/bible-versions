This reflects his role as a leader and deliverer of Israel, chosen by God to begin the deliverance from Philistine oppression (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). His communication with the Philistines highlights the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines, a dominant theme in the book of Judges.<p><b>Because you have done this</b><br>The Philistines had wronged Samson by giving his wife to another man, which was a personal affront and a violation of social customs of marriage and loyalty. This act of betrayal is a catalyst for Samson's actions, illustrating the cycle of personal vendetta and retaliation common in the ancient Near Eastern culture.<p><b>I will not rest</b><br>Samson's declaration of unrest signifies his determination and the seriousness of his vow. It reflects the cultural importance of honor and retribution in ancient societies. This phrase also underscores the relentless nature of Samson's character, often driven by personal motives rather than divine instruction.<p><b>until I have taken vengeance upon you</b><br>Vengeance is a recurring theme in Samson's life, often leading to violent confrontations. This reflects the lex talionis, or law of retaliation, prevalent in ancient legal systems (<a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>). Samson's actions can be seen as a type of divine justice, albeit through flawed human execution. This foreshadows the ultimate justice and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who, unlike Samson, offers forgiveness and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

This is perhaps on the whole the most probable meaning. It still leaves it uncertain whether the Philistines meant to do Samson justice, or to do him an additional injury, by putting his wife and her father to death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/15-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Samson</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8123.htm">Strong's 8123: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samson -- a deliverer of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
