The term "faithfully and honestly" implies a standard of righteousness and truthfulness that is expected in leadership decisions. In the biblical context, Abimelech's rise to power was marked by treachery and violence, as he killed his seventy brothers to secure his position (<a href="/judges/9-5.htm">Judges 9:5</a>). This contrasts with the biblical ideal of leadership, which is characterized by justice and service, as seen in the examples of Moses and David. The phrase also reflects the covenantal expectations of Israel, where leaders were to act in accordance with God's laws and commands.<p><b>if you have done well by Jerubbaal and his family</b><br>Jerubbaal, also known as Gideon, was a judge who delivered Israel from the Midianites (Judges 6-8). The mention of his family highlights the betrayal against Gideon's legacy. Gideon refused kingship, emphasizing that the Lord should rule over Israel (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>). The Shechemites' support of Abimelech, Gideon's son through a concubine, represents a departure from Gideon's values and a failure to honor his family. This phrase underscores the importance of loyalty and gratitude towards those who have served faithfully, a principle echoed in the New Testament's call to honor spiritual leaders (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>).<p><b>and if you have done to him as he deserves&#8212;</b><br>This phrase questions whether justice has been served in the treatment of Abimelech. The biblical narrative suggests that Abimelech's actions were self-serving and ruthless, contrasting with the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The concept of divine justice is central here, as God often uses human actions to fulfill His purposes, even when those actions are unjust. The eventual downfall of Abimelech (<a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53-54</a>) serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and justice, similar to the fate of other unrighteous leaders in Scripture. This phrase invites reflection on the consequences of actions and the ultimate accountability before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

The simple reference to Gideon's great actions, and the juxtaposition of the base and bloody deed in which the Shechemites and the men of the house of Millo had made themselves accomplices by choosing Abimelech for their king, formed an indictment which could not be answered. With lofty scorn and irony he wishes well to them if they had acted honourably; but if not, he predicts the inevitable Nemesis of an alliance founded in bloodshed and treachery and wrong, viz., the mutual hatred and destruction of the contracting parties. Observe how "the house of Millo" is consistently spoken of as a separate community from "the men of Shechem." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/9-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
