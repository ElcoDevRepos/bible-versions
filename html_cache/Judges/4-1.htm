His death marks the end of a period of peace and stability for Israel. Judges often served as both military leaders and spiritual guides, and their deaths frequently led to a spiritual decline among the people. Ehud's assassination of Eglon, the Moabite king, was a significant act of deliverance, and his leadership brought about 80 years of peace. His death signifies a transition and a potential vacuum in leadership, which often led to Israel's moral and spiritual decline.<p><b>the Israelites again did evil</b><br>This phrase indicates a recurring cycle in the Book of Judges: Israel falls into sin, faces oppression, cries out to God, and is delivered by a judge. The word "again" highlights the repetitive nature of Israel's disobedience. The "evil" refers to idolatry and the abandonment of the covenant with Yahweh. This cycle is a central theme in Judges, illustrating the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to God amidst surrounding pagan influences. It underscores the human tendency to fall back into sin without strong spiritual leadership.<p><b>in the sight of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the actions of the Israelites were not just morally wrong but were offensive to God, who is the ultimate judge of right and wrong. The "sight of the LORD" implies that God is always watching and aware of human actions. It also suggests that the Israelites' actions were a direct violation of their covenant relationship with God, who had given them specific commandments to follow. This phrase serves as a reminder of God's omnipresence and His concern for the moral and spiritual state of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who delivered the Israelites from Moabite oppression.
