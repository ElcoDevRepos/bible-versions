In the context of the Old Testament, God often spoke directly to leaders and prophets to guide His people. This communication underscores Gideon's role as a chosen leader, despite his initial hesitance and feelings of inadequacy (<a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>).<p><b>With the three hundred men who lapped the water</b><br>The selection of the 300 men who lapped water like a dog is significant. This method of selection was not based on military prowess but on God's criteria, which often defies human logic. The act of lapping water may symbolize vigilance and readiness, as these men did not kneel fully, keeping their eyes on their surroundings. This echoes God's preference for using the weak and humble to achieve His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>I will save you and deliver the Midianites into your hand</b><br>This promise of deliverance is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God assures His people of victory not by their strength but by His power. The deliverance from the Midianites is a fulfillment of God's covenant promises to Israel, demonstrating His faithfulness. This act of salvation prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who saves humanity from sin and death.<p><b>But all the others are to go home</b><br>The reduction of Gideon's army from 32,000 to 300 men serves to ensure that the victory could only be attributed to God, not human strength or numbers. This principle is echoed in <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit," highlighting the importance of reliance on God rather than human resources. The dismissal of the majority also reflects God's sovereignty in choosing whom He will use for His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Just as in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-10</a> the LORD calls Moses, here He personally directs Gideon, underlining that deliverance flows from His word, not Gideon&#8217;s plans.<p>&#8226; The title &#8220;LORD&#8221; (YHWH) reminds us of His covenant faithfulness first revealed in <a href="/bsb/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a> and reaffirmed in <a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>.<p>&#8226; By speaking after Gideon&#8217;s repeated requests for reassurance (<a href="/judges/6-17.htm">Judges 6:17-22, 36</a>-40), the LORD patiently confirms His guidance, illustrating <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>&#8212;He gives wisdom generously.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With the three hundred men who lapped the water</b><p>&#8226; The earlier test (<a href="/judges/7-4.htm">Judges 7:4-6</a>) reduced Israel&#8217;s forces from 32,000 to 300.

Similar vigilance is praised in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, urging believers to stay watchful.<p>&#8226; The choice of an unlikely, tiny band mirrors <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>: &#8220;for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will save you and deliver the Midianites into your hand</b><p>&#8226; The emphatic &#8220;I will&#8221; places the outcome solely on God&#8217;s power, paralleling <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>&#8212;&#8220;the battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Save&#8221; ties to <a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>, where God repeatedly raises judges to rescue Israel, pointing forward to the ultimate Savior in <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>.<p>&#8226; The promise stands despite human weakness, echoing <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>: &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But all the others are to go home</b><p>&#8226; Sending 9,700 men away prevents Israel from boasting (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>). <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that pride precedes downfall; God nips it early.<p>&#8226; The dismissed warriors still share in the nation&#8217;s deliverance, illustrating <a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>&#8212;those who stay behind receive a portion too.<p>&#8226; Their departure teaches that obedience sometimes means stepping aside, trusting God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a> showcases God&#8217;s sovereign strategy: He whittles Israel&#8217;s army to 300 vigilant men so that victory cannot be credited to human strength. The LORD Himself promises, &#8220;I will save you,&#8221; assuring Gideon that deliverance is His work alone. The verse calls believers to rely on divine power, remain watchful, and refuse pride, confident that the same faithful God still accomplishes great victories through unlikely means.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Every man unto his place.</span>--i.e., home, as in <a href="/numbers/24-11.htm" title="Therefore now flee you to your place: I thought to promote you to great honor; but, see, the LORD has kept you back from honor.">Numbers 24:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the three hundred</span>, etc. Compare the saying of Jonathan, "There is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few" (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>). The same principles which run through the choice of God s instruments on other occasions appear here. The instruments are to be such in quality or in quantity as to make it quite manifest that the excellency of the power is God's, not man's; and yet the instruments themselves are to be conspicuous for their rare excellence. The shepherd boy who sat on the throne of Israel was manifestly made to sit on that throne by the appointment of God; but what a ruler, what a noble character David was! It has always been deemed one of the proofs of the Divine origin of Christianity that its apostles were men of such humble station, and yet were able to change the whole religion and morality of the world; and yet what noble stuff Peter and John and Paul were made of! And so here the overthrow of the hosts of Midian by three hundred Israelites was manifestly the effect of the power of God fighting on their behalf. But yet what marvellous heroism was there in those three hundred! what strength of purpose, what iron-firmness of nerve, to see above thirty thousand of their comrades leave them in the face of the myriads of their foes; to remain quietly at their post, and, when the time came, to leave their camp and pour down into the plain. Their self-possession and self-restraint and absence of self-indulgence in the matter of the water was a true index of the unequalled qualities which they displayed in the sequel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the people took</span>, etc. It is almost certain that the passage ought to be rendered, "And they took the victuals of the people in their hands, and their trumpets," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the three hundred took or borrowed what provisions they needed for a few days, and the trumpets, which were to play an important part in the stratagem, from the people who were about to return to their homes. <span class="cmt_word">And the host of Midian</span>, etc. The writer repeats this to give a perfect picture of the situation. The whole army returned to their homes; the three hundred alone with Gideon in the camp; the Midianite host in the plain beneath. <p> CHAPTER 7:9-25 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/7-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
