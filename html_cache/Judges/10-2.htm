Judges were raised by God to lead and deliver Israel from oppression, often during times of moral and spiritual decline. Tola's twenty-three-year judgeship suggests a time of relative stability and peace, though the text does not provide specific details about his actions or the challenges he faced. This period of leadership is significant as it follows the tumultuous times of Abimelech, indicating a return to divinely appointed leadership. The number twenty-three, while not symbolically significant in itself, indicates a substantial period of governance, suggesting Tola's effectiveness and the trust placed in him by the people.<p><b>and when he died</b><br>The mention of Tola's death marks the end of his judgeship and the transition to the next leader. In the Book of Judges, the death of a judge often signifies a turning point, as Israel frequently fell back into sin and idolatry after the death of a leader. This cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is a recurring theme throughout the book, highlighting the need for continual reliance on God rather than human leaders. Tola's death would have been a significant event for the Israelites, as it marked the end of a period of stability and the potential for new challenges.<p><b>he was buried in Shamir</b><br>Shamir, located in the hill country of Ephraim, served as Tola's place of residence and governance. The burial of a judge in his hometown was customary, signifying honor and respect. Shamir's location in Ephraim, a central tribe of Israel, underscores the importance of Tola's leadership in uniting and stabilizing the nation. The burial site also serves as a historical marker, providing geographical context for Tola's judgeship. While there is limited archaeological evidence specifically identifying Shamir, its mention in the text situates Tola within the broader narrative of Israel's history and geography.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tola.htm">Tola</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led for twenty-three years.
