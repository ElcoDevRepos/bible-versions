Penuel, located east of the Jordan River, was a strategic site. The act of pulling down the tower symbolizes a complete defeat and humiliation of the city. This action by Gideon can be seen as a fulfillment of his earlier threat to the men of Penuel (<a href="/judges/8-9.htm">Judges 8:9</a>) when they refused to assist him and his men. The destruction of the tower signifies the removal of the city's protection and pride, reflecting the consequences of opposing God's chosen leader. In a broader biblical context, the tearing down of strongholds can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual warfare, where believers are called to demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a>).<p><b>and killed the men of the city</b><br>The execution of the men of Penuel highlights the severity of their offense against Gideon and, by extension, against God's deliverance plan for Israel. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such actions were not uncommon as a means of ensuring loyalty and eliminating future threats. This act of retribution underscores the importance of supporting God's appointed leaders and the dire consequences of failing to do so. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of divine justice and the seriousness of rebellion against God's purposes. This event also foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will come upon those who oppose God's kingdom, as seen in the eschatological prophecies throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Gideon&#8217;s action here is the follow-through of a promise he made earlier: &#8220;So he said to the men of Penuel, &#8216;When I return safely, I will tear down this tower&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/judges/8-9.htm">Judges 8:9</a>).<p>&#8211; The phrase &#8220;He also&#8221; links this judgment on Penuel to what Gideon had just done in Succoth (<a href="/judges/8-15.htm">Judges 8:15-16</a>), underscoring that both towns were treated alike for the same offense&#8212;refusing to aid Israel&#8217;s exhausted army (compare <a href="/matthew/25-42.htm">Matthew 25:42-45</a> for the seriousness of withholding help).<p>&#8211; Gideon&#8217;s decisive act parallels earlier leaders who removed obstacles to Israel&#8217;s mission, such as Moses breaking the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>) and Joshua burning Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-28.htm">Joshua 8:28</a>).<p>&#8211; Key takeaway: God&#8217;s appointed deliverer did not overlook unbelief that hindered God&#8217;s people; he acted, just as future judgment will be sure and complete (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The tower of Penuel</b><p>&#8211; In ancient cities the tower functioned as both watchtower and refuge (<a href="/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Nehemiah 3:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/61-3.htm">Psalm 61:3</a>).<p>&#8211; By tearing it down, Gideon removed the town&#8217;s symbol of security and self-reliance, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>: &#8220;The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe&#8221;. Penuel had trusted masonry over the LORD.<p>&#8211; The city had historical significance; Jacob once wrestled with God nearby and named the place Peniel, &#8220;face of God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). Their rejection of God&#8217;s deliverer was therefore doubly grievous, contrasting their heritage with present unbelief (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And killed the men</b><p>&#8211; The text records a capital judgment, not random violence. Their refusal to support Israel&#8217;s divinely led army in time of war amounted to treason (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-8.htm">Deuteronomy 20:8-9</a> for wartime responsibilities).<p>&#8211; Similar judgments fell on those who rejected God&#8217;s appointed leaders: Korah&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-35</a>) and the men of Beth-shemesh who looked into the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>).<p>&#8211; This severe outcome foreshadows the New Testament warning that rejecting the ultimate Deliverer brings eternal loss (<a href="/hebrews/10-28.htm">Hebrews 10:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of the city</b><p>&#8211; Corporate accountability is in view; the men represented their community&#8217;s stance, reminiscent of Jericho where the city as a whole was placed under the ban (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-21</a>).<p>&#8211; Their fate stands as a caution: spiritual neutrality or opposition during God&#8217;s redemptive work invites judgment (<a href="/revelation/3-16.htm">Revelation 3:16</a>).<p>&#8211; The city&#8217;s downfall highlights the truth of <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/8-17.htm">Judges 8:17</a> records Gideon keeping his word to punish Penuel for refusing aid. By tearing down their tower and executing the leaders, he stripped away false security and executed just judgment, demonstrating that opposition to God&#8217;s deliverance carries grave consequences.
