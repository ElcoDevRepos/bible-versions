The use of a fleece of wool is significant, as wool was a common material in ancient Israel, symbolizing purity and sacrifice. The threshing floor, a place where grain was separated from chaff, represents a site of judgment and decision, often used in biblical narratives to signify divine intervention (e.g., <a href="/ruth/3-6.htm">Ruth 3:6-9</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18-25</a>). Gideon's act of placing the fleece here indicates a desire for a clear sign from God in a place associated with divine activity.<p><b>If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry,</b><br>Dew in the Bible often symbolizes divine blessing and favor (<a href="/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>, <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>). Gideon's request for dew to appear only on the fleece while the surrounding ground remains dry is a test of God's power over nature, reminiscent of Elijah's challenge to the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-20.htm">1 Kings 18:20-40</a>). This specific request highlights Gideon's need for a miraculous sign to confirm God's promise, reflecting human doubt and the need for reassurance in the face of overwhelming tasks.<p><b>then I will know that You are going to save Israel by my hand,</b><br>Gideon's statement underscores the theme of divine deliverance throughout the Book of Judges. The phrase "by my hand" indicates Gideon's role as an instrument of God's salvation, a common motif where God uses unlikely individuals to achieve His purposes (e.g., Moses in Exodus, David in 1 Samuel). This reflects the biblical principle that God empowers the humble and the weak to accomplish His will (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p><b>as You have said.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of God's word and promises. Gideon's reference to what God has said points to the reliability and faithfulness of God's declarations. It echoes the biblical theme that God's word is trustworthy and will accomplish what it intends (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). This assurance is foundational for faith, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures who acted on God's promises, such as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

placing wool there invites a clear, observable result.<p>- Wool, the product of a sacrificial animal (cf. <a href="/leviticus/3-6.htm">Leviticus 3:6</a>), silently hints at dependence on God&#8217;s provision rather than human strength.<p>- Gideon acts, not by demanding God prove Himself in the heavens, but by using ordinary items at hand&#8212;much like Elijah&#8217;s altar soaked with water in <a href="/1_kings/18-33.htm">1 Kings 18:33&#8211;35</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If there is dew only on the fleece</b><p>- Morning dew was considered a daily gift from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>;

By isolating dew on the fleece and keeping the ground dry, Gideon seeks unmistakable proof that victory will come through God&#8217;s power, not human might. The episode highlights God&#8217;s patient willingness to meet His servant&#8217;s need for reassurance, encouraging believers today to trust His Word while resting in His gracious confirmations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">A fleece of wool.</span>--In works of art this is sometimes represented as an entire sheepskin, probably from an erroneous explanation of the Vulgate, <span class= "ital">Vellus lanae, </span>and from Luther's rendering, <span class= "ital">ein Fell mit der Wolle. </span>But the English version is correct.<p><span class= "bld">In the floor.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>on the open threshing-floor.

Bishop Hervey quotes Lord Bacon, who says (<span class= "ital">Nat Hist.</span>) that "Sailors have used every night to hang fleeces of wool on the sides of their ships towards the water, and they have crushed fresh water out of them in the morning." Every one must have noticed flocks of wool on the hedges, sparkling with dewdrops long after the dew on the leaves around them has evaporated. In <a href="/psalms/72-6.htm" title="He shall come down like rain on the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.">Psalm 72:6</a> (Prayer Book), "He shall come down like the rain <span class= "ital">into a fleece of wool," </span>the Hebrew word is the same as here, and the ancient version takes it in the same sense (LXX., <span class= "ital">epi plokon; </span>Vulg., <span class= "ital">in vellus</span>)<span class= "ital">; </span>but perhaps the true sense is there "mown grass," as in <a href="/amos/7-1.htm" title="Thus has the Lord GOD showed to me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, see, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.">Amos 7:1</a> (<span class= "ital">mowings</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37-40.</span> - It is difficult to guess what led to this somewhat quaint sign which Gideon asked. Possibly the dews were usually heavy upon the hill of Gilead (<a href="/judges/7-3.htm">Judges 7:3</a>, note) where Gideon was encamped, as they seem to have been on Mount Gilboa (<a href="/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>) and on Hermon (<a href="/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>), and sheep-skins may have been a common protection against the cold nights, as in Afghanistan; and he may have noticed how often in the morning both the skin that covered him, and the ground around, was wet with the heavy dew. And this may have suggested the double test, by which his faith was, through God's condescending mercy, confirmed and established. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/6-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will place</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1490;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#238;&#7713;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3322.htm">Strong's 3322: </a> </span><span class="str2">To place permanently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a fleece</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(giz&#183;za&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">A fleece</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of wool</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;e&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
