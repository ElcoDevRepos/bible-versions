The phrase "as one man" suggests a collective resolve and purpose, reminiscent of the unity seen in <a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a> when the Israelites agreed to the covenant at Sinai. This unity is significant given the context of the moral and social chaos described in the book of Judges, particularly in the chapters leading up to this event. The gathering of the tribes can be seen as a response to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah, which demanded a unified action to uphold justice and righteousness according to the law of Moses.<p><b>united against the city</b><br>The city in question is Gibeah, located in the territory of Benjamin. This phrase indicates the focus of the Israelite assembly's anger and their intent to address the atrocity committed there. Gibeah's crime, the brutal assault and murder of a Levite's concubine, is detailed in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a> and is reminiscent of the sin of Sodom in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, highlighting the moral decay within Israel. The unity against Gibeah underscores the seriousness of the offense and the necessity of purging such evil from among the people, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a>. This confrontation also foreshadows the internal strife and civil war that would ensue, illustrating the consequences of Israel's failure to fully adhere to God's commandments and the need for a righteous king, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who brings true justice and peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective tribes of Israel, excluding the tribe of Benjamin, who gathered together in unity to address the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin where a horrific crime was committed against a Levite's concubine, leading to the conflict described in <a href="/bsb/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_benjamin.htm">Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, which defended the inhabitants of Gibeah, leading to a civil war with the other tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite.htm">Levite</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Levi, whose concubine was abused and killed in Gibeah, sparking the outrage and subsequent gathering of the tribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/civil_war.htm">Civil War</a></b><br>The event that ensued as a result of the tribes of Israel uniting against the tribe of Benjamin due to the atrocity committed in Gibeah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_righteous_indignation.htm">Unity in Righteous Indignation</a></b><br>The Israelites' unity against the sin in Gibeah demonstrates the importance of collective action in addressing moral and spiritual corruption.
