This division is significant in the context of the civil war that ensues due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah, a Benjamite city. The exclusion of Benjamin underscores the severity of the conflict and the moral outrage felt by the other tribes. Historically, the tribes of Israel were meant to be united under the covenant with God, but internal strife often led to divisions, as seen here. This division foreshadows later splits in the kingdom, such as the division between Israel and Judah.<p><b>mobilized 400,000 swordsmen</b><br>The mobilization of such a large number of warriors indicates the seriousness with which the Israelites approached the conflict. This number suggests a significant military capability and reflects the tribal confederation's ability to gather a large force when necessary. The use of swordsmen points to the common weaponry of the time, with swords being a primary tool for warfare. This mobilization can be compared to other instances in the Old Testament where Israel gathers for battle, such as in the wars against the Canaanites and Philistines.<p><b>each one an experienced warrior</b><br>The emphasis on the warriors being experienced suggests that these were not merely conscripted men but seasoned fighters, likely with previous battle experience. This detail highlights the gravity of the situation and the Israelites' determination to address the sin in Gibeah decisively. The concept of experienced warriors is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as David's mighty men, who were known for their valor and skill in battle. This phrase also underscores the theme of God using human agency and military might to achieve divine purposes, as seen throughout the history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective tribes of Israel, excluding the tribe of Benjamin.
