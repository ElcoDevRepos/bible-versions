This figure appears at critical moments in Israel's history, such as with Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). The words spoken by the angel in <a href="/judges/2.htm">Judges 2:1-3</a> are a reminder of God's covenant and a rebuke for Israel's disobedience. This highlights the seriousness of Israel's failure to fully drive out the Canaanites, as commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>.<p><b>to all the Israelites</b><br>The message is directed to the entire nation, emphasizing collective responsibility. Israel's identity as a covenant community means that the actions of individuals affect the whole. This communal aspect is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the sin of Achan (Joshua 7) and the blessings and curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The Israelites' failure to obey God fully has national consequences.<p><b>the people lifted up their voices</b><br>This phrase indicates a public and communal response. Lifting up voices in the Bible often signifies a cry for help or an expression of deep emotion, as seen in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a> when the Israelites groaned under Egyptian bondage. It reflects a recognition of wrongdoing and a plea for divine intervention.<p><b>and wept</b><br>Weeping signifies genuine sorrow and repentance. In biblical culture, weeping is a common expression of grief and penitence, as seen in the lamentations of Jeremiah and the psalms of David. This response suggests that the Israelites understood the gravity of their situation and the consequences of their disobedience. However, the subsequent narrative in Judges shows that this repentance was not lasting, as the cycle of sin, oppression, and deliverance continues throughout the book.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who often appears in the Old Testament, representing God's presence and authority.

His appearance in <a href="/bsb/judges/2.htm">Judges 2</a> links back to Joshua&#8217;s closing exhortations and underscores that God Himself confronts Israel about their covenant breach. This divine, personal visitation heightens the seriousness of what follows and reminds us that obedience is never merely a human contract but a relationship overseen by the living God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had spoken these words</b><p>The words just delivered (<a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-3</a>) rehearse three truths:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;&#8220;I will never break My covenant with you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s responsibility&#8212;&#8220;You shall not make a covenant with the people of this land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Consequence of disobedience&#8212;&#8220;They will become thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.&#8221;<p>These themes echo earlier warnings (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2-4</a>; <a href="/joshua/23-6.htm">Joshua 23:6-13</a>). The Lord&#8217;s speech is both reminder and indictment: He kept His promise; they did not keep theirs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to all the Israelites</b><p>The audience is national, not merely tribal. Covenant infidelity is communal (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>). Everyone hears, therefore everyone is accountable. The text underscores that spiritual compromise is never private; it touches families, tribes, and future generations (<a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people lifted up their voices</b><p>A unified, audible response follows divine confrontation. Scripture often connects &#8220;lifting up the voice&#8221; with earnest lament or repentance (<a href="/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-1.htm">Ezra 10:1</a>; <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>). Their cry signals:<p>&#8226; Recognition of guilt<p>&#8226; Alarm at coming discipline<p>&#8226; Desire for restored fellowship<p>It is the proper first response when God&#8217;s Word exposes sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wept</b><p>Tears flow from hearts pierced by truth (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). Yet the book of Judges shows that emotion alone is not enough; lasting change demands ongoing obedience. Subsequent cycles of rebellion reveal that their weeping, though sincere, was short-lived (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). Genuine repentance requires turning from disobedience, not merely sorrowing over its consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/2-4.htm">Judges 2:4</a> captures the pivotal moment when God&#8217;s covenant people hear a divine rebuke and break down in unified grief. The angel of the LORD, speaking with God&#8217;s full authority, reminds them of His faithfulness and their failure. Their loud cries and tears show that His Word pierced their hearts, yet the surrounding narrative warns that feelings must mature into faithful action. The verse calls every generation to listen when God speaks, to grieve over sin, and&#8212;above all&#8212;to walk in lasting obedience to the covenant-keeping Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the Angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1444;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had spoken</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
