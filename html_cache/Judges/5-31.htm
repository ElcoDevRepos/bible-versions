It echoes the sentiment found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68:1-2</a>, where the enemies of God are scattered. The context of <a href="/judges/5.htm">Judges 5</a> is the Song of Deborah, celebrating Israel's victory over the Canaanite king Jabin and his commander Sisera. This victory is attributed to God's intervention, emphasizing His role as a divine warrior. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where Satan and his forces are finally vanquished.<p><b>But may those who love You shine like the sun at its brightest.</b><br>This imagery of shining like the sun is a metaphor for righteousness and divine favor. It is reminiscent of <a href="/matthew/13-43.htm">Matthew 13:43</a>, where the righteous are said to shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The phrase suggests a stark contrast between the fate of God's enemies and those who are faithful to Him. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, light often symbolizes life, blessing, and God's presence, as seen in <a href="/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>, where the Lord's face shining upon someone is a sign of blessing. This phrase also points to the transformative power of God's love and the glorification of believers, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament.<p><b>And the land had rest for forty years.</b><br>The forty-year period of rest signifies a generation's worth of peace and stability, a common motif in the Book of Judges. This rest is a direct result of God's deliverance and the people's obedience, as seen in the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, deliverance, and peace throughout Judges. The number forty is significant in biblical numerology, often representing a period of testing or completeness, as seen in the forty years of Israel's wilderness wanderings (<a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). This rest is a temporary foretaste of the ultimate rest promised to God's people, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers are invited to enter God's eternal rest through faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel who, along with Barak, led Israel to victory over the Canaanite army led by Sisera.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/barak.htm">Barak</a></b><br>The military leader who, under Deborah's guidance, led the Israelites to victory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>The commander of the Canaanite army defeated by Deborah and Barak.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jael.htm">Jael</a></b><br>The woman who killed Sisera, fulfilling the prophecy that a woman would defeat him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation experiencing a period of peace following the victory over the Canaanites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice is sure and His enemies will ultimately perish.

The total frustration of the hopes of the princesses is all the more forcibly implied by the scorn with which it is left unexpressed. The one word "so" sums up the story in all its striking phases; and this passionate exclamation accounts, in part, for the intensity of feeling which runs through the whole poem, by showing that Deborah regards the battle as part of one great religious crusade. The completeness of the overthrow caused it to be long remembered as an example of Israel's triumph over God's enemies (<a href="/context/psalms/83-9.htm" title="Do to them as to the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:">Psalm 83:9-10</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/83-12.htm" title="Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.">Psalm 83:12-15</a>). When the Christian warriors of the first crusade were riding deep in the blood of the murdered Saracens, after the capture of Jerusalem, they were fully convinced that they were "doing God service;" and so filled were they with religious emotion, that at vesper-time they all suddenly fell upon their knees with streaming tears. The general dissemination of a feeling of pity--pity even for our worst enemies--is a very modern feeling, and still far from universal.<p><span class= "bld">But let them that love him.</span>--This is probably the right reading, though it was early altered into "they that love thee."<p><span class= "bld">As the sun when he goeth forth in his might.</span>--For the metaphor, comp. <a href="/context/psalms/19-4.htm" title="Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
