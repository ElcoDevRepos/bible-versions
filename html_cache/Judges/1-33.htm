The failure to drive out the inhabitants reflects a recurring theme in the Book of Judges, where the Israelites did not fully obey God's command to remove the Canaanites from the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were cities within the territory allotted to Naphtali. Archaeological evidence suggests these were significant Canaanite settlements, indicating the challenge the Israelites faced. This failure to fully conquer the land led to the Israelites being influenced by Canaanite culture and religion, which often resulted in idolatry and disobedience to God.<p><b>So the Naphtalites also lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land,</b><br>Living among the Canaanites meant that the Israelites were in constant contact with pagan practices and beliefs, which often led to syncretism and the dilution of their worship of Yahweh. This coexistence was contrary to God's command to be separate and holy (<a href="/leviticus/20-24.htm">Leviticus 20:24-26</a>). The presence of Canaanites among them was a test of Israel's faithfulness and often resulted in spiritual compromise, as seen throughout the Book of Judges.<p><b>but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath served them as forced laborers.</b><br>The use of Canaanites as forced laborers was a pragmatic solution for the Israelites, providing economic benefits and labor for building projects. However, this arrangement was a deviation from God's command to completely drive out the inhabitants (<a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31-33</a>). This compromise reflects a lack of faith and obedience, as the Israelites relied on their own understanding rather than trusting in God's provision and protection. The situation foreshadows future issues Israel would face due to incomplete obedience, leading to cycles of sin and oppression throughout the period of the Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naphtali.htm">Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the son of Jacob and Bilhah.

By recording Naphtali&#8217;s shortfall, Scripture shows a literal, historical moment of partial obedience. The pattern had already appeared with Judah, Manasseh, Ephraim, and others in <a href="/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19, 27</a>-30. Every tribe&#8217;s compromise chipped away at Israel&#8217;s covenant calling:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promise of victory was clear (<a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3-5</a>), but fear, complacency, and misplaced confidence nudged Naphtali into settling for less.<p>&#8226; Partial obedience still counts as disobedience; the Angel of the LORD later rebukes the nation, &#8220;I will not drive them out before you; they will become thorns in your sides&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The historical note is not an error or exaggeration; it is a faithful record reminding readers that God&#8217;s people can choose convenience over command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Living among the Canaanites</b><p>&#8220;So the Naphtalites also lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land&#8230;.&#8221; Instead of Canaanites living under Israel&#8217;s banner, Israel now lives among them&#8212;a reversal of God&#8217;s intent (<a href="/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12-13</a>). This compromise bred mingling and eventual idolatry (<a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10-13</a>).<p>Consequences of coexistence:<p>&#8226; Cultural blending: forbidden alliances and marriages inevitably followed (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual erosion: pagan altars, images, and practices became accessible, normal, and enticing.<p>&#8226; Loss of witness: Israel&#8217;s distinctness dimmed, undermining its call to show the nations the holiness of Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).<p>The inspired writer underscores that living &#8220;among&#8221; rather than ruling &#8220;over&#8221; shaped the dark cycles that dominate the rest of Judges.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Forced laborers serve Israel</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath served them as forced laborers.&#8221; On the surface, Naphtali still seems victorious: they subject the Canaanites and profit from their labor. Yet God never offered economic benefit as a substitute for obedience.<p>&#8226; Zebulun used the same tactic (<a href="/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>); Solomon later conscripted remaining Canaanites (<a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-21</a>). These stop-gap measures brought short-term gain but long-term risk.<p>&#8226; The very people Israel spared would later regroup; Hazor&#8212;near Naphtali&#8212;became the center of Canaanite oppression in <a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2-3</a>.<p>&#8226; Choosing exploitation over elimination fostered an attitude of compromise that undercut faithfulness and set the stage for repeated subjugation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/1-33.htm">Judges 1:33</a> records a real, literal failure by the tribe of Naphtali. God had commanded total removal; instead, Naphtali allowed the Canaanites to remain, lived among them, and pressed them into forced labor. What looked like practical prudence was covenant unfaithfulness, opening the door to cultural assimilation and future oppression. The verse teaches that partial obedience cannot replace complete fidelity to God&#8217;s clear commands, and that compromise, even when profitable, ultimately weakens God&#8217;s people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Neither did Naphtali.--</span>See <a href="/context/joshua/19-32.htm" title="The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.">Joshua 19:32-38</a>.
