His presence here indicates a continuity of the priestly line and the importance of maintaining religious order during tumultuous times. Phinehas is known for his zealousness for God's holiness (<a href="/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7-13</a>), which underscores the gravity of the situation in <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>. His role as a priest serving before the Ark of the Covenant highlights the centrality of seeking divine guidance in Israel's military and moral crises.<p><b>The Israelites asked,</b><br>The Israelites' inquiry reflects a pattern of seeking divine counsel before making significant decisions, a practice rooted in their covenant relationship with God. This approach is consistent with other instances in the Old Testament where leaders sought God's will through the Urim and Thummim or through prophets (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Should we again go out to battle against our brothers the Benjamites, or should we stop?&#8221;</b><br>The phrasing "our brothers the Benjamites" emphasizes the internal conflict and the tragic nature of civil war within the tribes of Israel. This conflict arose from the grievous sin committed in Gibeah, a Benjamite city, and the subsequent refusal of the tribe of Benjamin to surrender the guilty parties (Judges 19-20). The question reflects the Israelites' hesitation and the moral complexity of fighting against their own kin, highlighting the tension between justice and unity.<p><b>The LORD answered,</b><br>The direct response from the LORD signifies His active involvement and sovereignty in the affairs of Israel. It reassures the Israelites of divine support and guidance, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. God's responses to Israel's inquiries often come through the priestly mediation, emphasizing the importance of the priesthood in maintaining the covenant relationship.<p><b>&#8220;Fight, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.&#8221;</b><br>This assurance of victory is a divine promise that echoes God's faithfulness to His people when they act in accordance with His will. The phrase "I will deliver them into your hand" is reminiscent of God's promises to deliver Israel's enemies into their hands during the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2, 8</a>:1). It underscores God's role as the ultimate warrior and deliverer, foreshadowing the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ. The promise of victory also serves as a test of faith and obedience for the Israelites, challenging them to trust in God's timing and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas.htm">Phinehas</a></b><br>The grandson of Aaron, serving as a priest during this time.

With Phinehas ministering at the ark, the nation seeks whether to fight again or cease. God responds unmistakably: &#8220;Fight, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.&#8221; The verse teaches that genuine spiritual leadership, persistent dependence on the LORD, recognition of both justice and brotherhood, and faith in God&#8217;s timed promises lead to victorious obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Phinehas.</span>--The fact that the high priest is. still the grandson of Aaron, who had shown such noble zeal in the desert (<a href="/numbers/25-8.htm" title="And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly.

It is remarkable that the chief personages in these two wild scenes are the grandson of Moses and the grandson of Aaron, and it is a strange illustration of the disorder of the times that while the latter fulfils the supreme functions of the high priest, the former, who has sunk to the condition of a poor wandering Levite, does not go to his powerful cousin, but serves an unknown and schismatic image for a most paltry pittance.<p><span class= "bld">Tomorrow.</span>--Comp. <a href="/judges/4-14.htm" title="And Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand: is not the LORD gone out before you?
