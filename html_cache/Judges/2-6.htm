His role was not only as a military leader but also as a spiritual guide. The dismissal of the people signifies the end of a significant era of conquest and the beginning of settlement. This moment marks a transition from a unified military campaign to individual tribal responsibilities. Joshua's leadership is a type of Christ, as he leads his people into the promised inheritance, similar to how Christ leads believers into spiritual rest and inheritance.<p><b>the Israelites went out to take possession of the land</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land of Canaan. The act of taking possession is both a physical and spiritual endeavor, as it involves obedience to God's commands and reliance on His provision. The land is a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's covenant faithfulness. The Israelites' possession of the land is a precursor to the ultimate rest and inheritance promised to believers in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>.<p><b>each to his own inheritance</b><br>The concept of inheritance is deeply rooted in the covenantal promises of God. Each tribe and family received a specific portion of land, as detailed in the book of Joshua. This distribution was not arbitrary but divinely ordained, reflecting God's sovereignty and care for His people. The inheritance also serves as a type of the eternal inheritance believers receive through Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>. The individual inheritance underscores the personal relationship each Israelite had with God, paralleling the personal relationship believers have with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.
