This failure is part of a recurring theme in the Book of Judges, where the Israelites do not completely obey God's command to remove the Canaanites from the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This disobedience led to significant spiritual and cultural consequences, as the Canaanites' presence often resulted in Israel adopting pagan practices and idolatry (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>).<p><b>living in Gezer;</b><br>Gezer was a significant Canaanite city located in the Shephelah, a region of low hills in ancient Israel. Archaeological excavations have uncovered evidence of its fortifications and Canaanite culture. Gezer's strategic location on the route between Egypt and Mesopotamia made it a valuable and contested site. The city's continued Canaanite presence highlights the incomplete conquest of the land, which was supposed to be a place of rest and blessing for the Israelites (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>).<p><b>so the Canaanites continued to dwell among them in Gezer.</b><br>The coexistence of the Canaanites with the Israelites in Gezer symbolizes the broader issue of Israel's incomplete obedience and the resulting consequences. This situation led to the Israelites being influenced by Canaanite religious practices, which often included idolatry and immorality (<a href="/judges/3-5.htm">Judges 3:5-6</a>). The presence of the Canaanites among the Israelites serves as a warning about the dangers of compromising with sin and the importance of complete obedience to God's commands. This theme is echoed throughout Scripture, emphasizing the need for holiness and separation from ungodly influences (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Ephraim.
