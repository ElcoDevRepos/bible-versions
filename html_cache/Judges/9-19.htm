Jerubbaal was a judge and a deliverer of Israel, known for his faithfulness to God (Judges 6-8). The reference to acting "faithfully and honestly" highlights the biblical principle of covenant loyalty, which was expected in relationships, especially with leaders appointed by God. The historical context here is significant: after Gideon's death, the people quickly turned away from God and failed to honor Gideon's family, which was a breach of covenant loyalty (<a href="/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33-35</a>). This phrase challenges the Shechemites to reflect on their actions and whether they have upheld the values of truth and faithfulness, which are central to God's law (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>).<p><b>then may you rejoice in Abimelech, and he in you</b><br>Abimelech, the son of Gideon and a concubine from Shechem, sought to establish himself as king by eliminating his brothers (<a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9:1-6</a>). This phrase suggests a conditional blessing, implying that if the people have acted with integrity, they can find joy in their leader, Abimelech. However, the historical and cultural context reveals a deeper irony: Abimelech's rise to power was marked by treachery and bloodshed, contrary to the righteous leadership expected in Israel. The mutual rejoicing mentioned here is contingent upon the righteousness of their actions, which is a recurring biblical theme (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>). Theologically, this reflects the biblical principle that true joy and peace in leadership come from justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>). The tragic outcome of Abimelech's reign, filled with conflict and destruction (<a href="/judges/9-22.htm">Judges 9:22-57</a>), serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unrighteous leadership and the failure to act faithfully.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerubbaal.htm">Jerubbaal (Gideon)</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory against the Midianites.

The &#8220;if&#8221; sets up a self-test for the leaders of Shechem: examine your motives and deeds in elevating Abimelech. This conditional framing reminds us that God always ties blessing to obedience and truth (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Faithfully and honestly</b><p>Being &#8220;faithful&#8221; speaks of covenant loyalty, while &#8220;honestly&#8221; points to transparent integrity (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>). The people had just funded Abimelech&#8217;s coup with temple silver taken from Baal-berith (<a href="/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4</a>), hardly an act of covenant faithfulness. Jotham presses them: were your hearts pure, or were you driven by self-interest?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Toward Jerubbaal and his house</b><p>Jerubbaal&#8212;better known as Gideon&#8212;had rescued Israel from Midian (<a href="/bsb/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>). Gratitude and loyalty were due to his family (<a href="/judges/8-35.htm">Judges 8:35</a>). Instead, the townsmen sided with Gideon&#8217;s illegitimate son and murdered the seventy rightful heirs. Cross references like <a href="/1_samuel/25-31.htm">1 Samuel 25:31</a> show how righteousness demands kindness to a benefactor&#8217;s house; Shechem failed that test.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This day</b><p>Accountability is not abstract or deferred. &#8220;This day&#8221; mirrors <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>&#8217;s urgent call to choose whom to serve.

If their motives were pure&#8212;though Jotham knows they were not&#8212;then, fine, celebrate your new king. Genuine rejoicing in leadership happens only when the appointment is righteous (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he in you</b><p>Mutual joy between ruler and people is God&#8217;s ideal (<a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>; <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3</a>). If Abimelech were God&#8217;s man, he would delight in serving Shechem sacrificially. Instead, the coming verses show hostility, not harmony (<a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23-57</a>), proving the condition unmet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19</a> is a conditional blessing that exposes Shechem&#8217;s guilt. Jotham invites the townsmen to test their actions against covenant faithfulness toward Gideon&#8217;s family. Because they had acted treacherously, their &#8220;rejoicing&#8221; in Abimelech would turn to ruin, fulfilling the principle that those who sow injustice reap calamity (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">If ye then have dealt truly.</span>--If your conduct be just and right, I wish you all joy in it.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/9-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
