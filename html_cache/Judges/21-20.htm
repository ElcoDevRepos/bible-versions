The war was sparked by a grievous crime committed in Gibeah, a Benjamite city, leading to the near annihilation of the tribe of Benjamin. The Israelites had sworn not to give their daughters to the Benjamites as wives, which created a crisis for the survival of the tribe. The elders of Israel devised a plan to provide wives for the remaining Benjamite men. This command reflects the urgency and desperation to preserve the tribe, highlighting the importance of tribal continuity in ancient Israelite society. The command also underscores the authority of the tribal leaders in directing the actions of the people.<p><b>Go, hide in the vineyards:</b><br>The instruction to hide in the vineyards is strategic, as vineyards would provide cover and concealment. Vineyards were common in the region, and their presence indicates the agricultural practices of the time. This setting is significant because it reflects the use of the natural landscape for tactical purposes. The vineyards would have been located near Shiloh, where the annual festival was taking place. This command is part of a larger plan to allow the Benjamites to capture wives during the festival, circumventing the oath made by the Israelites. The use of hiding and ambush tactics is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where God&#8217;s people employ unconventional methods to achieve their goals, such as Gideon&#8217;s battle against the Midianites (Judges 7). This phrase also highlights the tension between human schemes and divine providence in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, which faced near extinction due to a civil war with the other Israelite tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel who, after a conflict with the Benjamites, sought to find wives for the remaining men of Benjamin to preserve the tribe.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyards.htm">Vineyards</a></b><br>The location where the Benjamites were instructed to hide, playing a strategic role in the plan to find wives for them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/civil_war.htm">Civil War</a></b><br>The internal conflict between the tribe of Benjamin and the other Israelite tribes, which led to the near destruction of Benjamin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The place where the annual festival of the LORD was held, near which the Benjamites were to find wives.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_redemption.htm">Restoration and Redemption</a></b><br>Despite the severe consequences of sin and conflict, God provides a way for restoration.

Israel had sworn not to give their daughters to Benjamin, yet they couldn&#8217;t bear to see an entire tribe vanish (<a href="/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The conjunction signals a turning point: the elders are moving from grief to action. We hear the same pivot in accounts where God&#8217;s people finally respond&#8212;think of &#8220;so the people took their dough&#8221; when leaving Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>) or &#8220;so Joshua rose&#8221; to confront Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3-4</a>). Each time, obedience follows realization.<p>&#8226; Here, &#8220;so&#8221; frames a plan that preserves tribal identity without breaking an oath. God&#8217;s faithfulness to keep His promises to all twelve tribes (<a href="/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a>) is reflected, even amid human messiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they commanded the Benjamites:</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;They&#8221; refers to the assembly of Israel&#8217;s elders and warriors (<a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; 21:13-15). The same group that nearly annihilated Benjamin now seeks its restoration&#8212;a sobering reminder that discipline and mercy can flow from one source (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Issuing a command shows the remaining Benjamite men are still under covenant authority, not rogue survivors. God&#8217;s order for Israel involved shared responsibility across tribes (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The directive also underlines that reconciliation requires decisive leadership. Compare Nehemiah&#8217;s firm instructions for rebuilding Jerusalem&#8217;s wall (<a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17-18</a>). When God&#8217;s people have drifted, clear guidance leads them back toward wholeness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go,</b><p>&#8226; A simple imperative&#8212;movement is essential. Staying passive would mean certain extinction for Benjamin. Scripture often pairs God&#8217;s restoration with a command to move: &#8220;Go in this strength of yours&#8221; to Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14</a>) or Jesus&#8217; &#8220;Go &#8230; make disciples&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience begins with stepping out, even when the plan feels unconventional. Faith acts (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>hide in the vineyards</b><p>&#8226; The strategy echoes earlier ambush tactics against Gibeah (<a href="/judges/20-29.htm">Judges 20:29-30</a>) and Joshua&#8217;s surprise attack on Ai from the vineyards and valleys (<a href="/joshua/8-4.htm">Joshua 8:4, 12</a>). Crouching among vines provides natural cover and sets the stage for a swift snatching of brides during Shiloh&#8217;s festival dances (<a href="/judges/21-21.htm">Judges 21:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Vineyards in Scripture symbolize both blessing and vulnerability&#8212;places of God-given fruit (<a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>) yet needing protection (<a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>). Ironically, the site of abundance becomes a hiding place for a tribe fighting to survive.<p>&#8226; The command is practical&#8212;Benjamite numbers are too small to negotiate brides openly&#8212;but it also exposes Israel&#8217;s spiritual poverty: they must resort to subterfuge because earlier rash vows boxed them in (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, God works through imperfect means. Just as the cross looked like defeat but achieved redemption (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>), this awkward vineyard ambush preserves Benjamin so that a future king, Saul, will rise (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/21-20.htm">Judges 21:20</a> captures a pivotal moment where Israel moves from regret to rescue.
