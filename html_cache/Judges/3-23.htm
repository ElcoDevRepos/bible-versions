The porch likely refers to a private chamber or antechamber leading out from the upper room where the assassination took place. This action signifies Ehud's strategic planning and stealth, as he needed to escape without arousing suspicion. The porch may have been part of a larger palace complex, indicating the wealth and power of Eglon. Ehud's escape through the porch highlights his cunning and resourcefulness, qualities that were essential for a leader chosen by God to deliver Israel from oppression.<p><b>closing and locking the doors of the upper room behind him</b><br>Ehud's act of closing and locking the doors was a tactical move to delay the discovery of Eglon's death. The upper room was a place of privacy and security, often used for important meetings or personal retreats. By locking the doors, Ehud ensured that Eglon's servants would assume the king was occupied, buying him time to escape. This action reflects the wisdom and foresight that God often grants to those He appoints for His purposes. The locked doors also symbolize the finality of Eglon's judgment and the deliverance of Israel from Moabite domination. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who, like Ehud, was an unexpected savior who brought freedom through unconventional means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed judge of Israel from the tribe of Benjamin, chosen by God to deliver Israel from Moabite oppression.

The Chaldee represents it by a transliteration of the Greek word <span class= "ital">exedra, </span>"a hall decorated with pillars." Kimchi supposes it to mean an ante-chamber where people waited to see the king, standing in order; and this seems to be the view of the LXX.
