The act of proclaiming in the hearing of the men signifies transparency and public accountability. It reflects the biblical principle that God often communicates His will through chosen leaders, as seen with Moses and Joshua.<p><b>&#8216;Whoever is fearful and trembling may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This directive aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/20-8.htm">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>, where soldiers who are fearful are allowed to return home, ensuring that only the courageous remain. Fear can be contagious, and God desires a committed and faithful remnant. Mount Gilead, though not the exact location of the battle, symbolizes a place of decision and separation. This moment foreshadows the New Testament teaching of counting the cost of discipleship (<a href="/luke/14-25.htm">Luke 14:25-33</a>).<p><b>So twenty-two thousand of them turned back,</b><br>The large number of men who leave highlights human nature's tendency towards fear and self-preservation. It underscores the biblical theme that God often works through a faithful few rather than a multitude, as seen in the stories of Noah, Abraham, and the early church. This reduction in numbers sets the stage for God to demonstrate His power and glory through a smaller, more dedicated group.<p><b>but ten thousand remained.</b><br>The remaining ten thousand represent a remnant, a recurring theme in Scripture where God preserves a faithful group to accomplish His purposes. This remnant is reminiscent of the faithful few in Israel's history, such as the 7,000 who did not bow to Baal in Elijah's time (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>). It also points to the concept of the "remnant" in eschatological prophecy, where a faithful group is preserved through trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The judge chosen by God to lead Israel against the Midianites.

The verse assures believers that God often works through a committed remnant, proving His glory in situations where numbers, resources, and human confidence fall short.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Whosoever is fearful and afraid.</span>--This proclamation is in exact accordance with <a href="/deuteronomy/20-8.htm" title="And the officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return to his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.">Deuteronomy 20:8</a> (and the other general directions in that chapter). It is there founded on the psychological observation that cowardice is exceedingly contagious, so that the presence of timid men in an army is a source of direct danger. The same rule was rigidly observed by the faithful Judas Maccabaeus (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-56.htm" title="But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according to the law.">1 Maccabees 3:56</a>). Epaminondas, for the same reason, made the same proclamation before the battle of Leuctra. In this instance there was the further reason given in the previous verse. "The ancients had observed that even when there are many legions it is always the few that win the battle" (Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. xiv.</span> 36).<p><span class= "bld">Depart early.</span>--The Hebrew word <span class= "ital">tsaphar </span>occurs here only. The Chaldee explains it by <span class= "ital">tsiphra, </span>"in the morning;" and Abarband says that this injunction was given in order that they might not incur shame when they retired. The rendering "hastily" is explained to mean "like a bird" (<span class= "ital">tsippor</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Keil, connecting it with an Arabic root, makes it mean "slink away by bye-paths." It seems to involve a shade of contempt--"Let him take himself off." (<span class= "ital">Trolle </span>sich: Cassel.)<p><span class= "bld">From mount Gilead.</span>--This expression has caused great difficulty, but the Hebrew cannot mean <span class= "ital">"to </span>mount Gilead," nor yet "<span class= "ital">beyond </span>mount Gilead." The only tenable solution of the difficulty is, (1) to alter the text into "mount Gilboa" (Clericus), or from <span class= "ital">meehar, </span>"from mount," to <span class= "ital">maheer, </span>"speedily" (Michaelis); or (2) to suppose that "mount Gilead" was a rallying-cry of the Manassites in general, for Gilead was a son of Abiezer (<a href="/numbers/26-30.htm" title="These are the sons of Gilead: of Jeezer, the family of the Jeezerites: of Helek, the family of the Helekites:">Numbers 26:30</a>, where Jeezer is merely an error); and hence was derived the name "Gilead" of the trans-Jordanic district which fell to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="/context/joshua/17-5.htm" title="And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;">Joshua 17:5-6</a>). If this be a true conjecture, the phrase "let him depart from mount Gilead" means "let him leave the camp of Manasseh." One more conjecture is that Gilead is an ancient name for Gilboa (Schwarz).<p><span class= "bld">There returned of the people twenty and two thousand.</span>--No detail could more decisively show the terror struck into them by the sight of the Midianite host.
