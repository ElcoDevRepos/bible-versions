His decision to stay until midnight suggests a strategic move, possibly to avoid detection. Midnight often symbolizes a time of transition or divine intervention in Scripture, as seen in the Passover event in <a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-31</a>.<p><b>when he got up, took hold of the doors of the city gate and both gateposts</b><br>The city gate was a symbol of strength and security. By taking hold of the gates, Samson demonstrates his extraordinary God-given strength. Gates were central to a city's defense, and removing them would leave the city vulnerable, symbolizing the power of God over the Philistines.<p><b>and pulled them out, bar and all</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the completeness of Samson's feat. The bar was a locking mechanism, and removing it along with the gates signifies total domination. This act foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over His enemies, reminiscent of Christ's triumph over sin and death.<p><b>Then he put them on his shoulders</b><br>Carrying the gates on his shoulders highlights Samson as a type of Christ, who bore the weight of the world's sins on His shoulders.

By taking the gates to a mountain near Hebron, Samson not only humiliates the Philistines but also symbolically returns the strength and glory to Israel.

The episode reveals God&#8217;s perfect timing, unbeatable strength, and covenant faithfulness&#8212;encouraging believers that no scheme of the enemy can lock in God&#8217;s people when He decides to set them free.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Arose at midnight.</span>--Apparently--but here again the narrative omits all details--he had been told of the plot, and found the gates unguarded; unless we are to suppose that he slew the guards, without awaking the city.<p><span class= "bld">Took.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">grasped </span>or <span class= "ital">seized.</span><p><span class= "bld">The two posts</span>--i.e., the side-posts.<p><span class= "bld">Went away with them, bar and all.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">tore them up, with the bar; </span>the bar was the bar which fastened the two valves together.

It may have been the smaller gate, by the side of the main gate, which he thus tore up. In Mohammedan legend Ali uses the gate of Chaibar as a shield, which may be a sort of confused echo and parallel of this event (Po-cocke, <span class= "ital">Hist.

Pliny, in his <span class= "ital">Natural History </span>(vii. 19), adduces many instances of colossal strength, but in this narrative it is distinctly implied that the strength of Samson was a supernatural gift, arising from his dedication to God. The carrying away the <span class= "ital">gate </span>of his enemies would be understood in the East as a very peculiar insult. "When Almansor took Compostella, he made the Christians carry the gates of St. James's Church on their shoulders to Cordova in sign of his victory" (Ferraras, <span class= "ital">Gesch. von Spanier, </span>iii. 145, quoted by Cassel).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Samson arose at midnight</span>. Possibly the woman had learnt the plot, and gave Samson warning, after the manner of Rahab; or she may have been his betrayer, and reckoned upon retaining him till the morning; anyhow he arose at midnight, when the liers in wait were sleeping securely, and tearing up the two gate-pests, with the gates and the cross-bar attached to them, walked off with them "as far as the top of the hill that is before Hebron." <span class="cmt_word">Took the doors</span>, etc. Rather, <span class="accented">laid hold of.</span> For <span class="cmt_word">went away with them</span>, translate <span class="accented">plucked them up.</span> It is the technical word for plucking up the tent pins. <span class="cmt_word">Bar and all</span>, or, <span class="accented">with the bar.</span> The bar was probably a strong iron or wooden crossbar, which was attached to the posts by a lock, and could only be removed by one that had the key. Samson tore up the posts with the barred gates attached to them, and, putting the whole mass upon his back walked off with it. <span class="cmt_word">The hill that is before Hebron</span>. Hebron "was about nine geographical, or between ten and eleven English, miles from Gaza, situated in a deep, narrow valley, with high hills on either side." It is approached from Gaza over a high ridge, from the top of which Hebron becomes visible, lying in the valley below at fifty minutes' distance. This spot would suit very well the description, "the hill that is before Hebron." Some, however, think that the hill called <span class="accented">el Montar</span>, about three-quarters of an hour from Gaza, on the road to Hebron, is here meant, and that the plain <span class="accented">before Hebron</span> merely means <span class="accented">towards</span>, as in <a href="/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>;
