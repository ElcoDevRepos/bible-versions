The act of looking through a window suggests anticipation and concern. Sisera's mother, a figure of authority in her household, is portrayed in a moment of vulnerability. This scene contrasts with the earlier victory of Deborah and Barak, highlighting the personal cost of war. The window can also symbolize a barrier between her expectations and reality, reflecting the broader theme of divine intervention disrupting human plans.<p><b>she peered through the lattice and lamented:</b><br>The lattice, a common architectural feature in ancient Near Eastern homes, allowed for privacy while providing a view outside. Her peering indicates a deep longing and anxiety, as she awaits news of her son. Lamentation in the Bible often signifies mourning or distress, and here it foreshadows the tragic news she is about to receive. This moment of lament connects to the broader biblical theme of the futility of opposing God's will, as seen in the downfall of those who stand against Israel.<p><b>&#8216;Why is his chariot so long in coming?</b><br>Chariots were symbols of military power and speed in the ancient world. Sisera's mother expected a swift return, indicative of confidence in his military prowess. Her question reveals her ignorance of the divine intervention that led to Sisera's defeat. This phrase echoes the biblical motif of misplaced trust in human strength, as seen in <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which contrasts trust in chariots with trust in the Lord.<p><b>What has delayed the clatter of his chariots?&#8217;</b><br>The clatter of chariots signifies the expected sound of victory and triumph. The delay suggests an unexpected turn of events, highlighting the theme of divine sovereignty over human affairs. This delay is a direct result of God's intervention through Deborah and Barak, emphasizing the futility of relying on human might against divine purpose. The silence of the chariots serves as a metaphor for the ultimate silence of those who oppose God's chosen people, as seen in the prophetic imagery of <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>, where reliance on chariots is condemned.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera's_mother.htm">Sisera's Mother</a></b><br>A figure of maternal concern, she represents the anticipation and anxiety of those who await the return of warriors from battle.

The mother of Sisera and her attendant princesses had looked for the triumph and return of the host as confidently as the ladies of Spain expected the return of the Armada, or as the ladies of Aberdeen sat, "with their fans into their hand," looking out for the sails of Sir Patrick Spens. We have a similar scene in the <span class= "ital">Persians </span>of 'schylus, where the great Atossa wails over the miserable flight of her defeated son Xerxes. In that, however, there is more of pity and less of derision, though, no doubt, the spectacle was meant to be pleasing to the victorious Athenians. This exulting description of the cruel but blighted hopes of the <span class= "ital">women </span>of Sisera's family is an inimitable touch of genuineness; it shows a woman's authorship (Ewald).<p><span class= "bld">Looked out at a window.</span>--Watching for the first glimpse of her son's return.
