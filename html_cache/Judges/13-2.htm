It is situated in the Shephelah, a region of low hills in Israel. This geographical location is significant as it places the narrative within the context of the tribal allotments described in <a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>. Zorah's proximity to Philistine territory is also relevant, as the Philistines were oppressors of Israel during this period (<a href="/judges/13.htm">Judges 13:1</a>).<p><b>named Manoah</b><br>Manoah's name means "rest" or "peace," which is ironic given the turbulent times in which he lived. The introduction of Manoah sets the stage for the birth of Samson, a judge who would begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines. Manoah's role as Samson's father is crucial, as he is involved in the divine instructions regarding Samson's Nazirite vow (<a href="/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3-5</a>).<p><b>from the clan of the Danites</b><br>The Danites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Dan, the son of Jacob and Bilhah (<a href="/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>). The tribe of Dan struggled to secure its allotted territory and later migrated northward (Judges 18). This context highlights the challenges faced by the Danites and sets the stage for Samson's role as a judge who would confront the Philistines, who were encroaching on Israelite land.<p><b>whose wife was barren and had no children</b><br>Barrenness is a recurring theme in the Bible, often preceding the birth of significant figures, such as Isaac (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-3</a>), Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-21.htm">Genesis 25:21</a>), and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-20</a>). This motif underscores the miraculous nature of God's intervention in human affairs. The barrenness of Manoah's wife sets the stage for the angelic announcement of Samson's birth, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the special purpose for which Samson was chosen. This also foreshadows the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ, born to the Virgin Mary, highlighting the theme of divine intervention in salvation history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Dan, living in Zorah.
