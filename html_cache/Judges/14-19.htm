The Spirit's coming upon Samson signifies God's direct intervention, enabling him to perform feats beyond human capability. This empowerment is similar to other judges like Othniel (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>) and Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>). It highlights the sovereignty of God in using flawed individuals for His purposes.<p><b>and he went down to Ashkelon</b><br>Ashkelon was one of the five major Philistine cities, located on the Mediterranean coast. Its mention here underscores the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines. The geographical movement from Samson's location to Ashkelon indicates a deliberate action, possibly reflecting the tension and hostility between the Israelites and the Philistines.<p><b>killed thirty of their men</b><br>This act of violence is a direct consequence of the Spirit's empowerment, showcasing Samson's role as a judge and deliverer of Israel. The number thirty may symbolize completeness or a significant impact, as it provided the exact number of garments needed. This action also foreshadows the ongoing cycle of violence and retaliation between Samson and the Philistines.<p><b>took their apparel</b><br>In ancient times, clothing was a valuable commodity, often used as a form of wealth or barter. By taking the apparel of the slain men, Samson fulfills his obligation from the riddle wager (<a href="/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12-13</a>). This act also signifies a transfer of honor and wealth from the Philistines to Samson, albeit through violent means.<p><b>and gave their clothes to those who had solved the riddle</b><br>This phrase completes the narrative of the riddle challenge, where Samson's wife had coerced the answer from him. The giving of clothes fulfills his promise, albeit through an unexpected and violent method. It highlights the themes of deception and betrayal that run throughout Samson's story.<p><b>And burning with anger</b><br>Samson's anger reflects his personal vendetta and emotional volatility, traits that characterize much of his life. This anger is not just personal but also indicative of the larger conflict between Israel and the Philistines. It sets the stage for further acts of vengeance and conflict in the narrative.<p><b>Samson returned to his father&#8217;s house</b><br>Returning to his father's house signifies a retreat or withdrawal, possibly indicating a temporary cessation of hostilities. It also reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where the father's house was a place of refuge and authority. This return may symbolize a moment of reflection or regrouping before future actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.

Divine justice answers deceit measure for measure.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law demanded life for life (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23</a>). Here, the Philistines&#8217; treachery leads to their own loss of life, emphasizing God&#8217;s righteousness even through a flawed deliverer (cf. <a href="/psalms/94-1.htm">Psalm 94:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Plundered garments given to the riddle-solvers</b><p>&#8226; Samson &#8220;took their apparel, and gave their clothes to those who had solved the riddle.&#8221; The wager in <a href="/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a> required thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes.<p>&#8226; Though the source of the clothing is violent, Samson technically keeps his word, illustrating the biblical principle that vows must be honored (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the episode exposes the emptiness of Philistine celebrations; their revelry ends clothed in the spoils of their own slain kinsmen (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samson&#8217;s burning anger and retreat</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Burning with anger, Samson returned to his father&#8217;s house.&#8221; His fury is not quenched by the slaughter; the betrayal has wounded him deeply.<p>&#8226; The withdrawal signals a broken marriage covenant&#8212;completed formally in 14:20 when his wife is given to another man.<p>&#8226; Anger itself is not sin (<a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>), but Samson&#8217;s unchecked wrath foreshadows future destruction (<a href="/judges/15-6.htm">Judges 15:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lessons for believers</b><p>&#8226; God can work through imperfect people; Samson&#8217;s flaws do not hinder divine purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Betrayal and deceit bear bitter fruit; sowing dishonesty reaps judgment (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Fulfilled vows and righteous anger must be governed by the Spirit lest they spiral into vengeance (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual empowerment never excuses moral compromise; Samson&#8217;s life warns that giftedness without obedience leads to tragedy (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a> records a Spirit-empowered act of judgment in which Samson kills thirty Philistines at Ashkelon to settle his wager after being deceived.
