Manoah's prayer reflects a sincere desire for guidance, and God's response underscores His willingness to engage with those who seek Him earnestly. This aligns with passages such as 1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14</a>, which assures believers that God hears their prayers when they ask according to His will. The narrative also echoes the story of Hannah in <a href="/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1</a>, where God listens to her plea for a child.<p><b>and the angel of God returned to the woman</b><br>The "angel of God" is a significant figure in the Old Testament, often seen as a theophany, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This angel had previously appeared to Manoah's wife, announcing the birth of Samson, a deliverer for Israel. The return of the angel signifies the importance of the message and the divine orchestration in the events leading to Samson's birth. This mirrors other biblical instances where God sends His messengers to deliver critical messages, such as the angel Gabriel's announcements in <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a>.<p><b>as she was sitting in the field</b><br>The setting of the field may symbolize a place of solitude and reflection, away from the distractions of daily life. Fields are often depicted in Scripture as places where significant encounters with God occur, such as Moses with the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>. This setting emphasizes the personal nature of divine encounters and the accessibility of God to individuals in their everyday environments.<p><b>but her husband Manoah was not with her</b><br>This detail highlights the separate experiences of Manoah and his wife, emphasizing the personal nature of divine revelation. It also sets the stage for Manoah's later encounter with the angel, where he seeks confirmation and understanding of the message given to his wife. This separation can be seen as a test of faith and trust in the divine message, similar to how Mary and Joseph received separate angelic announcements regarding the birth of Jesus in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity who listens to the prayers of His people and orchestrates events according to His divine plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Dan, husband to the barren woman, who earnestly seeks God's guidance regarding the promised child.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_god.htm">The Angel of God</a></b><br>A divine messenger, often understood as a theophany or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, who delivers God's message to Manoah's wife.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman (Manoah's Wife)</a></b><br>A barren woman chosen by God to bear Samson, a future judge of Israel, highlighting God's power to bring life and purpose.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>The setting where the Angel of God appears to the woman, symbolizing a place of divine encounter and revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_hears_and_responds.htm">God Hears and Responds</a></b><br>God listens to the prayers of His people, as seen in Manoah's plea.

Scripture assures us that &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their cry&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s immediate response underscores His attentiveness to sincere, faith-filled prayer. Compare <a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>, where the Lord &#8220;remembered&#8221; Hannah, and <a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a>, where He &#8220;remembered&#8221; Rachel. In each case, God did not merely acknowledge the prayer; He acted.<p>&#8226; The passage reminds us that praying husbands and fathers have a crucial role. Like Job interceding for his children (<a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>), Manoah sought divine help, and God heard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the angel of God returned to the woman</b><p>&#8226; The same messenger who first announced Samson&#8217;s birth (<a href="/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3</a>) comes back, demonstrating that God completes what He begins (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows a pattern of angelic reassurance: Hagar meets the angel a second time in <a href="/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>; Zechariah sees Gabriel again in <a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>. Each return confirms God&#8217;s steadfast commitment.<p>&#8226; Angels in the Old Testament often foreshadow the Lord&#8217;s personal involvement, as in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>; the &#8220;angel of God&#8221; speaks with divine authority, reinforcing that this is God Himself ensuring the promise is clear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as she was sitting in the field</b><p>&#8226; The woman is not in a shrine or temple but an ordinary field&#8212;echoing moments like Ruth gleaning in Boaz&#8217;s field (<a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a>) and Isaac meditating in the open country (<a href="/genesis/24-63.htm">Genesis 24:63</a>). God meets people where they are.<p>&#8226; Her posture of quiet waiting contrasts with Manoah&#8217;s earlier activity. Stillness can be the setting for revelation: &#8220;Be still, and know that I am God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The field hints at future harvest. Samson will become the initial &#8220;harvest&#8221; of deliverance from the Philistines (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>), linking the scene to God&#8217;s broader redemptive work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but her husband Manoah was not with her</b><p>&#8226; The repeated absence of Manoah (<a href="/judges/13-10.htm">Judges 13:10</a>) emphasizes that God speaks directly to the woman, affirming her spiritual agency&#8212;similar to the angel&#8217;s personal words to Mary in <a href="/luke/1-28.htm">Luke 1:28</a>.<p>&#8226; Manoah&#8217;s absence sets up a lesson in trust. Like Abraham learning from Sarah&#8217;s private encounter (<a href="/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9-10</a>), Manoah must rely on his wife&#8217;s testimony until he, too, meets the angel.<p>&#8226; This detail warns against over-reliance on secondhand faith. Manoah will soon seek his own confirmation (<a href="/judges/13-11.htm">Judges 13:11-12</a>), illustrating that every believer needs a personal walk with God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/13-9.htm">Judges 13:9</a> shows a God who hears, answers, and guides with precision. He responds to Manoah&#8217;s earnest prayer, sends His messenger again to verify the promise, meets the woman in the ordinariness of a field, and invites Manoah to deeper personal engagement. The verse reassures us that God is attentive, persistent, and relational, working through both men and women to fulfill His redemptive purposes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
