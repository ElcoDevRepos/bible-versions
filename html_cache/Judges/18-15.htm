In the context of Judges, the tribe of Dan was seeking a new territory to inhabit, as their allotted land was insufficient. This turning aside can be seen as a metaphor for Israel's frequent turning away from God's commands during the period of the Judges, a time marked by moral and spiritual decline.<p><b>and went to the home of the young Levite</b><br>The young Levite mentioned here is significant because Levites were set apart for religious duties in Israel. However, this Levite is not serving in a traditional Levitical role, highlighting the spiritual confusion and disorder of the time. His presence in Micah's house, rather than in a Levitical city or serving at the tabernacle, underscores the theme of religious apostasy. This Levite's actions contrast with the intended role of Levites as described in <a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>.<p><b>the house of Micah</b><br>Micah's house is central to the narrative in <a href="/judges/17.htm">Judges 17-18</a>. Micah had created a shrine with an idol, which was against the commandments given to Israel (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). This setting reflects the syncretism and idolatry prevalent in Israel during the Judges period. Micah's actions and the presence of the Levite in his house illustrate the departure from true worship and the blending of pagan practices with the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>and greeted him</b><br>The greeting of the Levite by the Danites suggests a level of familiarity or acceptance, which may indicate the Levite's reputation or the Danites' recognition of his role in Micah's household. This interaction foreshadows the Danites' later actions, where they will take both the Levite and Micah's idols for themselves, further demonstrating the moral and spiritual chaos of the time. The greeting can also be seen as a prelude to the negotiation and eventual recruitment of the Levite by the Danites, reflecting the transactional nature of religious leadership in this period.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>A group from the tribe of Dan seeking a new territory to settle, as their allotted land was insufficient.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>An Ephraimite who had established a private shrine with idols and hired a Levite to be his priest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_levite.htm">The Young Levite</a></b><br>A Levite from Bethlehem in Judah who became a priest for Micah's household.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_micah.htm">The House of Micah</a></b><br>Located in the hill country of Ephraim, it served as a private place of worship with unauthorized religious practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>The Danites were on a mission to find a new land, and their encounter with Micah's house was a pivotal moment in their journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry can subtly infiltrate our lives when we prioritize anything above God.
