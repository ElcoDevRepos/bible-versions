This pursuit follows the battle at Mount Tabor, where God delivered Sisera's forces into Barak's hands. The context highlights God's sovereignty in delivering Israel from oppression, as prophesied by Deborah, the judge and prophetess. Barak's pursuit signifies the fulfillment of God's promise of victory.<p><b>Jael went out to greet him</b><br>Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, plays a pivotal role in this narrative. Her actions are significant because the Kenites were at peace with Jabin, the Canaanite king. Jael's greeting of Barak indicates her allegiance to Israel, despite her husband's alliance. This act of hospitality and boldness is culturally significant, as women in ancient Near Eastern societies were often expected to remain in the background.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;Come, and I will show you the man you are seeking.&#8221;</b><br>Jael's invitation to Barak is direct and confident. Her words fulfill Deborah's prophecy that a woman would claim the honor of defeating Sisera. This moment underscores the theme of unexpected deliverance and the use of unlikely individuals to accomplish God's purposes. It also highlights the role of women in God's redemptive history.<p><b>So he went in with her</b><br>Barak's entry into Jael's tent signifies his acceptance of her guidance and the unfolding of God's plan. In the cultural context, entering a woman's tent was unusual for a man, indicating the urgency and importance of the situation. This action demonstrates Barak's trust in Jael's revelation and God's orchestration of events.<p><b>and there lay Sisera dead, with a tent peg through his temple.</b><br>Sisera's death by Jael's hand is a dramatic and unexpected conclusion to the pursuit. The tent peg, a common household item, becomes a tool of divine justice. This act fulfills Deborah's prophecy and symbolizes the downfall of Israel's oppressors. The imagery of the tent peg through the temple is stark and emphasizes the finality of God's judgment. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory over evil through Christ, who uses the humble and unexpected to achieve His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barak.htm">Barak</a></b><br>A military leader of Israel who, under the guidance of the prophetess Deborah, pursued the Canaanite army led by Sisera.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>The commander of the Canaanite army, who fled the battlefield and sought refuge in the tent of Jael.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jael.htm">Jael</a></b><br>The wife of Heber the Kenite, who played a pivotal role in the defeat of Sisera by killing him with a tent peg.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heber_the_kenite.htm">Heber the Kenite</a></b><br>Jael's husband, whose family was at peace with King Jabin of Canaan, Sisera's superior.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent.htm">The Tent</a></b><br>The setting where Jael executed her decisive act, symbolizing a place of refuge turned into a place of judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_uses_unexpected_instruments.htm">God Uses Unexpected Instruments</a></b><br>Jael, a non-Israelite woman, becomes the instrument of God's deliverance, reminding us that God can use anyone, regardless of background or status, to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_obedience.htm">Courage in Obedience</a></b><br>Jael's bold action demonstrates the courage required to act in alignment with God's will, even when it involves personal risk or unconventional methods.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophecy_fulfilled.htm">Prophecy Fulfilled</a></b><br>The fulfillment of Deborah's prophecy through Jael underscores the reliability of God's word and the certainty of His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_women_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Women in God's Plan</a></b><br>This passage highlights the significant roles women can play in God's redemptive history, challenging cultural norms and expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_over_evil.htm">Victory Over Evil</a></b><br>Sisera's defeat symbolizes the ultimate victory of God's people over their oppressors, encouraging believers to trust in God's deliverance in their own battles.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_4_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 4:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_4_22_God_s_surprise_deliverance.htm">How does Judges 4:22 demonstrate God's deliverance through unexpected means?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_God_s_sovereignty_in_Jael_s_act.htm">What can we learn about God's sovereignty from Jael's actions in Judges 4:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Judges_4_22_to_4_9_promise.htm">How does Judges 4:22 connect to God's promise in Judges 4:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trust_God_s_plan_amid_challenges_3.htm">How can we trust God's plan when facing overwhelming challenges today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Judges_4_22_Courage_obedience_to_God.htm">What does Judges 4:22 teach about courage and obedience in serving God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Judges_4_22_God_s_justice_shown.htm">How does Judges 4:22 reflect God's justice and judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Jael_show_God_s_use_of_unlikely_tools.htm">What does Jael's action in Judges 4:22 reveal about God's use of unlikely instruments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Judges_4_22_and_gender_roles.htm">How does Judges 4:22 challenge traditional gender roles in biblical narratives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_judges_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Judges 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_sisera_in_the_bible.htm">Who was Sisera in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_judges_4_9_a_later_editorial_addition.htm">Judges 4:9 features a prophecy about Sisera&#8217;s defeat by a woman&#8212;could this be a later editorial addition that conflicts with the main story?

The scene which thus describes the undaunted murderess standing in the tent between the dead and the living chieftains--and glorying in the decision which had led her to fling to the winds every rule of Eastern morality and decorum--is a very striking one.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/4-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Barak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1511;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#257;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1301.htm">Strong's 1301: </a> </span><span class="str2">Barak -- 'flash of lightning', an Israelite leader</span><br /><br /><span class="word">arrived in pursuit of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7291.htm">Strong's 7291: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pursue, chase, persecute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Sisera,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1505;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#238;&#183;s&#601;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5516.htm">Strong's 5516: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sisera -- a general of the king of Hazor, also the father of some returning exiles</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jael</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3278.htm">Strong's 3278: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jael -- a Canaanite woman</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
