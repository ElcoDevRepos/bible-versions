The context is the period after Joshua's leadership, where the Israelites failed to fully obey God's command to drive out all the inhabitants of the Promised Land. This decision served as a test for Israel, to see if they would remain faithful to God amidst pagan influences. The presence of these nations was also a means to teach warfare to the new generations of Israelites who had not experienced the battles of the conquest (<a href="/judges/3.htm">Judges 3:1-2</a>).<p><b>and had not driven them out immediately</b><br>The immediate removal of these nations was not executed, highlighting a divine purpose in the delay. This delay was not due to God's inability but rather served as a consequence of Israel's disobedience and a test of their faithfulness. It also provided an opportunity for Israel to demonstrate their reliance on God rather than their own strength. The gradual process of driving out the nations is reminiscent of God's promise in <a href="/exodus/23-29.htm">Exodus 23:29-30</a>, where He stated that He would not drive them out in a single year to prevent the land from becoming desolate.<p><b>by delivering them into the hand of Joshua</b><br>Joshua, as the leader of Israel, was initially tasked with the conquest of Canaan. His leadership was marked by significant victories, yet the complete conquest was not achieved during his lifetime. This phrase underscores the transition from Joshua's leadership to the period of the Judges, where the responsibility of driving out the remaining nations fell to the tribes of Israel. The mention of Joshua serves as a reminder of the initial divine mandate and the partial fulfillment of God's promises through him. Joshua is often seen as a type of Christ, leading God's people into the Promised Land, just as Jesus leads believers into spiritual rest and victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is sovereign over all nations and peoples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Canaanite nations that were left in the land of Israel.

God&#8217;s earlier victories through Joshua stood as proof that total triumph was possible whenever Israel trusted and obeyed. The same God who had &#8220;delivered&#8221; before could&#8212;and would&#8212;do so again (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>), but His people had to walk in faithful partnership (<a href="/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/2-23.htm">Judges 2:23</a> teaches that God intentionally left certain enemy nations so Israel might be tested, trained, and taught to rely on Him over time.
