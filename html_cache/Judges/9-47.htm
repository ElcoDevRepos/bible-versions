His ambition and ruthless nature are evident throughout <a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>. The phrase indicates that Abimelech received intelligence about the movements of his enemies. This reflects the political intrigue and espionage common in ancient Near Eastern warfare. Abimelech's leadership style contrasts sharply with that of his father, Gideon, who was called by God to deliver Israel. Abimelech's rule, however, was self-appointed and marked by violence and treachery.<p><b>that all the leaders in the tower of Shechem</b><br>The "leaders" here refers to the men of Shechem who had initially supported Abimelech's rise to power. The "tower of Shechem" is likely a fortified structure within the city, used as a place of refuge and defense. Shechem itself is a city with deep historical and religious significance, being a site of covenant renewal (Joshua 24) and a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>). The gathering of the leaders in the tower suggests a defensive posture, indicating their fear of Abimelech's wrath after their betrayal.<p><b>were gathered there</b><br>The gathering of the leaders in the tower signifies a last stand against Abimelech's forces. This act of seeking refuge in a stronghold is a common ancient practice during sieges. The leaders' decision to gather in the tower reflects their desperation and the gravity of the situation. This event foreshadows the impending judgment and destruction that Abimelech will bring upon them, fulfilling the curse of Jotham, Gideon's youngest son, who prophesied doom upon Abimelech and the men of Shechem for their treachery (<a href="/judges/9-20.htm">Judges 9:20</a>). This narrative highlights themes of divine justice and the consequences of ungodly leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

(<a href="/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47</a>).<p>&#8226; The report underscores God&#8217;s providence; nothing occurs outside His oversight (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Abimelech, though a self-made tyrant, still moves only after receiving information, reminding us that even the wicked act within limits set by God (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His immediate response mirrors earlier ruthless decisions (cf. <a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1-6</a>), revealing a hardened heart that has ignored the warning in Jotham&#8217;s parable (<a href="/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that all the leaders</b><p>&#8220;All the leaders&#8221; points to the city&#8217;s power brokers who once crowned Abimelech (<a href="/judges/9-3.htm">Judges 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Their flight shows how quickly worldly alliances crumble (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Their gathering together echoes the earlier coalition against Gideon&#8217;s house (<a href="/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33-34</a>) and highlights the principle that sin eventually circles back on the sinner (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the tower of Shechem</b><p>&#8226; The tower was a fortified stronghold within the city, a last-resort refuge (cf. <a href="/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses towers as metaphors for safety (<a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>), yet here the very structure that should protect them becomes the stage for judgment, illustrating the folly of trusting human defenses over the Lord (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Their choice of refuge also recalls the men of Penuel&#8217;s tower whom Gideon once punished for unbelief (<a href="/judges/8-17.htm">Judges 8:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were gathered there</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Gathered&#8221; signals a defensive huddle, but also a prophetic convergence for judgment (<a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Their unity cannot save them, foreshadowing Abimelech&#8217;s brutal response (<a href="/judges/9-48.htm">Judges 9:48-49</a>) and echoing <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-5</a>, where rebellious gatherings meet divine derision.<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us of <a href="/luke/13-4.htm">Luke 13:4</a>, where people perished when a tower fell&#8212;another moment showing that physical safety is never ultimate without spiritual refuge in God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47</a> records the moment when Abimelech learns that Shechem&#8217;s leaders have barricaded themselves in the city&#8217;s tower. Every phrase exposes layers of irony and divine justice: the very men who empowered a tyrant now cower under the roof they trusted; the stronghold they relied on becomes the trap God will use to complete their judgment. The verse teaches that no earthly alliance or fortress can shield the unrepentant from the righteous consequences of sin, while simultaneously affirming the Lord&#8217;s complete authority over every detail of human history.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/9-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when it was reported</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1467;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yug&#183;ga&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hofal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Abimelech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1462;&#1425;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_40.htm">Strong's 40: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abimelech -- 'father is king', a Philistine name, also an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the leaders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1167.htm">Strong's 1167: </a> </span><span class="str2">A master, a husband, owner</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the tower</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7713;&#183;dal-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4026.htm">Strong's 4026: </a> </span><span class="str2">A tower, a rostrum, a, bed of flowers</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Shechem</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7927.htm">Strong's 7927: </a> </span><span class="str2">Shechem -- 'ridge', a district in Northern Palestine, also a son of Hamor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were gathered there,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1469;&#1514;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#7791;&#183;qab&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6908.htm">Strong's 6908: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gather, collect</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/9-47.htm">OT History: Judges 9:47 It was told Abimelech that all (Jd Judg.
