The "great blow" indicates a decisive and overwhelming defeat of the Ammonites. In the context of the Book of Judges, this victory is seen as a deliverance by God, who empowers Jephthah to lead Israel to triumph. The number "twenty" may symbolize completeness or a significant portion of the enemy's territory, emphasizing the thoroughness of the victory.<p><b>from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith</b><br>Aroer is a city located on the northern bank of the Arnon River, marking the southern boundary of the territory involved in this conflict. Minnith is believed to be further north, possibly near the Ammonite territory. This geographical range indicates the extensive area over which Jephthah's campaign was successful. The mention of these locations provides historical and geographical context, showing the breadth of the victory and the strategic importance of these areas in the conflict between Israel and Ammon.<p><b>as far as Abel-keramim</b><br>Abel-keramim, meaning "meadow of vineyards," suggests a fertile area, possibly indicating the prosperity of the region before the conflict. The mention of this location further delineates the extent of Jephthah's campaign. The destruction reaching this far demonstrates the complete subjugation of the Ammonite forces and the thoroughness of the victory. This also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel from its oppressors.<p><b>So the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites</b><br>This phrase concludes the account of Jephthah's victory, emphasizing the subjugation of the Ammonites. The subduing of the Ammonites is a recurring theme in the Book of Judges, where God raises leaders to deliver Israel from foreign oppression. This victory is seen as a divine intervention, reinforcing the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of Israel's disobedience and the mercy of God in providing deliverance. The subjugation of the Ammonites foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, as Jephthah serves as a type of Christ, delivering his people from their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and military prowess.
