This reflects the intimate nature of prayer and petition in the Old Testament, where God often spoke directly to His people.<p><b>&#8220;Do not be angry with me;</b><br>Gideon is aware of the potential for divine displeasure, showing his reverence and fear of the Lord. This echoes Abraham's cautious approach when interceding for Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-30.htm">Genesis 18:30-32</a>), indicating a deep respect for God's holiness and authority.<p><b>let me speak one more time.</b><br>Gideon's request for another sign demonstrates his need for reassurance. This reflects human frailty and the struggle with doubt, even among those chosen by God. It also shows God's patience and willingness to confirm His will to those who seek Him earnestly.<p><b>Please allow me one more test with the fleece.</b><br>The fleece test is a unique method of seeking confirmation from God. It symbolizes Gideon's desire for certainty in his calling to deliver Israel.

It highlights God's control over nature and His ability to perform wonders.<p><b>and the ground covered with dew.&#8221;</b><br>The presence of dew on the ground while the fleece remains dry serves as a divine confirmation of Gideon's mission.
