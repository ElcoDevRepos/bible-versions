The servants' delay suggests a divine intervention, allowing Ehud to complete his mission. This moment reflects the recurring theme in Judges of God raising up deliverers for Israel. Ehud's left-handedness, mentioned earlier in the chapter, was unusual and played a crucial role in his ability to conceal his weapon and execute his plan. This escape can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who also used unexpected means to achieve victory.<p><b>He passed by the idols</b><br>The mention of idols indicates the pervasive idolatry in the land, which was a constant snare for Israel. These idols, likely representing Canaanite deities, were a physical manifestation of the spiritual battle Israel faced. The fact that Ehud passed by them without incident suggests his focus on God's mission rather than the false gods of the land. This can be seen as a call for believers to remain steadfast in their faith amidst a world filled with distractions and false idols.<p><b>and escaped to Seirah.</b><br>Seirah, though not extensively detailed in biblical records, is understood to be a wooded or mountainous region, providing Ehud with a strategic advantage for concealment and regrouping. This location underscores the importance of geography in biblical narratives, where natural features often play a role in God's deliverance. Ehud's successful escape to Seirah allowed him to rally the Israelites and lead them to victory over the Moabites, demonstrating God's faithfulness in using unlikely individuals and circumstances to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed judge of Israel who delivered the Israelites from Moabite oppression by assassinating King Eglon of Moab.

Yahweh&#8217;s plan for Israel&#8217;s freedom could not be thwarted, echoing earlier rescues such as Moses leading Israel out (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>) and Joshua&#8217;s victories (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights God-given ingenuity in His servants&#8212;see David eluding Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>) and Paul slipping from Damascus in a basket (<a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>). Ehud&#8217;s escape reminds readers that the Lord equips His people with both courage and strategy (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>While the servants waited</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;while the servants waited&#8221; (v. 26b).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s attendants assumed their master was safe, paralleling Samson&#8217;s foes who trusted locked gates (<a href="/judges/16-3.htm">Judges 16:3</a>). God&#8217;s timing turned their complacency into a shield for Ehud, similar to how the Arameans were struck with blindness while Elisha&#8217;s plans unfolded (<a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The pause underscores how the Lord can confound enemies with simple delays (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a>). Israel&#8217;s oppressor is already defeated, yet still oblivious&#8212;an echo of Pharaoh realizing too late that Israel has gone (<a href="/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He passed by the idols</b><p>&#8220;He passed by the idols&#8221; (v. 26c).<p>&#8226; These idols, likely sacred stones near Gilgal (<a href="/judges/3-19.htm">Judges 3:19</a>), symbolize the gods Moab trusted. Ehud&#8217;s unhindered exit past them highlights their impotence, just as Dagon toppled before the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3-4</a>) and Baal remained silent on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26-29</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s servant walking safely by false gods reinforces the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>) and the theme that &#8220;all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Escaped to Seirah</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and escaped to Seirah&#8221; (v. 26d).<p>&#8226; Seirah lay in the hill country of Ephraim (<a href="/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>). Reaching this rugged terrain gave Ehud a strategic vantage, much like Deborah and Barak rallied Israel from Mount Tabor (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The secure location allowed Ehud to summon the tribes with a trumpet (v. 27), comparable to Gideon&#8217;s call at Ophrah (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>). God frequently provides both a place of safety and a platform for the next step&#8212;think of Elijah at Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8-18</a>) or Jesus withdrawing across the Jordan before returning to Jerusalem (<a href="/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40-42</a>; 11:7-8).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/3-26.htm">Judges 3:26</a> portrays God&#8217;s deliverance in motion: His chosen judge slips free, enemy complacency buys precious minutes, powerless idols line the escape route, and a God-appointed refuge sets the stage for Israel&#8217;s victory. Each phrase reinforces the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty, the futility of false gods, and the wisdom of trusting His leading from start to finish.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Unto Seirath.</span>--Perhaps, rather, <span class= "ital">into the bush, </span>or <span class= "ital">woodland, </span>as the word has the article, and does not occur again.
