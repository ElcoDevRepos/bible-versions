The context is the aftermath of a significant victory over the Midianites, where Gideon is dealing with the captured kings, Zebah and Zalmunna. In ancient Near Eastern culture, it was common for a leader to involve his son in acts of justice or vengeance to establish his role and authority. The act of killing these kings would have been a rite of passage for Jether, signifying his transition into manhood and warrior status. This moment also reflects the harsh realities of the time, where familial honor and the continuation of leadership were often demonstrated through acts of retribution.<p><b>But the young man did not draw his sword;</b><br>Jether's hesitation is significant. In the cultural context, drawing a sword was not just an act of violence but a demonstration of courage and readiness to assume responsibility. His reluctance may indicate his lack of experience or readiness to take on the mantle of leadership. This moment contrasts with other biblical figures who were called to action at a young age, such as David, who faced Goliath with confidence. Jether's inaction highlights the human element of fear and the challenges of stepping into roles of authority.<p><b>he was fearful because he was still a youth.</b><br>Jether's fear is understandable given his youth and the gravity of the task. The Bible often acknowledges the fear and hesitation of young individuals called to significant roles, such as Jeremiah, who expressed his youth and inexperience when called to be a prophet (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6-7</a>). This phrase underscores the theme of human weakness and the need for divine strength, a recurring motif in Scripture. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of preparation and maturity in leadership roles. The narrative does not condemn Jether but rather presents a realistic portrayal of the challenges faced by those called to fulfill God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

As firstborn, Jether carried special responsibility and honor (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>). Gideon&#8217;s request places Jether at the forefront of justice, much like Joshua invited his commanders to place their feet on the necks of defeated kings (<a href="/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>). By naming Jether, Scripture highlights family leadership and the expectation that the next generation would act in faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Get up and kill them</b><p>The &#8220;them&#8221; refers to Zebah and Zalmunna, Midianite kings who had ravaged Israel (<a href="/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5</a>). Executing captured kings was standard in ancient warfare (<a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>). Gideon wants the honor&#8212;and the humbling of the enemy&#8212;to rest on his household. This echoes <a href="/numbers/31-3.htm">Numbers 31:3</a>, where Israel&#8217;s leaders personally avenge national wrongs. The command also serves as a test of courage and obedience reminiscent of Abraham&#8217;s willingness to act when told, &#8220;Take your son&#8230; and offer him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the young man did not draw his sword</b><p>Jether hesitates. His inaction contrasts sharply with David, who &#8220;ran quickly toward the battle line&#8221; against Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>). In Judges, human weakness repeatedly magnifies God&#8217;s strength (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>). Jether&#8217;s pause underlines that victory and judgment ultimately belong to the Lord, not human prowess (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was fearful</b><p>Fear is a common, honest response throughout Scripture. Moses feared Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/2-14.htm">Exodus 2:14&#8211;15</a>), and Jeremiah trembled at his call (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>). Gideon himself needed angelic reassurance and multiple signs (<a href="/judges/6-17.htm">Judges 6:17&#8211;23, 36</a>&#8211;40). God does not conceal His servants&#8217; frailties; He records them to urge dependence on Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because he was still a youth</b><p>Jether&#8217;s age explains, though does not excuse, his fear. Youth offers zeal yet often lacks seasoned courage (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). Unlike David, who as a youth trusted God fully (<a href="/1_samuel/17-33.htm">1 Samuel 17:33&#8211;37</a>), Jether falters. His example gently warns that maturity in faith, not merely age or position, equips believers for decisive obedience (<a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/8-20.htm">Judges 8:20</a> captures a moment where Gideon seeks to involve his firstborn in God-ordained justice. The verse spotlights family responsibility, the call to courageous obedience, and the reality of youthful fear. Though Jether shrank back, the inspired narrative underscores that victory rests on God&#8217;s power, while His people&#8212;of every generation&#8212;are invited to step forward in faith when He leads.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And he said unto Jether.</span>--By the <span class= "ital">jus talionis. </span>as well as by every other consideration of that time, Gideon, as the last survivor of all his kingly brothers, would hold himself justified in putting his captives to death. Jether also would inherit the duties of goel (<a href="/numbers/35-12.htm" title="And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.">Numbers 35:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-22.htm" title="And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: why should I smite you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?">2Samuel 2:22</a>, &c), and Gideon desired both to train the boy to fearlessness against the enemies of Israel (<a href="/context/joshua/10-24.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.

Gideon must only be judged by the standard and the customs of his own day. (Comp. <a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm" title="And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.">1Samuel 15:33</a>, Samuel and Agag; <a href="/2_samuel/1-15.htm" title="And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him.

But it is well for us to be made aware how the best and greatest men cannot rise above the manners and received maxims of their age; and it teaches us to make due allowance for the faults of uncivilised men with whom we have to do, whether Afghans, or Zulus, or others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So he said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
