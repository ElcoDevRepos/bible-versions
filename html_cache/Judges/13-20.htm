In the Old Testament, fire often symbolizes God's presence and approval, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a> when fire came from the LORD to consume the burnt offering. The altar here is significant, as altars were central to worship and sacrifice in Israelite culture, serving as a place of meeting between God and man. The upward movement of the flame signifies a connection between heaven and earth, reminiscent of the smoke of sacrifices rising to God as a pleasing aroma (<a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>).<p><b>the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame</b><br>The angel of the LORD is a mysterious figure in the Old Testament, often considered a theophany, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This ascension in the flame signifies divine authority and power, as well as the angel's heavenly origin. The angel's actions here parallel the ascension of Christ in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>), symbolizing the return to the heavenly realm. The angel's departure in the flame underscores the supernatural nature of the encounter and the divine approval of the message delivered to Manoah and his wife.<p><b>When Manoah and his wife saw this</b><br>The witnessing of this event by Manoah and his wife emphasizes the reality and tangibility of the divine encounter. Their ability to see the angel ascend in the flame confirms the authenticity of the message and the divine nature of the visitor. This moment of revelation is crucial, as it validates the promise of Samson's birth and his future role as a deliverer of Israel. The couple's experience is similar to other biblical figures who encountered divine messengers, such as Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 18) and Zechariah and Elizabeth (Luke 1).<p><b>they fell facedown to the ground</b><br>Falling facedown is a common biblical response to divine presence, indicating reverence, awe, and submission. This act of worship reflects the recognition of God's holiness and the human acknowledgment of their own unworthiness. Similar responses are seen throughout scripture, such as in the visions of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>) and John (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). This posture of humility and worship is a fitting response to the divine revelation and the miraculous sign they have just witnessed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Dan, husband to the barren woman who would become Samson's mother.

This points forward to the incarnate Christ, who would later ascend to heaven after completing His redemptive work (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>).<p>- The angel&#8217;s exit within the flame underlines that what Manoah saw was no mere man; it validates every promise given about Samson and reaffirms that &#8220;with God nothing will be impossible&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell facedown to the ground</b><p>&#8220; &#8216;When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell facedown to the ground.&#8217; &#8221;<p>- Overwhelmed by the manifestation of God&#8217;s glory, they respond as Joshua did before the Commander of the LORD&#8217;s army (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>) and as Ezekiel did at the vision of the throne (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>).<p>- Falling prostrate conveys reverence, awe, and submission; it is the natural human reaction whenever the divine breaks through visibly (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p>- Their posture also marks the moment as a turning point: the couple who once doubted now worship in faith, fully assured that the child to be born belongs to God&#8217;s larger salvation plan (<a href="/judges/13-24.htm">Judges 13:24&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p>The rising flame shows God&#8217;s acceptance of a literal sacrifice; the Angel&#8217;s ascent in that flame reveals His divine identity and faithfulness; the couple&#8217;s immediate prostration models the only fitting human response&#8212;humble, awestruck worship of the living God who still acts, still speaks, and always keeps His promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">From off the altar.</span>--The rock (<span class= "ital">tsor</span>) of <a href="/judges/13-19.htm" title="So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it on a rock to the LORD: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.">Judges 13:19</a> is now hallowed into an altar (<span class= "ital">mizbeach</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Fell on their faces.</span>--Comp. <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm" title="And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-5.htm" title="Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.">Numbers 14:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm" title="As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.
