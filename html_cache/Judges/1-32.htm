The land allotted to Asher was in the northern part of Canaan, a region known for its fertile plains and access to the Mediterranean Sea. The Canaanites were the original inhabitants of the land, known for their polytheistic religion and practices that were contrary to the worship of Yahweh. The presence of the Asherites among the Canaanites indicates a failure to fully possess the land as commanded by God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This coexistence often led to the Israelites adopting Canaanite customs and idolatry, which was a recurring issue throughout the Book of Judges.<p><b>because they did not drive them out</b><br>The command to drive out the inhabitants of Canaan was given to the Israelites to prevent the influence of pagan practices and to establish a nation devoted to God (<a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31-33</a>). The failure of the Asherites to drive out the Canaanites reflects a lack of faith and obedience, which had significant spiritual and social consequences. This disobedience is a theme throughout Judges, illustrating the cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. The inability to fully conquer the land foreshadows the struggles Israel would face, as the Canaanites became a source of temptation and conflict. This situation also highlights the importance of complete obedience to God's commands and the dangers of compromise with the surrounding culture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherites.htm">Asherites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descendants of Asher, one of Jacob's sons.

God&#8217;s expectation was full possession, just as He promised Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a> and reaffirmed through Moses in <a href="/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50-53</a>.<p>- The phrase &#8220;So &#8230; lived&#8221; links Asher&#8217;s story to the earlier reports of half-hearted occupations by Manasseh, Ephraim, Zebulun, and others (<a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27-31</a>). A pattern of compromise is hardening.<p>- Living implies settling down, building homes, and building habits; it is more than camping. The tribe accepted the status quo instead of pressing forward in faith as Joshua had urged: &#8220;Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people possession of the land&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land</b><p>- Instead of the Canaanites dwelling &#8220;in their midst,&#8221; Scripture says the Asherites dwelt &#8220;among&#8221; the Canaanites, flipping the order God intended (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-4</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32-33</a>).<p>- Coexistence opened the door to idolatry. <a href="/judges/3-5.htm">Judges 3:5-6</a> records the eventual result for other tribes: &#8220;The Israelites took their daughters in marriage&#8230; and served their gods.&#8221;<p>- The New Testament echoes the danger of unequally shared space: &#8220;Do not be yoked together with unbelievers&#8230; &#8216;Therefore come out from among them and be separate,&#8217; says the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-17</a>).<p>- What should have been a holy influence on the land became a worldly influence on God&#8217;s people (<a href="/psalms/106-34.htm">Psalm 106:34-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because they did not drive them out</b><p>- God&#8217;s command was crystal clear: &#8220;You must drive out the inhabitants of the land before you&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>). Partial obedience is disobedience.<p>- Reasons often given&#8212;Canaanite iron chariots (<a href="/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>), fortified cities, or economic convenience&#8212;could never outweigh God&#8217;s promise of victory (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1-4</a>).<p>- The Angel of the LORD later confronts Israel: &#8220;I said, &#8216;I will never break My covenant with you&#8230; but you have not obeyed My voice&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-2</a>). Consequences followed: persistent idolatry, oppression, and loss of distinct witness.<p>- Failure to drive out sin&#8217;s influence in our own hearts operates the same way (<a href="/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12-13</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5-10</a>). What we tolerate today can dominate tomorrow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/1-32.htm">Judges 1:32</a> records more than a historical footnote; it exposes the cost of compromise. Asher settled down where God had called them to conquer, lived under Canaanite influence instead of ruling in covenant blessing, and suffered because they chose convenience over obedience. The verse challenges every believer to complete the task God gives, remove what He says to remove, and trust that His promises are always enough.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) The Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites.--The change of phrase from <a href="/judges/1-30.htm" title="Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelled among them, and became tributaries.">Judges 1:30</a> implies that in these districts the Canaanites had the upper hand.
