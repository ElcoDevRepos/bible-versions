His role as a judge is briefly mentioned, highlighting the cyclical nature of Israel's leadership during the time of the Judges. The mention of his father, Hillel, suggests a lineage of some prominence, though little else is known about them. The brevity of Abdon's account reflects the period's instability and the frequent changes in leadership. His death marks the end of his judgeship, a common pattern in the Book of Judges where each judge's death often leads to a period of unrest or transition.<p><b>and he was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim</b><br>Pirathon is identified as Abdon's hometown, located in the tribal territory of Ephraim. Ephraim was one of the prominent tribes of Israel, often playing a significant role in the nation's history. The burial in one's hometown was a common practice, signifying a return to one's roots and family heritage. This also emphasizes the importance of tribal and familial connections in ancient Israelite society. The location in Ephraim may also indicate the influence and reach of Abdon's leadership within this central region of Israel.<p><b>in the hill country of the Amalekites</b><br>The mention of the Amalekites, a perennial enemy of Israel, provides historical context. The hill country of the Amalekites suggests a region that was once under their control or influence, highlighting the ongoing struggle between Israel and surrounding nations. This area, now part of Israelite territory, signifies the gradual conquest and settlement of the Promised Land, fulfilling God's promises to the patriarchs. The presence of the Amalekites in the narrative serves as a reminder of the spiritual and physical battles Israel faced, often seen as a type of the Christian's spiritual warfare against sin and opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abdon.htm">Abdon</a></b><br>Abdon was a judge of Israel, the son of Hillel.
