The event described in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>, involving the brutal abuse and death of a concubine, was so appalling that it elicited a unanimous response from the people. This reflects the deep moral and social decay present in Israel during the time of the Judges, a period characterized by the repeated cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance.<p><b>&#8220;Nothing like this has been seen or done</b><br>The phrase underscores the unprecedented nature of the crime. It highlights the severity of the moral decline in Israel, where such an atrocity was unimaginable. This serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of Israel's failure to fully obey God's commands and drive out the Canaanite influences, which led to the adoption of pagan practices and a departure from God's law.<p><b>from the day the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This reference to the Exodus serves as a historical marker, reminding the Israelites of their covenant relationship with God, which began with their deliverance from Egypt. It contrasts the current state of moral decay with the time when God established them as His chosen people, intended to be a holy nation. The mention of Egypt also serves as a reminder of God's past faithfulness and the standards He set for His people.<p><b>until this day.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the ongoing nature of the moral decline, suggesting that the situation had deteriorated progressively since the time of the Exodus. It serves as a call to reflection on how far the nation had strayed from its original calling and covenant with God.<p><b>Think it over,</b><br>This is an invitation to contemplation and self-examination. The Israelites are urged to consider the gravity of the situation and the underlying causes of such moral decay. It is a call to introspection, encouraging the people to reflect on their personal and collective responsibility in allowing such evil to occur.<p><b>take counsel,</b><br>This phrase suggests the need for collective deliberation and decision-making. It implies that the situation requires a thoughtful and unified response from the community. In the context of Israel, this would involve seeking God's guidance and wisdom, as well as consulting the leaders and elders to determine the appropriate course of action.<p><b>and speak up!&#8221;</b><br>The call to speak up is an exhortation to action. It emphasizes the necessity of addressing the issue openly and decisively. In the biblical context, this would involve confronting sin, seeking justice, and restoring righteousness within the community. It is a reminder of the responsibility of God's people to uphold His standards and to be a voice for truth and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in the account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine.
