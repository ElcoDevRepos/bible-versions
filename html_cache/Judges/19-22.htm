Hospitality was a sacred duty, and sharing a meal was a sign of peace and friendship. The setting is reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where Lot entertains angels in Sodom, highlighting the contrast between the host's intentions and the impending wickedness.<p><b>suddenly the wicked men of the city surrounded the house</b><br>The suddenness underscores the unexpected nature of evil, often catching people off guard. The "wicked men" are described similarly to the men of Sodom, suggesting a pervasive moral decay in Israel during the time of the Judges, a period marked by the repeated cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. This reflects the theme of Israel's need for a righteous king, as noted in <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>.<p><b>Pounding on the door</b><br>This aggressive action signifies the urgency and violence of the men's intentions. Doors in biblical times were often simple wooden structures, easily breached, symbolizing the vulnerability of the household. The act of pounding also echoes the persistent nature of sin, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>, where sin is described as crouching at the door.<p><b>they said to the old man who owned the house</b><br>The old man represents the head of the household, responsible for the protection and well-being of his guests. His role is crucial in the narrative, as he is expected to uphold the cultural and moral duty of hospitality. This mirrors the responsibility of leaders in Israel to protect and guide their people, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Bring out the man who came to your house</b><br>This demand is a direct violation of the sacred duty of hospitality, which required the host to protect his guests at all costs. The request echoes the depravity of Sodom in <a href="/genesis/19-5.htm">Genesis 19:5</a>, illustrating the moral decline in Israel. It serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God's laws.<p><b>so we can have relations with him!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase reveals the intent of sexual violence, a grievous sin in the eyes of God. This act of intended homosexual rape is condemned in <a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a> and <a href="/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26-27</a>, highlighting the severity of the sin. The narrative foreshadows the need for a savior, as the moral corruption of humanity necessitates divine intervention, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine.

A peaceful meal is shattered by a lawless mob intent on sexual assault, exposing societal rot when God&#8217;s Word is ignored. Each phrase marks escalating rebellion&#8212;from enjoying fellowship, to surrounding, to pounding, to demanding, to plotting gross sin. The verse warns that whenever a community abandons God&#8217;s authority, violence and immorality inevitably follow, urging believers to uphold righteousness, protect the vulnerable, and honor covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Sons of Belial.</span>--It is only by a deeply-rooted misconception that Belial is written with a capital. The word is not the name (as is supposed) of an evil spirit, but an ordinary noun, "sons of worthlessness," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"worthless fellows." (See <a href="/deuteronomy/13-14.htm" title="Then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is worked among you;">Deuteronomy 13:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-5.htm" title="The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.">Psalm 18:5</a>.) Later (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?">2Corinthians 6:15</a>) it became a kind of proper name. Josephus dishonestly suppresses all the darkest features of the story (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 11, ? 7).<p><span class= "bld">Beset the house.</span>--There is a close resemblance to the equally hideous narrative of <a href="/genesis/19-8.htm" title="Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do you to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.">Genesis 19:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Beat at the door.</span>--The word implies continuous knocking and gradual increase of noise (<a href="/songs/5-2.htm" title="I sleep, but my heart wakes: it is the voice of my beloved that knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.">Song of Solomon 5:2</a>). We cannot wonder that the intense horror excited by this scene of infamy lasted for centuries afterwards. "They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah" (<a href="/hosea/9-9.htm" title="They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.">Hosea 9:9</a>). "O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah" (<a href="/hosea/10-9.htm" title="O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.">Hosea 10:9</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Making their hearts merry</span> - as in vers. 6, 9, and in <a href="/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>; <a href="/ruth/3-7.htm">Ruth 3:7</a>. But there is nothing in the expression implying any excess in drinking. <span class="cmt_word">Bring forth the man</span>. The abandoned character of the men appears in this, that not only did they offer no hospitality to the stranger themselves, but were ready to violate the sanctity of the hospitality of the old man's house by their brutal violence. There must have been a fearful absence of all law and order and government when such deeds could be done without any interference on the part of magistrate or elder or ruler of any kind. The singular resemblance of the whole narrative to that in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. suggests that the Israelites by their contact with the accursed Canaanites had reduced themselves to the level of Sodom and Gomorrah. Surely this shows the wisdom of the command to destroy utterly the workers of abomination. <span class="cmt_word">Sons of Belial</span>.
