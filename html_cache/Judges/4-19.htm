His request for water highlights his vulnerability and desperation. In the ancient Near East, offering water to a guest was a common act of hospitality, reflecting cultural norms of kindness to strangers. This request also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's deliverance through unexpected means, as Sisera seeks refuge in the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. The Kenites were a nomadic tribe with connections to Israel, yet they maintained peace with the Canaanites, making Sisera's choice seem strategically safe.<p><b>So she opened a container of milk,</b><br>Jael's choice to offer milk instead of water is significant. Milk, often seen as a luxury compared to water, could indicate a gesture of greater hospitality or an intention to lull Sisera into a false sense of security. In the cultural context, milk might have been seen as a soothing and nourishing drink, possibly leading to drowsiness. This act of giving milk instead of water can be seen as a strategic move by Jael, aligning with God's plan to deliver Israel through unconventional means.<p><b>gave him a drink,</b><br>Jael's action of giving Sisera a drink fulfills his request but also serves a deeper purpose. In biblical narratives, the act of giving a drink can symbolize care and provision, yet here it foreshadows Sisera's downfall. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical instances where a seemingly benign act leads to significant consequences, such as when Rebekah gave water to Abraham's servant, leading to her becoming Isaac's wife. The act of giving a drink can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offers living water to those who are spiritually thirsty.<p><b>and covered him again.</b><br>By covering Sisera, Jael provides him with a sense of safety and rest, which ultimately leads to his demise. This act of covering can be seen as a deceptive kindness, as it lulls Sisera into a false sense of security. In the broader biblical narrative, covering often symbolizes protection or concealment, yet here it is part of God's plan to deliver Israel. This moment foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people over their enemies, as seen in the final victory of Christ over sin and death. The covering also connects to themes of refuge and betrayal, as Sisera's trust in Jael leads to his unexpected end.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>The commander of the Canaanite army under King Jabin, who fled to the tent of Jael after being defeated by the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jael.htm">Jael</a></b><br>The wife of Heber the Kenite, who played a crucial role in the defeat of Sisera by offering him hospitality and then killing him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heber_the_kenite.htm">Heber the Kenite</a></b><br>Jael's husband, who was allied with King Jabin of Canaan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent.htm">The Tent</a></b><br>The setting where Jael offered Sisera milk instead of water, leading to his eventual demise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Sisera's request for water and Jael's offering of milk, which is a pivotal moment leading to his death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_godly_courage.htm">The Power of Godly Courage</a></b><br>Jael's actions demonstrate the courage to act decisively in alignment with God's purposes, even when it involves personal risk.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br>The account illustrates how God can use unexpected people and means to accomplish His will, reminding us to be open to His leading.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hospitality_and_deception.htm">Hospitality and Deception</a></b><br>While hospitality is a virtue, Jael's account shows that discernment is necessary, as not all hospitality is genuine.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_women_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Women in God's Plan</a></b><br>Jael's significant role in the defeat of Sisera highlights the importance of women in God's redemptive history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The account serves as a metaphor for spiritual vigilance, reminding believers to be alert and prepared for spiritual battles.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_4_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 4:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_4_19_Hospitality_s_role.htm">How does Judges 4:19 illustrate the importance of hospitality in Christian life?

Sisera&#8217;s dry mouth foreshadows the emptiness of opposing the Lord&#8217;s people (<a href="/psalms/34-21.htm">Psalm 34:21</a>).<p>&#8211; The verse reminds readers that God &#8220;drains the spirit of princes&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;So she opened a container of milk&#8221;</b><p>&#8211; Jael offers more than requested, paralleling the kindness Rebekah showed to Abraham&#8217;s servant (<a href="/genesis/24-18.htm">Genesis 24:18-20</a>), yet here the act masks a deadly intent (<a href="/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a>).<p>&#8211; Milk rather than water suggests comfort, hospitality, even luxury (Song of Songs 5:1; <a href="/proverbs/30-33.htm">Proverbs 30:33</a>).<p>&#8211; Warm milk can induce drowsiness; God is turning Sisera&#8217;s own need into the means of his defeat, similar to Gideon&#8217;s jars and torches later in <a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16-22</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;gave him a drink&#8221;</b><p>&#8211; Jael&#8217;s service fulfills <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a>, &#8220;If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,&#8221; but the outcome will be vastly different from Paul&#8217;s citation in <a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>.<p>&#8211; Her action appears merciful, yet God will use it to crush the oppressor (<a href="/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>).<p>&#8211; The scene showcases divine irony: Sisera&#8217;s last moment of comfort comes from the very people he oppressed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and covered him again&#8221;</b><p>&#8211; Jael&#8217;s covering blanket serves two purposes: hiding him from pursuers and lulling him into deeper security (<a href="/judges/4-18.htm">Judges 4:18</a>).<p>&#8211; Covering symbolically prepares a body for death (<a href="/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9-10</a>; <a href="/luke/23-53.htm">Luke 23:53</a>).<p>&#8211; The repetition&#8212;she covered him once, now again&#8212;emphasizes how thoroughly God has hemmed Sisera in (<a href="/psalms/139-5.htm">Psalm 139:5</a>).<p>&#8211; While Sisera feels safe, heaven&#8217;s verdict is already sealed, recalling <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>, yet applied in reverse: the enemy shelters under a human roof but not under God&#8217;s wings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Each phrase in <a href="/judges/4-19.htm">Judges 4:19</a> traces Sisera&#8217;s swift descent from proud commander to helpless fugitive: his request (&#8220;a little water&#8221;) exposes need; Jael&#8217;s unexpected milk deepens his false security; her blanket conceals him for the final blow. The verse celebrates God&#8217;s sovereignty in turning ordinary hospitality into the setting for victory, proving again that &#8220;the LORD saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Give me, I pray thee, a little water.</span>--The request was natural enough; but, as he had not made it at first, we may suspect that he wanted to taste food in the tent, as a way of rendering still more secure the inviolable laws of Eastern hospitality. Saladin refuses to let Reginald of Chatillon drink in his tent, because he means to kill him.<p><span class= "bld">A bottle of milk.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the skin of milk. </span>The word "bottle" means, of course, a leathern bottle or skin. Josephus says that the milk was "already corrupted," i.e., that it was butter-milk (<span class= "ital">Antt </span>v. 6, ? 5). This is quite probable, because butter-milk (<span class= "ital">lebban</span>) is a common drink in Arab tents. When R. Tanchum adds that butter-milk inebriates, and Rashi that it produces deep sleep, and that it was her object to stupefy him, they are simply giving reins to their imagination. Josephus says, <span class= "ital">"</span>He drank so immoderately that he fell asleep." It might have been supposed that she would naturally offer him <span class= "ital">wine; </span>but it is far from certain that even "must" or "unfermented wine"--much less fermented wine, which requires considerable art to make--would have been found in those poor tents; and, further, these Kenites may have been abstainers from wine, as their descendants the Rechabites were.
