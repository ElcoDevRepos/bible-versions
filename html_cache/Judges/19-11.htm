At this time, it was inhabited by the Jebusites, a Canaanite tribe. The Israelites had not yet fully conquered the land, as seen in <a href="/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>, where the Jebusites continued to dwell in Jerusalem. This highlights the incomplete obedience of Israel in driving out the inhabitants of the land as commanded by God.<p><b>and the day was almost gone</b><br>Traveling in ancient times was fraught with danger, especially as night approached. The lack of artificial lighting and the presence of bandits made it perilous to continue traveling after dark. This urgency underscores the need for a safe place to rest, reflecting the harsh realities of travel in the ancient Near East.<p><b>the servant said to his master</b><br>The servant's role here is significant, as servants often provided counsel and assistance to their masters. This interaction shows a level of respect and consideration between the servant and his master, which is consistent with the biblical principle of treating others with dignity, as seen in <a href="/colossians/4.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Please, let us stop at this Jebusite city</b><br>The suggestion to stop at a Jebusite city indicates a pragmatic approach to travel, prioritizing safety over cultural or religious differences. The Jebusites were not Israelites, and stopping in their city could pose risks, yet the servant's concern for immediate safety takes precedence. This reflects the tension between practical needs and spiritual convictions, a theme seen throughout Scripture.<p><b>and spend the night here.&#8221;</b><br>Spending the night in a foreign city would require trust in God's protection, as seen in <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>, which speaks of dwelling in safety through God's provision. This decision also foreshadows the events that follow, highlighting the moral and spiritual decline in Israel during the time of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine and servant.
