Samson, a Nazirite from birth, was chosen by God to begin delivering Israel from Philistine control. The Philistines' observation of Samson indicates their awareness of his presence and potential threat. This moment foreshadows the tension between Samson and the Philistines, which is a recurring theme in his narrative.<p><b>they selected thirty men to accompany him</b><br>The selection of thirty men suggests a measure of both honor and surveillance. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, it was customary to provide companions or attendants for guests, especially during wedding feasts. However, the number thirty may also imply a precautionary measure, as Samson's reputation for strength and unpredictability was likely known. This group could serve as both witnesses to the marriage and as a means to keep an eye on Samson, ensuring he did not cause trouble. This act sets the stage for the riddle challenge that follows, which becomes a pivotal moment in the conflict between Samson and the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, given by God to deliver Israel from the Philistines.

Ostensibly friendly, the entourage serves as security, social formality, and surveillance. Their presence exposes the mutual distrust between Samson and the Philistines and sets the stage for the riddle, deceit, and violence that follow. Through this small detail, Scripture shows God steering events to confront Israel&#8217;s oppressors, while warning believers of the cost of compromise and the certainty of divine purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">When they saw him.</span>--The reason why this clause is added is somewhat obscure, and this is perhaps the reason why the LXX. and Josephus, without any warrant, render it "when they were afraid of him, which would involve a change in the reading.<p><span class= "bld">They brought thirty companions.</span>--It was necessary to the splendour of the marriage feast that there should be these paranymphs (<span class= "ital">shoshbenim, </span>or "children of the bride-chamber," <a href="/matthew/9-15.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.">Matthew 9:15</a>).

We still see a strong resemblance to the wedding arrangements referred to in <a href="/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>, and Matthew 25:1-12; only in this case they were young men instead of young women who went out to meet the bridegroom. We may observe, by the way, that the scale of the wedding feast, as regards numbers and duration, indicates that Samson s family was one of wealth and position. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/14-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the Philistines] saw him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(kir&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they selected</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">thirty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7970.htm">Strong's 7970: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thirty, thirtieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men to accompany him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1469;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4828.htm">Strong's 4828: </a> </span><span class="str2">Friend, companion</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/14-11.htm">OT History: Judges 14:11 It happened when they saw him that (Jd Judg.
