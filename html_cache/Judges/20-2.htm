The leaders, or "chiefs," represent the tribal heads and elders who were responsible for making decisions and guiding the people. This gathering signifies a national crisis, as the tribes come together to address the grievous sin committed in Gibeah. The unity here contrasts with the frequent disunity seen throughout the Book of Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). This assembly is reminiscent of earlier gatherings, such as those under Moses and Joshua, where the tribes united for a common purpose.<p><b>presented themselves in the assembly of God&#8217;s people</b><br>The assembly of God's people refers to a formal gathering, often for religious or judicial purposes. This assembly is convened at Mizpah (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>), a significant location for Israelite gatherings and covenant renewals. The phrase underscores the theocratic nature of Israel, where God is the ultimate authority, and the people are His covenant community. This assembly is not merely a political or military council but a gathering under divine oversight, seeking to address sin and injustice in accordance with God's law.<p><b>400,000 men on foot, armed with swords</b><br>The mention of 400,000 men indicates a substantial military force, reflecting the seriousness of the situation. This number suggests a full mobilization of Israel's fighting men, emphasizing the gravity of the offense and the need for decisive action. The men being "on foot" and "armed with swords" highlights their readiness for battle, prepared to execute judgment on the tribe of Benjamin for harboring the perpetrators of the crime in Gibeah. This military assembly is reminiscent of earlier battles in Israel's history, such as those led by Joshua, where the Israelites fought to uphold God's commands and maintain the holiness of the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_of_israel.htm">Leaders of Israel</a></b><br>These are the heads or chiefs of the tribes of Israel, responsible for guiding and making decisions for their people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribes_of_israel.htm">Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The twelve tribes descended from the sons of Jacob, representing the nation of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assembly_of_god's_people.htm">Assembly of God&#8217;s People</a></b><br>A gathering of the Israelites, often for decision-making, worship, or addressing significant issues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_hundred_thousand_men.htm">Four Hundred Thousand Men</a></b><br>A large military force assembled from the tribes, indicating the seriousness of the situation they were addressing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/armed_with_swords.htm">Armed with Swords</a></b><br>This detail highlights the readiness for battle, suggesting a grave conflict or threat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_crisis.htm">Unity in Crisis</a></b><br>The gathering of all tribes signifies the importance of unity among God&#8217;s people, especially in times of crisis.

The enumeration in the wilderness gave 603,550 (<a href="/numbers/2-32.htm">Numbers 2:32</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21</a>), and at the second numbering 601,730 (<a href="/numbers/26-51.htm">Numbers 26:51</a>). In <a href="/1_samuel/11-8.htm">1 Samuel 11:8</a> a general assembly of the whole people, summoned by sending a piece of the flesh of a yoke of oxen "throughout all the coasts of Israel," amounted to 330,000. David's numbering gave of Israel 800,000, and of Judah 500,000, in all 1,300,000; but these were not assembled together, but numbered at their own homes. Jehoshaphat's men of war amounted to 1,160,000 according to <a href="/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-18</a>. In the time of Amaziah there were of Judah alone 300,000 men able to go forth to war (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-6.htm">2 Chronicles 24:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The leaders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(pin&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6438.htm">Strong's 6438: </a> </span><span class="str2">An angle, a pinnacle, a chieftain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
