His actions reflect the spiritual confusion and idolatry prevalent in Israel during the time of the Judges, a period marked by the absence of centralized leadership and widespread moral decay (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). Micah's statement reveals his personal beliefs and the syncretism that had infiltrated Israelite worship.<p><b>&#8220;Now I know that the LORD will be good to me</b><br>Micah's confidence in receiving the LORD's favor is based on his own understanding and manipulation of religious practices. This reflects a common misconception that God's blessings can be earned through human actions or arrangements, rather than through obedience and faithfulness to His covenant. This attitude contrasts with the biblical teaching that God's favor is not transactional but relational, rooted in His grace and the covenant relationship with His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p><b>because a Levite has become my priest.&#8221;</b><br>The Levite's role as a priest in Micah's household is significant. Levites were set apart for religious duties, but only descendants of Aaron were to serve as priests (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). Micah's installation of a Levite as his personal priest indicates a departure from the prescribed order of worship. This act of appointing a Levite outside the established priestly line highlights the disorder and disregard for God's commandments during this era. It also foreshadows the later establishment of unauthorized worship centers in Israel, such as those set up by Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>). This situation underscores the need for a faithful priesthood, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our High Priest, who mediates a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A man from the hill country of Ephraim who creates a shrine and appoints his own son as a priest before hiring a Levite.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite.htm">Levite</a></b><br>A young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the tribe of Levi, who becomes a priest for Micah, despite the irregularity of the situation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>A region in Israel where Micah resides, known for its central location and significance in Israelite history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem_in_judah.htm">Bethlehem in Judah</a></b><br>The Levite's original home, a town with significant biblical history, including being the birthplace of King David and later Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shrine.htm">The Shrine</a></b><br>A place of worship created by Micah, which includes an idol and household gods, contrary to the commandments given to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/misplaced_confidence.htm">Misplaced Confidence</a></b><br>Micah's belief that having a Levite as a priest guarantees God's favor reflects a misunderstanding of true worship and obedience.

He substitutes authentic obedience with a DIY religion, thinking a legitimate priestly badge can sanctify idolatry. Scripture warns that true goodness from the LORD flows from loving, covenant faithfulness, not human shortcuts. The verse therefore stands as a caution: align worship fully with God&#8217;s revealed will, for only then can we rightly expect His favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">That the Lord will do me good.</span>--In this anticipation we find a very little further on that he was rudely undeceived, and we are hardly in a position to know whether it was due to hypocrisy or to mere ignorance. So far as Micah was devout and sincere, we must feel that the Lord did him good by stripping him of his gorgeous instruments of superstition and humbling his pride.<p><span class= "bld">I have a Levite to my priest.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the Levite. </span>The article may be generic, meaning "one of the Levites;" but Jonathan, as a son of Gershom, has a special right to be called "<span class= "ital">the </span>Levite," as a representative of the tribe. It is at least doubtful whether the priestly functions expected of him in this instance included sacrifice; but, in any case, Micah could hardly have been entirely unaware that the Levites were incapable of priestly functions ("Seek ye the <span class= "ital">priesthood </span>also?"--<a href="/numbers/16-10.htm" title="And he has brought you near to him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you: and seek you the priesthood also?">Numbers 16:10</a>), or of the fact that the authorised worship of the nation was to be confined to the place which God should choose, which in this instance was Shiloh. In any case, however, the passage furnishes us with a fresh proof of the utter neglect of the Mosaic law, as represented in the Book of Leviticus, from a very early period. His "house of God" seems to have resembled the high places, which even the faithful kings of Israel were unable or unwilling to clear away. They were ultimately cleared away by Hezekiah, but not without so great a shock to the then established custom, that Rabshakeh actually appeals to the fact in proof of Hezekiah's impiety, and as a sign that he has forfeited the favour of Jehovah (<a href="/2_kings/18-22.htm" title="But if you say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?">2Kings 18:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said Micah</span>, etc. We may notice this incidental proof that the Levites in the time of Micah held the religious position which is ascribed to them in the Pentateuch. <span class="cmt_word">I have a Levite</span>.
