The context is a negotiation between Samson and his fellow Israelites, who are under Philistine oppression. The Israelites are attempting to avoid further conflict with the Philistines by handing Samson over. This reflects the Israelites' fear and subjugation under Philistine rule, highlighting their lack of faith in God's deliverance through Samson.<p><b>&#8220;we will not kill you,</b><br>The men of Judah assure Samson that they will not harm him themselves. This promise indicates a level of respect or fear for Samson, acknowledging his role as a judge and deliverer of Israel. It also reflects the cultural and legal norms of the time, where blood vengeance and familial ties were significant, and killing a fellow Israelite could lead to internal conflict.<p><b>but we will tie you up securely</b><br>The act of tying Samson securely suggests a desire to ensure he cannot escape or cause harm. This reflects the Israelites' pragmatic approach to dealing with the Philistines, prioritizing their immediate safety over trust in Samson's divine mission. The use of ropes also symbolizes the Israelites' spiritual bondage and lack of faith, as they rely on human means rather than divine intervention.<p><b>and hand you over to them.&#8221;</b><br>The intention to hand Samson over to the Philistines shows the Israelites' desperation to appease their oppressors. This act of betrayal is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's chosen leaders face rejection by their own people, such as Joseph being sold by his brothers or Jesus being handed over by Judas. It underscores the recurring theme of God's deliverers being misunderstood and rejected.<p><b>So they bound him with two new ropes</b><br>The use of "two new ropes" emphasizes the Israelites' determination to ensure Samson's captivity. New ropes would be stronger and less likely to break, indicating their fear of his strength. This detail foreshadows the miraculous nature of Samson's eventual escape, as it highlights the futility of human efforts against God's power. The binding of Samson can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was bound and led to crucifixion, yet ultimately triumphed over death.<p><b>and led him up from the rock.</b><br>The phrase "led him up from the rock" suggests a geographical movement from a place of refuge or hiding. The rock may symbolize a place of strength or divine protection, as rocks often do in biblical literature. This movement away from the rock can be seen as a departure from God's protection due to the Israelites' lack of faith. It also sets the stage for God's power to be displayed through Samson's subsequent actions, reinforcing the theme of deliverance despite human failure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.
