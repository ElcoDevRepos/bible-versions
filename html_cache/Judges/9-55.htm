Abimelech, the son of Gideon, had seized power by killing his seventy brothers, except for Jotham, who escaped. His death signifies the end of his tyrannical rule. The Israelites' reaction to his death reflects the instability and lack of centralized leadership during the period of the Judges. This era was marked by a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance, as described throughout the Book of Judges. Abimelech's death can be seen as divine retribution for his murderous actions, fulfilling Jotham's curse (<a href="/judges/9-20.htm">Judges 9:20</a>).<p><b>they all went home</b><br>The Israelites' return to their homes indicates a temporary cessation of conflict and a return to normalcy. This dispersal highlights the decentralized nature of Israelite society at the time, where tribal and familial ties were stronger than national unity. The phrase suggests a lack of collective mourning or loyalty to Abimelech, underscoring his failure to establish a legitimate or respected kingship. This return home also reflects the broader theme in Judges of the Israelites' repeated failure to maintain faithfulness to God, leading to cycles of oppression and deliverance. The absence of a strong, godly leader often resulted in chaos and moral decline, setting the stage for the eventual demand for a monarchy in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), who declared himself king over Shechem and surrounding areas.

Much like the Israelites &#8220;saw&#8221; the bodies of the Egyptians on the seashore after the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>), their sight now confirms God&#8217;s judgment on an oppressor.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/bsb/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>, God had already promised retribution against Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem (<a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23-24</a>). Seeing his demise verifies the fulfillment of that word, bolstering confidence in divine justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Abimelech was dead</b><p>&#8226; Abimelech&#8217;s death ends a brutal, self-appointed reign (<a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1-6</a>). His downfall by a millstone dropped by an unnamed woman (<a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53-54</a>) mirrors the principle that pride leads to destruction (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative emphasizes that human schemes cannot outmaneuver God&#8217;s sovereignty. Just as Sisera fell by the hand of Jael (<a href="/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21-22</a>), Abimelech&#8217;s death through an unexpected agent showcases God&#8217;s pattern of using the humble to topple the mighty.<p>&#8226; Cross references reinforce this theme: <a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a> declares, &#8220;It is God who judges: He brings one down, He exalts another,&#8221; while <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a> notes that God &#8220;removes kings and sets up kings.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they all went home</b><p>&#8226; The text concludes with a swift dispersal. Once the tyrant is gone, Israel&#8217;s factions no longer see cause to fight. The cessation of conflict recalls <a href="/2_samuel/18-17.htm">2 Samuel 18:17</a>, where, after Absalom&#8217;s death, the troops also &#8220;went to their tents.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Home&#8221; represents normalcy restored. Throughout the period of the Judges, peace returns only when oppression is removed (<a href="/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11</a>; 5:31; 8:28).<p>&#8226; This ending exposes the fragility of alliances built on fear. Abimelech&#8217;s forces crumble without his leadership, echoing <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>&#8212;strike the shepherd, and the sheep scatter.<p>&#8226; For the reader, the verse cautions against rallying around ungodly power: any unity founded on sin dissolves once God&#8217;s righteous judgment intervenes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-55.htm">Judges 9:55</a> captures the dramatic climax of Abimelech&#8217;s downfall: the people see, realize God&#8217;s judgment, and quietly return to everyday life. The verse affirms that God vindicates righteousness, topples wicked leaders, and restores peace, reminding believers that true security is found not in human rulers but in faithful obedience to the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(55) <span class= "bld">They departed.</span>--The death of a leader was generally sufficient to break up an ancient army (<a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm" title="Therefore David ran, and stood on the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith.
