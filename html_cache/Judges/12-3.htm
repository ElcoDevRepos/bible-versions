Jephthah, the speaker, acknowledges the lack of support from his fellow Israelites, specifically the Ephraimites. This highlights the recurring theme in Judges of Israel's disunity and internal strife. The context is set during a time when tribal alliances were fragile, and leaders often acted independently. This phrase also underscores the human tendency to rely on others for deliverance, contrasting with the biblical emphasis on divine intervention.<p><b>I risked my life and crossed over to the Ammonites</b><br>Jephthah's decision to confront the Ammonites alone demonstrates his courage and leadership. The phrase "risked my life" indicates the personal danger and sacrifice involved. Geographically, the Ammonites were located east of the Jordan River, in present-day Jordan. This crossing signifies a bold move into enemy territory, reflecting the high stakes of ancient warfare. Historically, the Ammonites were frequent adversaries of Israel, and this conflict is part of a larger narrative of territorial disputes in the region.<p><b>and the LORD delivered them into my hand</b><br>This statement attributes the victory to divine intervention, a common theme in the Book of Judges. It emphasizes that despite human efforts, it is ultimately God who grants success. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God delivers His people when they are faithful. The phrase also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant, even when Israel is unfaithful. It echoes other instances in Scripture where God delivers His people, such as the Exodus from Egypt.<p><b>Why then have you come today to fight against me?</b><br>Jephthah's question reveals the tension and conflict within Israel. The Ephraimites' confrontation with Jephthah after his victory suggests jealousy and a desire for recognition. This internal conflict is a recurring issue in Judges, where tribal rivalries often undermine unity. The question also highlights the irony of Israelite infighting when external threats are present. It serves as a critique of the lack of solidarity among God's people, a theme that resonates throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and military prowess.
