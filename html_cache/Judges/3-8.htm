Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger is often a response to covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-18</a>). The Israelites had turned away from God, worshiping the Baals and Asherahs, which violated the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This divine anger is not arbitrary but a consistent response to sin, emphasizing God's holiness and justice.<p><b>and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim</b><br>The term "sold" suggests a relinquishing of protection, allowing Israel to fall under foreign domination as a consequence of their sin. Cushan-rishathaim, whose name means "Cushan of double wickedness," is a figure representing oppression and tyranny. This reflects the biblical theme of God using foreign nations as instruments of judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>). The selling into the hands of an enemy is a recurring motif in Judges, illustrating the cycle of sin, servitude, supplication, and salvation.<p><b>king of Aram-naharaim</b><br>Aram-naharaim, meaning "Aram of the two rivers," refers to the region of Mesopotamia, specifically between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This geographical reference highlights the extent of Israel's subjugation, as they were oppressed by a distant and powerful ruler. Historically, this area was known for its advanced civilization and military prowess, making Cushan-rishathaim a formidable adversary.<p><b>and the Israelites served him eight years</b><br>The period of eight years signifies a complete cycle of oppression, long enough for the Israelites to recognize their need for deliverance. In biblical numerology, the number eight often symbolizes new beginnings or a new order, suggesting that this period of servitude would eventually lead to repentance and renewal. This servitude is a direct consequence of Israel's disobedience, aligning with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>. The cycle of oppression and deliverance in Judges foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who breaks the bondage of sin and offers eternal freedom (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose anger is kindled against His people due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who have turned away from Him to serve other gods, leading to their oppression.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cushan-rishathaim.htm">Cushan-rishathaim</a></b><br>A king of Aram-naharaim, whose name means "Cushan of double wickedness," indicating his oppressive nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram-naharaim.htm">Aram-naharaim</a></b><br>A region in Mesopotamia, often associated with the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, highlighting the geographical reach of Israel's oppressors.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eight_years_of_servitude.htm">Eight Years of Servitude</a></b><br>The period during which Israel was subjected to the rule of Cushan-rishathaim, symbolizing a complete cycle of oppression due to their sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's anger is a response to Israel's idolatry and disobedience.

Israel had once again abandoned covenant faithfulness, choosing idols over the living God (<a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>). Scripture states plainly that the Lord is &#8220;a jealous and avenging God&#8221; who &#8220;is indignant every day&#8221; against sin (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s wrath is neither fickle nor arbitrary; it is a righteous response to willful rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16-22</a>; <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores divine holiness: the same God who lovingly redeemed Israel out of Egypt will not ignore unrepentant disobedience (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording the Lord&#8217;s anger, Scripture gives believers today a sober warning that grace never cancels holiness (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He sold them into the hand</b><p>&#8220;He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim&#8221; (<a href="/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8</a>).

The verse reminds believers that God&#8217;s sovereignty, justice, and mercy operate in harmonious balance, urging us to walk in wholehearted obedience today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim.</span>--If the reading of all the MSS. be correct, this must be a term of hatred rather than a name, for it means "Cushan of the double wickedness." Some MSS. of the LXX. have Chousarsathaim. Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 3, ? 3) shortens it into <span class= "ital">Chousarthes</span>; and St. Clemens of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom. i.</span> 21) into <span class= "ital">Chousachar. </span>Syncellus (<span class= "ital">Chronogr. </span>i. 58) says that Paphos was founded by those who fled from this Mesopotamian conqueror (Ewald). Cushan only occurs elsewhere in <a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm" title="I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.">Habakkuk 3:7</a>, "I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction." Cush was a son of Nimrod (<a href="/genesis/10-8.htm" title="And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.">Genesis 10:8</a>), and our translators, in the margin of <a href="/habakkuk/3-11.htm" title="The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of your arrows they went, and at the shining of your glittering spear.">Habakkuk 3:11</a>, render Cushan by Ethiopia. It is quite possible that Rishathaim may be the distorted form of the name of some town. It is always the tendency of a people to re-stamp a word which they receive into their current phraseology, because no nations like to use a term which they do not understand. Thus in our London streets, "Hangman's Gains" is a corruption of Hammes et Guynes, and Blind Chapel Court, of Blanch Appleton.<p>The Jews were not only accustomed thus to re-stamp (<span class= "ital">sur-frapper</span>) the names of foreign kings, peoples, and idols, but they especially rejoiced in using terms of hatred. Thus the Romans in the Talmud are called Idumeans; Beelzebul was changed into Beelzebub; Bethel into Bethaven; Ptolemy into Talmai; Ir-Cheres into Ir-Heres (see Note on <a href="/judges/1-33.htm" title="Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries to them.">Judges 1:33</a>), &c. In an ancient Rabbinic commentary the "<span class= "ital">two </span>wickednesses" are supposed to be those of Balaam and Cushan, or that of Laban repeating itself in his descendants. The Targum and Syriac render it "the criminal Cushan."<p><span class= "bld">King of Mesopotamia.</span>--In the original Aram-naharian, "the highland of the two rivers" (Euphratesand Tigris), or, as the LXX. render it, "Syria of the rivers."
