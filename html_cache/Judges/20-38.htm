The use of signals in warfare is a common practice in ancient military operations, indicating a level of organization and communication. This reflects the Israelites' reliance on human strategy in addition to divine guidance. The ambush tactic is reminiscent of the strategy used in the battle of Ai (Joshua 8), where God instructed Joshua to set an ambush against the city. This connection underscores the continuity of God's involvement in Israel's military endeavors.<p><b>When they sent up a great cloud of smoke from the city:</b><br>The signal of a great cloud of smoke serves as a visual cue for coordination during the battle. In ancient warfare, smoke was often used to communicate over long distances, especially in the absence of modern communication tools. The smoke rising from the city signifies the successful breach and burning of the city, a common practice in ancient conquests to demonstrate total victory and destruction. This imagery of smoke is also symbolic in biblical literature, often representing God's presence or judgment, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>). The use of smoke here can be seen as a type of divine judgment against the Benjamites for their grievous sin, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God using human agents to execute His justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, who are engaged in a civil war against the tribe of Benjamin due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_in_ambush.htm">The Men in Ambush</a></b><br>A group of Israelite soldiers strategically positioned to attack the city of Gibeah as part of a military tactic.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_of_gibeah.htm">The City of Gibeah</a></b><br>A Benjamite city where a heinous crime occurred, leading to the conflict between the tribe of Benjamin and the other Israelite tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_signal.htm">The Signal</a></b><br>A prearranged sign involving a great cloud of smoke, used to coordinate the attack and ensure the Israelites' victory over the Benjamites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_benjamin.htm">The Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, which is defending itself against the other tribes due to the actions of some of its members.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The events in <a href="/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a> are a direct result of the sin committed in Gibeah.
