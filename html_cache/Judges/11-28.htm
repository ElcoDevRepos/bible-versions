They were often in conflict with Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The king of the Ammonites during this time was seeking to reclaim land he believed was unjustly taken by Israel. This reflects the ongoing territorial disputes in the region, which were common due to the lack of defined borders and the nomadic nature of many tribes.<p><b>paid no heed</b><br>This phrase indicates a refusal to listen or consider the message sent by Jephthah. In the biblical narrative, this often signifies a hardened heart or a rejection of peaceful resolution, similar to Pharaoh's hardened heart in Exodus. It highlights the Ammonite king's determination to pursue war rather than diplomacy, which is a recurring theme in the conflicts between Israel and its neighbors.<p><b>to the message Jephthah sent him</b><br>Jephthah, a judge of Israel, was known for his leadership and his vow, which later led to a tragic outcome involving his daughter. His message was a diplomatic attempt to resolve the conflict without bloodshed. Jephthah's argument was based on historical claims and divine providence, as he recounted Israel's journey and God's role in giving them the land (<a href="/judges/11-14.htm">Judges 11:14-27</a>). This reflects the biblical principle of seeking peace before engaging in warfare, as well as the importance of remembering God's past deliverances.
