Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a response to covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7-8</a>). The imagery of God's anger "burning" suggests intense displeasure, akin to a consuming fire (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). This reflects the seriousness of Israel's sin, as they turned away from the covenant established at Sinai.<p><b>and He delivered them into the hands of those who plundered them.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereignty in using foreign nations as instruments of judgment. The "plunderers" were likely neighboring tribes and nations, such as the Philistines, Moabites, and Midianites, who frequently oppressed Israel during the period of the Judges. This act of delivering Israel into their hands is a fulfillment of the warnings given in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, where God promised consequences for disobedience.<p><b>He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around,</b><br>The metaphor of God "selling" Israel suggests a transaction where Israel is given over to their enemies as a result of their unfaithfulness. This language is reminiscent of slavery, indicating a loss of freedom and autonomy. The "enemies all around" refers to the geographical reality of Israel being surrounded by hostile nations, emphasizing their vulnerability without God's protection.<p><b>whom they were no longer able to resist.</b><br>This phrase underscores Israel's helplessness without divine aid. Their inability to resist their enemies is a direct consequence of their broken relationship with God. It serves as a reminder of the covenantal promise that obedience would lead to victory (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>), while disobedience would result in defeat. This situation foreshadows the need for a deliverer, pointing to the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who provides victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose anger is kindled against His people due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who have turned away from Him to serve other gods, leading to their oppression by surrounding nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/plunderers.htm">Plunderers</a></b><br>The foreign nations and groups that God allowed to oppress and raid Israel as a consequence of their unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The surrounding nations to whom God "sold" Israel, indicating a loss of divine protection and favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of the Book of Judges involves leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's anger is a response to Israel's covenant unfaithfulness.
