It is mentioned in several biblical accounts, including the story of the Ark of the Covenant being brought there (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). This city was strategically located on the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, making it a suitable place for the Danites to camp. The Danites' journey reflects the broader theme of the tribal allotments and the struggle for land in the Promised Land, as seen throughout the Book of Judges. The act of camping here signifies a temporary settlement, indicating their ongoing search for a permanent inheritance.<p><b>That is why the place west of Kiriath-jearim is called Mahaneh-dan to this day.</b><br>Mahaneh-dan means "Camp of Dan," and it serves as a historical marker of the Danites' journey. This naming reflects the practice of naming places after significant events or people, a common biblical tradition. The phrase "to this day" suggests that the name persisted for a considerable time, indicating the lasting impact of the Danites' actions. This location is also mentioned in <a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>, where the Spirit of the Lord began to stir Samson, a member of the tribe of Dan. The connection to Samson highlights the ongoing narrative of the tribe of Dan and their struggles, as well as the cyclical nature of Israel's history during the time of the Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kiriath-jearim.htm">Kiriath-jearim</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Judah, significant in Israel's history as a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant before it was moved to Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mahaneh-dan.htm">Mahaneh-dan</a></b><br>Meaning "Camp of Dan," this location was named by the Danites during their journey to find a new inheritance, marking a significant event in their tribal history.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for their struggle to secure a permanent inheritance in the Promised Land, leading to their migration and conquest of Laish.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The territory belonging to the tribe of Judah, often associated with leadership and strength among the tribes of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>The Danites' journey from their original allotment to find a new land, reflecting their dissatisfaction and the challenges they faced in securing their inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Danites' journey reflects the consequences of not fully trusting and obeying God's initial provision.

The tribe of Dan, unable to secure its allotted land (<a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>; <a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>), now advances with six hundred armed men, showing how spiritual compromise has already produced geographic restlessness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Camped&#8221; pictures a military staging ground rather than a casual stop. Like Israel&#8217;s wilderness encampments (<a href="/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>), it marks a moment of decision: from here they will either trust the Lord or continue in self-directed plans. Sadly, the narrative shows the latter (<a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27-31</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Kiriath-jearim in Judah&#8221; underscores that Dan is now operating inside another tribe&#8217;s territory. This blurring of boundaries reflects the moral confusion of the era described repeatedly as &#8220;everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; 21:25).<p>&#8226; The site itself had historical weight. It later housed the ark briefly before David moved it to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2-3</a>), reminding us that God&#8217;s presence&#8212;not tribal ambition&#8212;defines Israel&#8217;s true center. Dan&#8217;s camp, in contrast, was rooted in self-interest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That is why the place west of Kiriath-jearim is called Mahaneh-dan to this day</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;That is why the place&#8230;is called&#8221; shows how pivotal moments leave a name-marker. Just as Abraham&#8217;s obedience named &#8220;The LORD Will Provide&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>), Dan&#8217;s choice names &#8220;Camp of Dan.&#8221; Yet the contrast is stark: Abraham&#8217;s altar celebrated faith, while Mahaneh-dan memorializes a tribe taking matters into its own hands.<p>&#8226; &#8220;West of Kiriath-jearim&#8221; explains that Mahaneh-dan is distinct from the earlier location near Zorah where Samson was stirred by the Spirit (<a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>). The writer clarifies so readers won&#8217;t confuse the two encampments, subtly revealing how often Dan had to pitch tents instead of settling obediently.<p>&#8226; &#8220;To this day&#8221; tells us the place-name was still recognized when Judges was compiled, reinforcing the historicity of the account. Scripture roots its theology in real geography; faith rests on fact (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The naming also exposes spiritual drift. Dan stamps its identity on Judah&#8217;s soil, then proceeds to steal Micah&#8217;s idols and plant them in Laish (<a href="/judges/18-17.htm">Judges 18:17-31</a>). The tribe&#8217;s camp becomes a waypoint on a road that ends in institutionalized idolatry&#8212;an early glimpse of the syncretism later condemned by the prophets (<a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-12.htm">Judges 18:12</a> records more than a travel detail. It captures a moment when the tribe of Dan, unsettled in faith, crosses into Judah, sets up a military camp at Kiriath-jearim, and leaves behind the enduring name Mahaneh-dan. The verse highlights disobedience, boundary-blurring, and the lasting impact of choices made apart from God&#8217;s clear guidance, all while reminding us that Scripture&#8217;s narrative stands on verifiable places and times.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">In Kirjath-jearim.</span>--<a href="/joshua/9-17.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day.
