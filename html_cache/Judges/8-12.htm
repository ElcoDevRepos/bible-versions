Their flight signifies a turning point in the battle, indicating their defeat and the collapse of their forces. The Midianites had previously been a significant threat to Israel, as seen in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6:1-6</a>, where they are described as numerous as locusts. Their retreat marks the beginning of the end of Midianite oppression.<p><b>Gideon pursued</b><br>Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, was chosen by God to deliver Israel from the Midianites. His pursuit of Zebah and Zalmunna demonstrates his obedience to God's command and his role as a judge and deliverer. This pursuit is a continuation of the victory God promised in <a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>, where God assured Gideon that He would save Israel through him. Gideon's relentless pursuit reflects his faith and determination to complete the task God set before him.<p><b>and captured these two kings of Midian</b><br>The capture of Zebah and Zalmunna is significant as it represents the complete defeat of the Midianite leadership. In ancient Near Eastern warfare, capturing enemy kings was a symbol of total victory. This act fulfills God's promise to deliver the Midianites into Gideon's hands, as seen in <a href="/judges/7-14.htm">Judges 7:14-15</a>. The capture also serves as a precursor to Gideon's subsequent actions, where he seeks justice for the deaths of his brothers, as detailed later in <a href="/judges/8-18.htm">Judges 8:18-21</a>.<p><b>routing their entire army</b><br>The routing of the Midianite army signifies a decisive victory for Israel. This victory is attributed to God's intervention, as seen throughout the narrative of Gideon's battle against the Midianites. The term "routing" implies a complete and chaotic defeat, where the enemy is scattered and unable to regroup. This mirrors the earlier miraculous victory where Gideon's small army of 300 men defeated the Midianites with God's help, as described in <a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-22</a>.
