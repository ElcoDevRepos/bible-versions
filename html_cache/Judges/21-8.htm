The gathering at Mizpah was a significant assembly where the tribes of Israel convened to address the grievous crime committed in Gibeah, a city of Benjamin. Mizpah, located in the territory of Benjamin, served as a central meeting place for the tribes. The inquiry reflects the seriousness of communal participation in national matters, emphasizing the importance of unity and collective responsibility among the tribes. The phrase "come up before the LORD" indicates a religious and covenantal obligation, as the assembly was not merely political but also spiritual, seeking divine guidance and justice.<p><b>And, in fact, no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.</b><br>Jabesh-gilead was a city located east of the Jordan River in the territory of Gilead, associated with the half-tribe of Manasseh. Its absence from the assembly highlights a breach in the unity and covenantal obligations of the Israelite tribes. Historically, Jabesh-gilead's failure to participate may reflect geographical isolation or political dissent. This absence had significant consequences, as it led to the decision to punish Jabesh-gilead by attacking the city to provide wives for the surviving Benjaminites, illustrating the severe measures taken to restore tribal integrity and continuity.

It was six miles from Pella, on the top of a hill which lies on the road from Pella to Gerasa. For some reason with which we are unacquainted, there seems to have been a bond of intense sympathy between the inhabitants of this town and Benjamin. If their abstinence from the assembly of vengeance was not due to this, we must suppose that the sort of companionship in misery caused by these wild events itself created a sense of union between these communities, for it is the peril of Jabesh which first arouses King Saul to action (1 Samuel 11). and in memory of the deliverance which he effected the men of Jabesh alone save the bodies of Saul and Jonathan from the indignity of rotting on the wall of Bethshan (<a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm" title="And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;">1Samuel 31:11</a>), which gained them the blessing of David (<a href="/context/2_samuel/2-5.htm" title="And David sent messengers to the men of Jabeshgilead, and said to them, Blessed be you of the LORD, that you have showed this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.">2Samuel 2:5-6</a>). We see from these later incidents that Jabesh recovered from the extermination now inflicted on its inhabitants.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/21-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they asked,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Which</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the tribes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1496;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#7789;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7626.htm">Strong's 7626: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rod, staff, club, scepter, tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">failed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to come up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">before</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at Mizpah?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mi&#7779;&#183;p&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4709.htm">Strong's 4709: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mizpah -- the name of several places in Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">And in fact,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
