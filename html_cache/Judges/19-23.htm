This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where the host was responsible for the safety and well-being of those under his roof. The owner&#8217;s intervention highlights the seriousness of the situation and his attempt to prevent a grave sin.<p><b>No, my brothers, do not do this wicked thing!</b><br>The term "brothers" indicates a plea to fellow Israelites, emphasizing a shared identity and moral code. The owner&#8217;s use of "wicked thing" underscores the gravity of the intended actions, which were contrary to the laws and ethics given to Israel. This echoes the moral decline seen in the period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>After all, this man is a guest in my house.</b><br>The concept of a guest was highly esteemed in ancient Near Eastern culture. The host's duty to protect a guest was paramount, often taking precedence over other social norms. This reflects the biblical principle of hospitality seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> with Abraham and the visitors.<p><b>Do not commit this outrage.</b><br>The word "outrage" indicates a severe violation of social and divine law. This plea is reminiscent of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where similar language is used to describe the grievous sin of the inhabitants.

Sometimes when crime is too dark and deadly for ordinary reproach the feelings are more deeply expressed by using a milder word, which is instantly corrected and intensified by the hearer himself. (See <a href="/genesis/34-7.htm" title="And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.">Genesis 34:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-21.htm" title="Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she has worked folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shall you put evil away from among you.">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>.)
