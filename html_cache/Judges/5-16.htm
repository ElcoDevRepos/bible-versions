The imagery of sitting among the sheepfolds implies inactivity or a lack of engagement in the battle that Deborah and Barak were leading against the Canaanite oppressors. In biblical times, sheepfolds were enclosures used to protect sheep, often symbolizing peace and domestic life. The question posed here is rhetorical, highlighting the contrast between the call to action and the choice to remain in a place of comfort and safety. This can be compared to other biblical instances where individuals are called to leave their comfort zones for a greater purpose, such as Abraham leaving Ur or the disciples leaving their nets to follow Jesus.<p><b>to hear the whistling for the flocks?</b><br>The "whistling for the flocks" refers to the sounds shepherds would make to gather or direct their sheep. This detail emphasizes the mundane, everyday activities that the Reubenites prioritized over joining the battle. It suggests a preoccupation with routine and the familiar, rather than responding to the urgent call to arms. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual complacency, where one might focus on worldly concerns instead of heeding God's call. The New Testament echoes this theme in passages like <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, which urges believers to seek first the kingdom of God.<p><b>In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision.</b><br>The tribe of Reuben is singled out for its hesitance and lack of decisive action. Historically, the tribe of Reuben settled on the east side of the Jordan River, which may have contributed to their reluctance to engage in conflicts west of the Jordan. This indecision is a recurring theme in the Bible, where hesitation and doubt often lead to missed opportunities to fulfill God's purposes. The Book of James in the New Testament warns against being double-minded, highlighting the importance of faith and decisiveness in following God's will. The indecision of Reuben serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of spiritual lukewarmness, reminiscent of the church of Laodicea in <a href="/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Reuben, the firstborn son of Jacob.
