This reflects the emotional manipulation often seen in relationships where one party seeks to gain something from the other. In the cultural context, women had limited power and often resorted to emotional appeals to influence their husbands. The weeping indicates the seriousness of her request and her desperation, possibly due to pressure from her people.<p><b>&#8220;You hate me! You do not really love me!</b><br>Her accusation of hatred and lack of love is a tactic to elicit guilt and compliance. In the ancient Near Eastern context, love and loyalty were crucial in marriage, and questioning them was a significant charge. This reflects the tension between personal relationships and cultural or familial obligations, a recurring theme in biblical narratives.<p><b>You have posed to my people a riddle, but have not explained it to me.&#8221;</b><br>The riddle Samson posed was part of the wedding feast, a common practice in ancient times to entertain guests. The riddle itself, based on his encounter with the lion and the honey, symbolizes the secretive and enigmatic nature of God's plans, which are often hidden from human understanding. Her reference to "my people" highlights her divided loyalties between her husband and her Philistine kin.<p><b>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have not even explained it to my father or mother,</b><br>Samson's response emphasizes the importance of family ties and the trust inherent within them. By stating he hasn't even told his parents, he underscores the riddle's significance and his own sense of loyalty and secrecy. This reflects the biblical theme of the family unit as a primary social structure, often used to illustrate spiritual truths.<p><b>so why should I explain it to you?&#8221;</b><br>Samson's rhetorical question points to the hierarchy of relationships and trust. In the biblical context, this highlights the tension between marital and familial obligations. It also foreshadows the eventual betrayal by his wife, paralleling the later betrayal by Delilah, and serves as a type of Christ, who was also betrayed by those close to Him. This phrase underscores the theme of trust and betrayal that runs throughout the narrative of Samson's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, given by God, and his Nazirite vow.

Samson, valuing secrecy over intimacy, refuses even though he has already set aside God&#8217;s command to separate from foreign women. The verse exposes how emotional manipulation and lack of covenant trust fracture relationships, while also advancing God&#8217;s wider purpose: the conflict will drive Samson to confront the Philistines, fulfilling his God-given mission despite his personal failings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Wept before him.</span>--Samson's riddle had the effect of making the whole wedding-feast of this ill-starred marriage one of the most embittered and least joyous that ever fell to a bridegroom's lot. This was a just punishment for his lawless fancies, though God overruled them to His own ends. A weeping, teazing, fretting bride and sullen guests might have served as a warning that Philistine marriages were not good for the sons of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samson's wife</span>, etc. This statement does not follow ver. 15, but is a <span class="accented">parallel</span> narrative to that beginning in ver. 14, "<span class="accented">And they could not in three days</span>," etc., down to the end of ver. 15, bringing the story down to the same point of time, viz., the seventh day. One stream of the narrative tells us what the young men did when Samson had propounded his riddle; the other tells us what Samson's wife did. From the very first, no doubt, she had wished to be in the secret, not perhaps from treacherous motives, but from curiosity, and the natural desire to be in her husband's confidence, and she pressed her request with cajolery and petulance. The young men at the same time had tried to find out the riddle by fair means. But on the seventh day they threatened to burn her and her father unless she found out the riddle for them, and under the terror of this threat she extracted the secret from Samson and divulged it to the Philistine young men. The only difficulty is to explain why a gap of four days occurs in the account between vers. 14 and 15. The most likely thing is, that after three days' vain attempt to find out the riddle, they began to tamper with Samson's wife, offering her money, as the Philistine lords did to Delilah (<a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>), though the narrative does not mention it; but that on the seventh day, becoming desperate, and thinking that the woman was not doing her best, they resorted to the dreadful threat of burning her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/14-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Samson&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8123.htm">Strong's 8123: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samson -- a deliverer of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1448;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came to him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
