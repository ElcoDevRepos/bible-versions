In this instance, the counting was related to the aftermath of a civil conflict within Israel. The act of counting the people reflects the need for accountability and understanding the full scope of the tribes' participation in the assembly. This echoes other biblical instances where censuses were taken, such as in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, where God commands Moses to count the Israelites for military organization.<p><b>none of the residents of Jabesh-gilead were there</b><br>Jabesh-gilead was a city located east of the Jordan River, in the territory of Gilead. Its absence from the assembly is significant, as it indicates a lack of participation in the collective action of the tribes of Israel. Historically, Jabesh-gilead had connections with the tribe of Benjamin, which may explain their absence due to the conflict against Benjamin. This absence led to severe consequences for Jabesh-gilead, as seen in the subsequent verses. The city later plays a role in the narrative of King Saul, who rescues it from the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11), highlighting its ongoing significance in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel who are gathered at Mizpah to address the issue of the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, which faced near extinction due to a civil war with the other tribes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>A significant gathering place for the Israelites, where they often assembled for important decisions and events.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>The city in Benjamin where a grievous crime occurred, leading to the conflict between Benjamin and the other tribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabesh-gilead.htm">Jabesh-gilead</a></b><br>A city that did not send representatives to the assembly at Mizpah, leading to further actions by the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin_and_disunity.htm">The Consequences of Sin and Disunity</a></b><br>The near destruction of the tribe of Benjamin serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of sin and disunity among God's people.
