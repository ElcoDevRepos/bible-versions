His death at a "ripe old age" signifies a life that was long and fulfilled, often seen as a blessing from God. This phrase indicates that Gideon lived a full life after his military and leadership accomplishments. In biblical times, living to an old age was considered a sign of divine favor and wisdom. Gideon's life and leadership are chronicled in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6-8</a>, where he is portrayed as a reluctant leader who ultimately trusts in God's power. His story is a testament to God's ability to use unlikely individuals for His purposes.<p><b>and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash</b><br>The burial in the family tomb signifies honor and respect, maintaining the tradition of being laid to rest with one's ancestors. This practice was common in ancient Israel, reflecting the importance of family lineage and heritage. Joash, Gideon's father, was initially skeptical of Gideon's divine calling but later supported him. The family tomb would have been a place of significance, marking the continuation of the family line and the preservation of their legacy. This burial practice underscores the cultural emphasis on family and the continuity of faith and tradition.<p><b>in Ophrah of the Abiezrites</b><br>Ophrah was Gideon's hometown, located in the territory of the tribe of Manasseh. The mention of the Abiezrites identifies Gideon's clan within the tribe, highlighting his humble beginnings. The Abiezrites were a smaller clan, and Gideon's rise to leadership is a reminder of God's ability to elevate the lowly. Ophrah served as a central location for Gideon's activities, including the destruction of the altar of Baal and the gathering of troops for battle. This geographical reference roots the narrative in a specific historical and cultural context, emphasizing the local impact of Gideon's leadership and the divine intervention in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, also known as Jerubbaal, who led Israel to victory over the Midianites with God's guidance.

Scripture often uses such timing markers to highlight God&#8217;s faithfulness across seasons&#8212;think of &#8220;After these things&#8221; in <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>, when God reaffirms His promise to Abram.

The mention of Joash underscores:<p>&#8226; Divine grace&#8212;God chose a man from a small clan (6:15), echoing <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27&#8211;29</a>.<p>&#8226; Covenant continuity&#8212;family names recur so readers connect God&#8217;s acts across generations, as with &#8220;Moses son of Amram&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Died at a ripe old age</b><p>Long life is a covenant blessing (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>). Gideon&#8217;s peaceful passing contrasts with turbulent deaths elsewhere in Judges (e.g., Abimelech in 9:53&#8211;54). Like Abraham (&#8220;Then Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>) and David (&#8220;So David rested with his fathers,&#8221; <a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>), Gideon enjoys the reward of faithful obedience despite earlier flaws (<a href="/judges/8-24.htm">Judges 8:24&#8211;27</a>).

Gideon is not discarded like a defeated enemy (cf. <a href="/psalms/79-2.htm">Psalm 79:2&#8211;3</a>); he is treated with dignity. Burial rites also reinforce community memory, helping Israel recall God&#8217;s deliverance through this judge&#8212;similar to how Joseph&#8217;s bones reminded Israel of the Exodus promise (<a href="/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the tomb of his father Joash</b><p>Resting with ancestors emphasized covenant identity (<a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29&#8211;32</a>).
