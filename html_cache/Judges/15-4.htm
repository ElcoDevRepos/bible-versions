The Hebrew word translated as "foxes" can also mean "jackals," which are more common in the region and often travel in packs, making them easier to catch in large numbers. This event takes place in the context of Samson's ongoing conflict with the Philistines, who were oppressing Israel at the time. The number 300 is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing completeness or divine intervention, as seen in Gideon's army in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>. Samson's ability to catch so many animals reflects his role as a judge empowered by God to deliver Israel.<p><b>And he took torches,</b><br>The use of torches indicates a planned act of destruction. In ancient warfare, fire was a common tool for devastation, especially in agricultural societies. The torch symbolizes judgment and divine retribution, as seen in other biblical passages where fire represents God's presence or judgment, such as in the burning bush (Exodus 3) or the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).<p><b>turned the foxes tail-to-tail,</b><br>This method of tying the animals together would ensure that they could not run in a straight line, causing more widespread damage as they panicked and ran through the fields. This act of tying the animals tail-to-tail is unique and demonstrates Samson's ingenuity. It also reflects the chaotic and destructive nature of sin and rebellion against God, as the Philistines were experiencing through their oppression of Israel.<p><b>and fastened a torch between each pair of tails.</b><br>By placing a torch between each pair of tails, Samson ensured that the fire would spread rapidly and uncontrollably. This act of sabotage was a direct attack on the Philistine economy, as agriculture was their primary source of sustenance and wealth. The fire would destroy their grain, vineyards, and olive groves, symbolizing the judgment of God upon those who oppress His people. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and judgment that comes through Jesus Christ, who is described as the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and who brings both salvation and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, given by God, and his complex character.

Here, and in <a href="/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10</a>, the gregarious jackals, the canis <span class="accented">aureus</span>, are undoubtedly meant. <span class="cmt_word">Caught</span>. The Hebrew word means especially <span class="accented">caught in nets</span> or snares. See <a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a> (have <span class="accented">taken</span> nothing at all); <a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a> (let his net catch himself); <a href="/jeremiah/18-22.htm">Jeremiah 18:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> (<span class="accented">taken</span>), etc. And it is in this sense that the A.V. uses the word <span class="accented">caught</span>. A clever sportsman, as no doubt Samson was, would have no difficulty whatever in netting or snaring 300 jackals, which always move in packs, and would be attracted by the vineyards of Thimnathah, for which their partiality is well known (see <a href="/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5</a>, note). The writer of the additional article <span class="accented">Fox</span> in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' states that he had tried the experiment of throwing grapes to the foxes, jackals, and wolves in the Zoological Gardens. The wolves would not touch them, the others ate them with avidity. <span class="cmt_word">Took firebrands</span>, etc. Many cavils have been directed against the truth of this account, but without the slightest reason. The terrified animals, with the burning torches and the blazing straw behind them, would necessarily run forwards. Samson would, of course, start the couples at numerous different points, and no doubt have a number of Hebrews to assist him.
