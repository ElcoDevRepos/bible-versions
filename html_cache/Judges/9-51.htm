Towers served as defensive structures, providing a vantage point for surveillance and protection against invaders. In the context of <a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>, the city is Shechem, a significant location in Israel's history, known for its covenantal associations (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>). The tower symbolizes a place of refuge and strength, reminiscent of God being described as a "strong tower" in <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>, offering safety to those who seek Him.<p><b>and all the men, women, and leaders of the city fled there</b><br>The flight of the city's inhabitants, including its leaders, to the tower indicates a moment of desperation and fear. This reflects the chaotic and violent period of the Judges, where leadership was often unstable, and cities were vulnerable to internal and external threats. The inclusion of both men and women highlights the indiscriminate nature of the threat posed by Abimelech, Gideon's son, who sought to consolidate power through violence. This act of fleeing to the tower can be seen as a parallel to seeking refuge in God during times of trouble, as seen in Psalms 46:1.<p><b>They locked themselves in</b><br>Locking themselves in the tower was a defensive measure, indicating the severity of the threat they faced. This action underscores the human instinct to seek security and protection in times of danger. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of seeking refuge, as seen in the Psalms, where God is often depicted as a fortress and deliverer (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). The act of locking themselves in can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual security found in faith and trust in God.<p><b>and went up to the roof of the tower</b><br>Ascending to the roof of the tower was likely a strategic move, providing a higher ground for defense and a better view of the surrounding area. In biblical narratives, rooftops often serve as places of significant events or revelations (e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>, <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>). The rooftop in this context becomes a place of final stand and confrontation, foreshadowing the dramatic conclusion of Abimelech's siege. This ascent can also be seen as a symbolic act of reaching towards God, seeking His intervention and deliverance in dire circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon, who declared himself king and led a violent campaign against Shechem and other cities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_of_thebez.htm">The City of Thebez</a></b><br>A city that Abimelech attacked after his campaign against Shechem.

Scripture often pictures a &#8220;tower&#8221; as a place of firm protection&#8212;think of <a href="/psalms/61-3.htm">Psalm 61:3</a>, &#8220;For You have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy,&#8221; or <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>, &#8220;The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.&#8221; Here, however, the safety is physical, not spiritual. The writer wants us to see both the literal stone tower inside Thebez and the contrast between trusting masonry and trusting the LORD (compare <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the men, women, and leaders of the city fled there</b><p>Everyone&#8212;civilians and officials alike&#8212;recognizes the same danger and races to the same refuge. Their unity under threat recalls the way Noah&#8217;s family entered the ark together in <a href="/genesis/7-7.htm">Genesis 7:7</a> and the way the Israelites gathered behind fortified walls during siege in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-2.htm">2 Chronicles 32:2&#8211;5</a>. The text underscores that no one believes they can survive outside the tower; all worldly status evaporates when judgment approaches (see <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They locked themselves in</b><p>Shutting the door seems prudent, yet it also signals self-reliance. Like the residents of Jericho who &#8220;shut up&#8221; their city against Israel (<a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>), the people of Thebez depend on bolts and bars. Scripture repeatedly exposes the futility of trusting mere gates&#8212;<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a> warns, &#8220;Unless the LORD guards the city, the watchman keeps awake in vain,&#8221; and <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a> reminds believers that only Christ opens and shuts with final authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went up to the roof of the tower</b><p>Ascending higher gives a tactical advantage and, ironically, sets the stage for their unexpected victory. From that rooftop a single woman will drop an upper millstone on Abimelech&#8217;s head (<a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a>), fulfilling the principle that &#8220;the LORD saves, not with sword and spear&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). Like Rahab&#8217;s household on Jericho&#8217;s roof (<a href="/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>) or David on a rooftop observing the city (<a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>), the elevated place becomes the pivot of God&#8217;s providence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-51.htm">Judges 9:51</a> captures a desperate population retreating to the strongest human refuge they possess&#8212;a literal stone tower.
