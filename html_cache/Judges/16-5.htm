These cities were part of a confederation that often acted in unison, especially in matters of military and political strategy. The Philistines were a significant adversary of Israel during the period of the Judges, often oppressing the Israelites and engaging in battles with them. The fact that these leaders approached Delilah indicates the seriousness of their intent to capture Samson, who had been a thorn in their side due to his extraordinary strength and the havoc he wreaked on their people.<p><b>&#8220;Entice him and find out the source of his great strength</b><br>The Philistines recognized that Samson's strength was not natural and sought to discover its source. This reflects a common theme in the ancient world where physical prowess was often attributed to divine favor or supernatural means. The use of the word "entice" suggests a plan of seduction and deception, which is consistent with Delilah's role in the narrative. This also echoes the earlier story of Samson's first wife, who was similarly used by the Philistines to extract information from Samson (<a href="/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15-17</a>).<p><b>and how we can overpower him to tie him up and subdue him.</b><br>The Philistines' goal was not just to capture Samson but to neutralize him completely. The language of "tie him up and subdue him" indicates a desire to render him powerless, both physically and symbolically. This reflects the broader conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines, where the latter sought to dominate and control the former. The Philistines' fear of Samson's strength underscores the threat he posed to their dominance in the region.<p><b>Then each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.&#8221;</b><br>The offer of "eleven hundred shekels of silver" from each lord is a substantial sum, indicating the high value they placed on capturing Samson. This amount of silver would have been a significant fortune in the ancient world, reflecting the desperation and determination of the Philistine leaders. The use of silver as a form of payment is consistent with other biblical narratives, such as the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>), drawing a parallel between Delilah's betrayal of Samson and Judas's betrayal of Christ. This connection highlights themes of betrayal and the corrupting influence of money.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.

Philistine rulers recruit Delilah, banking on seduction, secrecy, and silver to pierce the divine strength empowering Samson. The verse warns that spiritual opposition often targets personal relationships, tempts through fleshly desires, and leverages greed to bind and subdue. Believers are reminded to guard their calling, resist enticement, and prize faithfulness over any earthly reward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The lords of the Philistines.</span>--The five "satraps." (See Note on <a href="/judges/3-3.htm" title="Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelled in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon to the entering in of Hamath.">Judges 3:3</a>.) If she were what Josephus asserts, the Philistines might both get access to her, and tempt the cupidity of an unprincipled and degraded mind. Had she been of their own race, threats would probably have been even more effectual with her than with the lady of Timnath (<a href="/judges/13-15.htm" title="And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.">Judges 13:15</a>).

The same sum recurs in <a href="/judges/17-2.htm" title="And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed, and spoke of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my son.">Judges 17:2</a> as the amount laid by for the construction of teraphim by the mother of Micah. If the five lords each gave 1,100 shekels, the amount would be nearly two talents of silver (<a href="/context/exodus/38-25.htm" title="And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and three score and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:">Exodus 38:25-26</a>)--a most enormous bribe for that age, and especially to such a woman as Delilah.
