Dreams in the ancient Near East were often considered messages from the divine, and this dream serves as a prophetic revelation. The setting underscores the fear and uncertainty among the Midianites, contrasting with the assurance given to Gideon by God. This moment is pivotal, as it confirms God's promise of victory to Gideon, aligning with the biblical theme of God using the weak to confound the strong.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, I had a dream,&#8221; he said,</b><br>The phrase "Behold, I had a dream" emphasizes the significance of the dream as a divine message. In biblical narratives, dreams often serve as a means of divine communication, as seen with Joseph in Genesis and Daniel in Babylon. This dream is a tool used by God to instill fear in the Midianites and to encourage Gideon. The dream's recounting to a friend suggests a communal sharing of divine insights, which was common in ancient cultures.<p><b>&#8220;and I saw a loaf of barley bread come tumbling into the Midianite camp.</b><br>Barley bread, a staple of the poor, symbolizes Gideon and his humble origins. Barley was less valued than wheat, reflecting Gideon's status as the least in his family and his tribe's insignificance. The tumbling loaf represents the unexpected and seemingly insignificant force that God uses to achieve His purposes. This imagery aligns with the biblical theme of God choosing the lowly and despised to accomplish His will, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>.<p><b>It struck the tent so hard that the tent overturned and collapsed.&#8221;</b><br>The tent represents the Midianite power and presence in the land. The collapse of the tent signifies the total defeat and removal of the Midianite oppression over Israel. This imagery of destruction is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God delivers His people from their enemies, such as the fall of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>. The dream's fulfillment demonstrates God's faithfulness to His promises and His ability to deliver His people through unexpected means. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, where the seemingly weak and humble triumph over the strong.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Notice:<p>&#8226; The Midianite does not consult a prophet&#8212;God simply drops truth into his subconscious.<p>&#8226; Gideon receives courage not from Israelite lips but from the enemy&#8217;s own mouth, echoing how Rahab&#8217;s words boosted Israel in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>.<p>The episode underscores <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>&#8212;if God is for us, who can be against us?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Behold, I had a dream,&#8221; he said,</b><p>The soldier&#8217;s urgency&#8212;&#8220;Behold&#8221;&#8212;signals that what follows is unforgettable. God ensures the account is relayed with vividness so Gideon cannot mistake its importance.

The loaf&#8217;s motion&#8212;&#8220;tumbling&#8221;&#8212;suggests an unstoppable, gravity-propelled force, not human craftsmanship.

What the world deems small, God wields as a battering ram.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It struck the tent so hard that the tent overturned and collapsed.</b><p>The &#8220;tent&#8221; likely refers to the Midianite command tent, symbolizing the whole army.

Cross-reference: &#8220;One of you routes a thousand, because the LORD your God fights for you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a>). The collapse foretells the rout in <a href="/judges/7-21.htm">Judges 7:21-22</a>, affirming <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7-8</a>&#8212;&#8220;They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a> reveals a divinely timed eavesdropping moment where God uses an enemy&#8217;s dream to confirm victory through Gideon&#8217;s unlikely, humble force. A coarse barley loaf signifies weak Israel empowered by the Almighty, tumbling irresistibly into the camp and flattening it. The scene showcases God&#8217;s sovereignty over timing, means, and outcome, reminding believers that He still employs the ordinary to accomplish the extraordinary when we trust and obey His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Behold, I dreamed a dream.</span>--Since dreams, no less than the Bath Kol, were recognised channels for Divine intimations (<a href="/genesis/41-12.htm" title="And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.">Genesis 41:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm" title="And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.">Numbers 12:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm" title="And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.">1Samuel 28:6</a>; <a href="/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>, &c.), Gideon would feel doubly assured.<p><span class= "bld">A cake.</span>--The Hebrew word <span class= "ital">tsalol </span>(or <span class= "ital">tselil </span>in the Keri, or margin) is a word which occurs nowhere else. Rabbis Kimchi and Tanchun derive it from <span class= "ital">tsalal, </span>"he tinkled" (as in <span class= "ital">tselselim </span>and other names for musical instruments), or "he overshadowed." Neither derivation yields any sense. The Chaldee, Syriac, and Rashi render it "a cake baked on coals," and so, too, the LXX. (since such is the meaning of <span class= "ital">magie</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the Vulgate (<span class= "ital">panis subcinericius</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and Josephus (<span class= "ital">maza krithin?</span>)<span class= "ital">; </span>this seems to be the true sense. Ewald makes it mean "a dry rattling crust." Niebuhr tells us that the desert Arabs thrust a round lump of dough into hot ashes, then take it out and eat it. (<span class= "ital">Arab., </span>p. 52.)<p><span class= "bld">Of barley bread.</span>--Josephus helps us to see the significance of the symbol by adding, "which men can (hardly) eat for its coarseness." It must be remembered that the Israelites had been reduced to such poverty by these raids that the mass of them would have nothing to subsist on but common barley bread such as that used to this day, with bitter complaints, by the Fellahin of Palestine. Among the Greeks also <span class= "ital">"</span>barley bread" was proverbial as a kind of food hardly fit to be eaten, although such was the poverty which the Saviour bore for our sakes that it seems to have been the ordinary food of Him and His apostles (<a href="/john/6-9.htm" title="There is a lad here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?">John 6:9</a>). "A cake of barley bread" would, therefore, naturally recall the thought of the Israelites, who were no doubt taunted by their enemies with being reduced to this food; just as Dr. Johnson defined oats as "food for horses in England, and for men in Scotland." Thus, in <a href="/1_kings/4-28.htm" title="Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they to the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.">1Kings 4:28</a>, the "barley" is only for the horses and dromedaries. "If the Midianites were accustomed to call Gideon and his band 'eaters of barley bread,' as their successors, the haughty Bedouins, often do to ridicule their enemies, the application would be the more natural" (Thomson, <span class= "ital">Land and Book, </span>p. 447). Josephus makes the soldier say that, as barley is the vilest of all seed, so the Israelites were the vilest of all the people of Asia. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A cake</span>.
