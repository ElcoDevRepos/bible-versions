It was a time of vulnerability and uncertainty, as night often symbolizes in Scripture. The timing underscores God's sovereignty and His ability to work in unexpected ways. Nighttime encounters with God are seen elsewhere, such as with Jacob in <a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22-32</a>.<p><b>the LORD said to Gideon</b><br>The direct communication from the LORD highlights the personal relationship between God and Gideon. This divine interaction is consistent with God's pattern of calling and guiding leaders in Israel, as seen with Moses in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> and Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1.htm">Joshua 1</a>. It emphasizes God's initiative in delivering His people.<p><b>Get up and go down against the camp</b><br>This command is a call to action, requiring faith and obedience from Gideon. The phrase "go down" suggests a descent, possibly indicating the geographical setting where the Midianite camp was located in a valley. This mirrors other biblical narratives where God calls His servants to confront challenges directly, such as David against Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>.<p><b>for I have delivered it into your hand</b><br>This assurance of victory is a common theme in the Old Testament, where God promises deliverance before the battle is fought. It reflects God's omnipotence and faithfulness to His covenant people. The phrase "into your hand" signifies complete control and victory, similar to God's promises to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>. This prefigures the ultimate victory found in Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Gideon has just watched his army shrink from 32,000 to 300 (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2&#8211;8</a>). Darkness blankets the valley, mirroring any fears that might still linger in his heart. Yet God often chooses the night to speak&#8212;think of His covenant promise to Abram under the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), Samuel hearing the call while &#8220;the lamp of God had not yet gone out&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3&#8211;4</a>), or Paul receiving a midnight vision in Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9&#8211;10</a>). The pattern reminds us:<p>&#8226; God is not limited by human schedules.<p>&#8226; Quiet hours can become the clearest moments of divine reassurance.<p>&#8226; When circumstances seem darkest, revelation can be brightest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD said to Gideon</b><p>The personal covenant name appears again, just as in Gideon&#8217;s original commissioning (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14</a>). The same voice who called, equipped, and trimmed the troops now speaks with intimate authority. Scripture consistently shows that victories begin with God&#8217;s initiative, not human strategy (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Direct communication underscores relationship: &#8220;My sheep hear My voice&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word is enough; nothing else needs to validate it (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The repetition of divine speaking throughout <a href="/bsb/judges/6.htm">Judges 6&#8211;7</a> explains why Gideon&#8217;s story moves from trembling to triumph.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Get up</b><p>A concise command propels Gideon from contemplation to movement. Similar imperatives punctuate key turning points: &#8220;Tell the Israelites to move on&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15</a>), &#8220;Stand up! Why have you fallen facedown?&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/7-10.htm">Joshua 7:10</a>). Faith does not stall; it rises.<p>&#8226; Obedience often begins with a simple act&#8212;standing, stepping, speaking.<p>&#8226; Delay feeds doubt; prompt action nourishes confidence (<a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>).<p>&#8226; God calls leaders&#8212;and by extension His people&#8212;to readiness, not passivity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and go down against the camp</b><p>Specific direction replaces vague intention. The Midianite host lies in the valley below (<a href="/judges/7-8.htm">Judges 7:8</a>). Gideon must descend physically and, in doing so, confront his fears spiritually. David &#8220;ran quickly toward the battle line&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>); Jonathan said, &#8220;Come, let us cross over&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-1.htm">1 Samuel 14:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God identifies the real battlefield, sparing us from fighting the wrong fights.<p>&#8226; Going &#8220;down&#8221; hints at humility&#8212;victory never rests on high ground pride.<p>&#8226; Faith takes the offensive. As James reminds, &#8220;I will show you my faith by my deeds&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for I have delivered it into your hand</b><p>The promise is stated in completed terms before a sword is drawn, echoing earlier assurances: &#8220;See, I have given Jericho into your hand&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>); &#8220;The LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand&#8221; (<a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; God announces outcomes in advance to anchor courage (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb tense signals certainty&#8212;victory is His deed, not merely Gideon&#8217;s hope.<p>&#8226; Such declarations transform commands into confident strides rather than hesitant steps.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9</a> turns a shrinking army and a nighttime setting into a stage for God&#8217;s sovereignty. The verse teaches that:<p>&#8226; God chooses moments of vulnerability to speak assurance.<p>&#8226; His personal word is both the source and guarantee of victory.<p>&#8226; Obedience starts with rising, continues with going, and rests on a finished promise.<p>With the battle declared won before it begins, Gideon (and every believer) learns that stepping into God&#8217;s directive means stepping into a victory already secured by the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">I have delivered it into thine hand.</span>--Comp. <a href="/judges/4-14.htm" title="And Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand: is not the LORD gone out before you?
