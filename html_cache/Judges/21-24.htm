The phrase "at that time" often marks a transition or conclusion in biblical narratives, suggesting a return to normalcy or a new beginning after a period of turmoil. It reflects the cyclical nature of the Book of Judges, where periods of chaos are followed by temporary peace.<p><b>each of the Israelites returned from there</b><br>The Israelites had gathered at Mizpah and later at Shiloh to address the crisis involving the tribe of Benjamin. The phrase "returned from there" signifies the end of a collective national effort and the dispersal of the tribes back to their respective territories. This return underscores the decentralized nature of Israelite society during the time of the Judges, where unity was often temporary and driven by necessity.<p><b>to his own tribe and clan,</b><br>The mention of "tribe and clan" highlights the tribal structure of ancient Israel, which was foundational to their identity and social organization. Each tribe and clan had its own leadership, land, and responsibilities. This structure is evident throughout the Old Testament, where tribal affiliations often determined one's role and inheritance. The return to their tribes and clans signifies a restoration of order and a return to daily life after the collective action against Benjamin.<p><b>each to his own inheritance.</b><br>Inheritance in ancient Israel was not merely about land but was deeply tied to identity, family lineage, and God's promises to the patriarchs. The concept of inheritance is rooted in the covenantal promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where the land was a tangible sign of God's faithfulness. Returning to one's inheritance symbolizes a return to God's provision and blessing. It also reflects the importance of land in maintaining the social and economic stability of the tribes. This return to inheritance can be seen as a type of restoration, echoing themes of redemption and fulfillment found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective people of God, consisting of the twelve tribes descended from the sons of Jacob.

The phrase marks the close of a difficult season in Israel&#8217;s history, immediately following the war against Benjamin (<a href="/bsb/judges/20.htm">Judges 20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8211; It signals God-ordained transition: there was a period for assembling in judgment, and now a time for returning home (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>; <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a>).<p>&#8211; Though the nation had been fractured by sin and civil conflict, the wording reminds us that God still oversees each moment of Israel&#8217;s story, moving them from crisis toward order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each of the Israelites returned from there</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;From there&#8221; points to Shiloh, where the people had gathered before the LORD (<a href="/judges/21-12.htm">Judges 21:12, 19</a>).<p>&#8211; Their unified action shifts from collective warfare to individual obedience&#8212;each person taking personal responsibility to leave the assembly and go back (cf. <a href="/joshua/22-4.htm">Joshua 22:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>).<p>&#8211; The return underscores that national repentance and reconciliation ultimately show up in ordinary life: fields tilled, families restored, worship resumed in hometowns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to his own tribe and clan</b><p>&#8211; God had arranged Israel by tribes and smaller family groupings (<a href="/numbers/1-52.htm">Numbers 1:52</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10</a>).<p>&#8211; After acting as one army, they now step back into the structures God established, affirming that covenant identity is lived locally.<p>&#8211; The verse highlights accountability: each clan would now address the lingering consequences of the conflict, ensuring that the lessons learned at Shiloh were carried back home (cf. <a href="/joshua/7-16.htm">Joshua 7:16&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each to his own inheritance</b><p>&#8211; The inheritance refers to the parcels of land allotted under Joshua (<a href="/bsb/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8211; Returning &#8220;each to his own&#8221; stresses personal stewardship: God&#8217;s gifts are to be protected, cultivated, and passed on (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>).<p>&#8211; It also reaffirms covenant promise&#8212;despite the nation&#8217;s moral spiral, God&#8217;s grant of land still stands (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-21.htm">Deuteronomy 4:21</a>).<p>&#8211; By ending the account this way, Scripture contrasts the chaos that has filled Judges with the stability God always intended for His people (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43&#8211;45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/21-24.htm">Judges 21:24</a> records Israel&#8217;s move from collective turmoil back to God-assigned normalcy. At the LORD&#8217;s chosen moment, every Israelite departs Shiloh, re-embracing tribal and family structures and resuming stewardship of the land God had promised. The verse affirms that, even after grievous sin and civil war, God restores order, honors His covenant, and calls each believer to live faithfully within the specific sphere He has entrusted to them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every man to his inheritance</span>.
