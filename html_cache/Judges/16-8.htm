They were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. The "lords" refers to the rulers or leaders of the five major Philistine cities: Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. These leaders were often involved in military and political decisions, especially those concerning their conflicts with Israel.<p><b>brought her seven fresh bowstrings</b><br>The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting a thorough attempt to bind Samson. Bowstrings were typically made from animal tendons or intestines, known for their strength and flexibility. The use of "fresh" bowstrings implies they were newly made and thus at their strongest, indicating the Philistines' serious intent to subdue Samson.<p><b>that had not been dried</b><br>Fresh bowstrings that had not been dried would be more pliable and potentially stronger than those that had been dried out. This detail emphasizes the Philistines' desire to ensure Samson's capture by using the most effective means available. The undried state of the bowstrings could also symbolize the Philistines' fresh and ongoing threat to Israel.<p><b>and she tied him up with them</b><br>Delilah's role in this narrative is pivotal. Her actions are a direct betrayal of Samson, highlighting themes of trust and deception. This act of tying Samson is symbolic of the spiritual and moral bondage that can result from turning away from God's commands. Delilah's involvement also reflects the recurring biblical theme of foreign influence leading to Israel's downfall, as seen in other instances where Israelite leaders are led astray by foreign women.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A woman from the Valley of Sorek whom Samson loved.

Earlier they had come to Delilah with the promise of silver (<a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>), showing how earthly power often uses wealth to advance its purposes. Their presence reminds us of the repeated cycle in Judges: Israel sins, enemies oppress, and God raises a deliverer (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16-19</a>). Here, however, the oppressors take the offensive against God&#8217;s chosen judge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Brought her</b><p>The men place the materials straight into Delilah&#8217;s hands. This underscores their full confidence in her cooperation and reveals the depth of her betrayal (contrast <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>, where loyalty marks covenant love). Delilah becomes an instrument of temptation much like the Moabite women in <a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a> or Jezebel in <a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25-26</a>&#8212;outsiders who lure God&#8217;s people away from obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seven fresh bowstrings</b><p>Seven often signals completeness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4</a>). The Philistines hope these &#8220;complete&#8221; restraints will decisively end Samson&#8217;s strength. Bowstrings, made from animal sinew, mirror the weapons Samson had once mocked (<a href="/judges/15-15.htm">Judges 15:15</a>). The irony is thick: they choose hunting cords to trap the hunter.<p>Bullet points for significance:<p>&#8226; Symbolic completeness: a man famous for unparalleled power is to be subdued by a perfect set of cords.<p>&#8226; Flesh versus Spirit: sinew represents human effort; Samson&#8217;s strength is divine (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Echo of covenant language: seven also marks oaths (<a href="/genesis/21-28.htm">Genesis 21:28-31</a>); Delilah twists an oath-like number for deceit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That had not been dried</b><p>Freshness means maximum strength and elasticity. Just as new ropes failed in <a href="/judges/15-13.htm">Judges 15:13-14</a>, these new cords are thought to succeed. The Philistines trust tangible strength; yet Scripture consistently shows God undoing such confidence (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). Their choice exposes a worldview rooted in the material, ignoring the spiritual source of Samson&#8217;s might.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And she tied him up with them</b><p>Delilah moves from enticement to action, embodying <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>: &#8220;each one is tempted&#8230;then desire&#8230;gives birth to sin.&#8221; Samson allows himself to be bound&#8212;perhaps out of misplaced confidence (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>) or naivet&#233; toward Delilah&#8217;s motives (<a href="/judges/16-6.htm">Judges 16:6</a>). The binding anticipates the final scene where real cords&#8212;and compromised vows&#8212;lead to Samson&#8217;s downfall (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). Yet even here, God&#8217;s purpose advances: human schemes will ultimately bring Samson into position for his greatest act of deliverance (<a href="/judges/16-30.htm">Judges 16:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/16-8.htm">Judges 16:8</a> captures a moment when human power plots to overthrow God-given strength. The Philistine rulers, wielding wealth and cunning, deliver seven undried bowstrings to Delilah, hoping perfect, fresh sinews will bind Samson. Delilah&#8217;s betrayal progresses from words to deeds, and Samson&#8217;s casual submission foreshadows the danger of treating divine gifts lightly. The verse warns against trusting in material strategies while reminding us that God&#8217;s purposes stand, even when His servant stumbles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/16-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the lords</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(sar&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5633.htm">Strong's 5633: </a> </span><span class="str2">An axle, a peer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6430.htm">Strong's 6430: </a> </span><span class="str2">Philistines -- inhabitants of Philistia</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
