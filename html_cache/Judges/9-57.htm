The men of Shechem had supported Abimelech in his violent rise to power, including the murder of his seventy brothers. This act of treachery and bloodshed was not overlooked by God, who is portrayed throughout Scripture as a just judge (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). The concept of retributive justice, where one's evil deeds return upon them, is a recurring theme in the Bible (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). Shechem, a significant city in Israel's history, was a place of covenant renewal (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>) and now becomes a site of divine retribution. This reflects the biblical principle that God holds nations and individuals accountable for their actions.<p><b>So the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came upon them.</b><br>Jotham, the only surviving son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), had pronounced a curse upon Abimelech and the men of Shechem from Mount Gerizim (<a href="/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7-21</a>). This curse was a prophetic declaration that the alliance between Abimelech and Shechem would lead to mutual destruction. The fulfillment of Jotham's curse underscores the biblical theme of prophecy and its realization, as seen in other instances where God's word through His prophets comes to pass (<a href="/1_kings/13-32.htm">1 Kings 13:32</a>). Jotham's curse serves as a reminder of the power of spoken words and the sovereignty of God in orchestrating events according to His divine will. The narrative also foreshadows the ultimate justice and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign judge who enacts justice and brings about the consequences of wickedness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_shechem.htm">Men of Shechem</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Shechem who conspired with Abimelech and committed acts of treachery and violence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (Jerubbaal) who sought power through violence and treachery, ultimately meeting a violent end.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The youngest son of Gideon who escaped Abimelech's massacre and pronounced a curse upon Abimelech and the men of Shechem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerubbaal.htm">Jerubbaal (Gideon)</a></b><br>The father of Abimelech and Jotham, known for his role as a judge and leader of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice is perfect and inevitable.
