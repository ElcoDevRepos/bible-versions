The term "seizing" indicates a forceful taking, which aligns with the biblical narrative of Israel's military campaigns under divine mandate. This conquest was part of God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The act of seizing land also reflects the fulfillment of God's covenant promises and the establishment of Israel as a nation.<p><b>from the Arnon to the Jabbok</b><br>The Arnon and the Jabbok are significant geographical markers in the ancient Near East. The Arnon River served as the southern boundary of the territory taken from the Amorites, while the Jabbok River marked the northern boundary. This area is part of modern-day Jordan. The Arnon is mentioned in <a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13-14</a> as a boundary of Moab, and the Jabbok is where Jacob wrestled with God (<a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22-32</a>). These rivers delineate a significant portion of the Transjordan region, which was strategically important for trade and military movements.<p><b>and from the wilderness to the Jordan</b><br>The "wilderness" likely refers to the desert regions east of the Jordan River, which were less hospitable and more challenging to inhabit. The Jordan River itself is a critical geographical feature in the biblical narrative, symbolizing the boundary between the wilderness wanderings and the Promised Land. Crossing the Jordan River was a significant event for the Israelites, marking their entry into Canaan under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 3-4). This phrase emphasizes the extent of the territory acquired, stretching from the less fertile wilderness to the fertile lands along the Jordan, which were crucial for agriculture and settlement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and his vow.
