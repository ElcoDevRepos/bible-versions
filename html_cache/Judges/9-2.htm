It was a central city in the hill country of Ephraim and had been a site of covenant renewal (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>). The leaders of Shechem were influential figures, and their support was crucial for any political maneuver. This request to the leaders indicates a strategic move to gain political power by appealing to local authority.<p><b>&#8216;Is it better for you that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or just one man?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the political tension and potential for division among the sons of Jerubbaal, also known as Gideon. Gideon had refused kingship (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>), but his sons were numerous, suggesting a potential for fragmented leadership. The question implies that a single ruler would provide more stability than multiple leaders, a common theme in monarchic arguments throughout history. This also foreshadows the dangers of centralized power, as seen in the later monarchy of Israel.<p><b>Remember that I am your own flesh and blood.</b><br>This appeal to kinship is a powerful persuasive tool, emphasizing loyalty and familial bonds. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, family ties were paramount, often dictating political alliances and social obligations. By reminding the leaders of Shechem of his shared lineage, Abimelech seeks to strengthen his claim to leadership through personal connection, a tactic that resonates with the tribal and familial structures prevalent in Israelite society. This also prefigures the New Testament emphasis on spiritual kinship in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

He does not seize power by force at this moment; he first seeks to sway the civic authorities. This shows how influence can precede tyranny. <a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1</a> notes that he "went to his mother&#8217;s brothers in Shechem," positioning himself within existing relationships. Joshua had once renewed covenant with Israel at Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>), reminding us that places of blessing can become settings for rebellion when hearts drift from the Lord.<p>&#8226; The elders&#8217; decision would shape the future of the region&#8212;much like when Israel later asked Samuel for a king (<a href="/1_samuel/8-4.htm">1 Samuel 8:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Their responsibility underscores <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>: "there is no authority except from God," yet human rulers remain accountable for choices.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is it better for you that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you</b><p>Gideon (Jerubbaal) left seventy sons (<a href="/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30</a>). Abimelech frames their potential leadership as chaotic, hinting at rivalry. The irony: Gideon had refused kingship, saying, "The LORD shall rule over you" (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>). Abimelech twists the memory of his father&#8217;s humility into a springboard for his own ambition.<p>&#8226; He plays on fear of fragmentation, much as later kingdoms feared division (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture warns against those who "sow discord among brothers" (<a href="/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or just one man?</b><p>The offer of a single ruler sounds simple and stable, yet it masks self-promotion. Abimelech never mentions God&#8217;s will, only human convenience. This anticipates the era when "every man did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Concentrated authority can bless when God appoints it (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>) or oppress when self-appointed (<a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast with Christ, the true righteous King who "did not come to be served, but to serve" (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Remember that I am your own flesh and blood</b><p>Kinship becomes Abimelech&#8217;s clinching argument. He leverages blood ties over covenant loyalty to the Lord. The appeal works: "their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, 'He is our brother'" (<a href="/judges/9-3.htm">Judges 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture acknowledges family bonds (<a href="/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>) but never elevates them above obedience to God (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>).<p>&#8226; True unity for God&#8217;s people rests on shared faith, not mere genetics (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a> records Abimelech&#8217;s calculated pitch: prompt the leaders of Shechem to prefer one kin-king over Gideon&#8217;s many sons. He manipulates civic influence, stirs fear of fragmented rule, offers the illusion of stability, and seals the deal with family loyalty&#8212;all without consulting the Lord. The verse exposes how easily hearts can trade divine kingship for human convenience, warning believers today to weigh every leadership appeal against God&#8217;s unchanging Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">All the men of Shechem.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the lords </span>(<span class= "ital">Baali</span>)<span class= "ital"> of Shechem. </span>These seem to be the same as "the men" (<span class= "ital">anoshi</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>or "lords (<span class= "ital">Baali</span>) of the tower of Shechem," in <a href="/judges/9-46.htm" title="And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.">Judges 9:46</a>; <a href="/judges/9-49.htm" title="And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.">Judges 9:49</a>. It is by no means impossible that the Canaanites may have still held possession of the fortress, though the Israelites were nominally predominant in the town. At any rate, this particular title of "lords," as applied to the chief people of a town, seems to have been Canaanite rather than Hebrew: the "lords" of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/24-11.htm" title="And you went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.">Joshua 24:11</a>), the "lords" of Gibeah (<a href="/judges/21-5.htm" title="And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.">Judges 21:5</a>), of Keilah (<a href="/1_samuel/23-11.htm" title="Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.">1Samuel 23:11</a>). The term is applied also to the Hittite Uriah (<a href="/2_samuel/11-20.htm" title="And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say to you, Why approached you so near to the city when you did fight? knew you not that they would shoot from the wall?">2Samuel 11:20</a>). What is clear is that, as in so many other towns of Palestine at this epoch (see <a href="/judges/1-32.htm" title="But the Asherites dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.">Judges 1:32</a>, &c), there was a mixed population living side by side in a sort of armed neutrality, though with a mutual dislike, which might at any time break out in tumults. The Israelites held much the same position in many towns as the Normans among the English during the years after the conquest. The Israelites had the upper hand, but they were fewer in numbers, and might easily be overborne at any particular point. It must be borne in mind also that Abimelech, as a Shechemite, would more easily win the adherence of the proud and jealous Ephraimites, who disliked the <span class= "ital">hegemony </span>(see on <a href="/judges/8-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.">Judges 8:1</a>, and comp. <a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1</a>, <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm" title="So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.">1Kings 12:16</a>) which Manasseh had acquired from the victories of Gideon. The plans of Abimelech were deep-laid. In counsel no less than in courage--though both were so grievously misdirected--he shows himself his father's son. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the sons,... which are threescore and ten persons</span>.
