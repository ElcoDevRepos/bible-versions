The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>), while the Amalekites were descendants of Esau (<a href="/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>). The "people of the east" likely refers to other nomadic groups from the Arabian desert. These groups were known for their raids and were a constant threat to Israel during the time of the Judges. This coalition of enemies highlights the severity of the threat against Israel, necessitating divine intervention.<p><b>had settled in the valley</b><br>The valley mentioned is the Valley of Jezreel, a strategic and fertile area in northern Israel. This location was significant for its agricultural productivity, making it a prime target for raiding parties. The valley's geography made it an ideal battleground, as it was accessible and provided ample space for large armies to gather.<p><b>like a swarm of locusts</b><br>The imagery of a "swarm of locusts" conveys the overwhelming number and destructive potential of the enemy forces. Locusts are known for their ability to devastate crops, symbolizing the threat of total destruction. This metaphor emphasizes the dire situation faced by Israel, as the enemy's numbers seemed insurmountable.<p><b>and their camels were as countless as the sand on the seashore</b><br>Camels were a valuable asset in ancient warfare, providing mobility and endurance across desert terrains. The mention of camels being "countless as the sand on the seashore" underscores the vastness of the enemy forces. This hyperbolic expression is reminiscent of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>), contrasting the overwhelming enemy with the promise of God's faithfulness to Israel. The use of camels also indicates the wealth and preparedness of the invading forces, further highlighting the challenge Gideon faced.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe descended from Midian, a son of Abraham by Keturah.

Gideon&#8217;s 300 demonstrate that trust, not tally, wins God&#8217;s battles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the sand on the seashore</b><p>- The phrase signals an innumerable host (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>).<p>- Ironically, that same language describes God&#8217;s covenant promise to Abraham about Israel&#8217;s own descendants&#8212;reminding readers that God keeps His word even when circumstances look opposite.<p>- Facing &#8220;sand-like&#8221; opposition, Gideon experiences the truth of <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>: &#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a> piles up vivid images to underscore how hopeless Israel&#8217;s situation appeared: united enemy tribes, prime valley real estate, locust-like masses, camel cavalry beyond counting, and a host &#8220;as the sand on the seashore.&#8221; Every phrase magnifies the odds so that God&#8217;s deliverance through Gideon&#8217;s 300 cannot be mistaken for luck or human might. The verse invites readers to remember that when opposition feels innumerable and resources scarce, God delights to prove His faithfulness, keeping covenant promises and securing victory for those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Like grasshoppers.</span>--Comp. <a href="/judges/6-5.htm" title="For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.">Judges 6:5</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/22-4.htm" title="And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.
