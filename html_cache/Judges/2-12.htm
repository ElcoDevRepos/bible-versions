This forsaking is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating the cycle of sin, judgment, repentance, and deliverance. The act of forsaking God is seen as a breach of the first commandment, which emphasizes exclusive worship of Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This phrase also underscores the importance of generational faithfulness and the consequences of neglecting to pass down the knowledge and fear of the Lord to subsequent generations.<p><b>who had brought them out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This reference to the Exodus serves as a reminder of God's mighty deliverance and faithfulness. The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing salvation and God's power over oppressive forces. It is frequently recalled throughout the Old Testament as a testament to God's covenantal love and faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>). The mention of Egypt also serves as a contrast between the bondage of the past and the freedom and blessings available in obedience to God.<p><b>and they followed after various gods of the peoples around them</b><br>This phrase indicates the Israelites' adoption of the idolatrous practices of the surrounding nations, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>). The Canaanite gods, such as Baal and Asherah, were often associated with fertility and agricultural success, tempting the Israelites to syncretism. This following after other gods represents a spiritual adultery, as Israel was to be set apart as a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The allure of these gods reflects the ongoing struggle between faithfulness to Yahweh and the temptation to conform to the world.<p><b>They bowed down to them</b><br>Bowing down signifies worship and submission, indicating that the Israelites not only acknowledged these foreign gods but also actively participated in their worship. This act of bowing is a physical manifestation of their spiritual infidelity. In biblical terms, worship is reserved for God alone (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>), and bowing to idols is seen as a direct violation of this principle. This action demonstrates the depth of Israel's apostasy and the seriousness of their sin.<p><b>and provoked the LORD to anger</b><br>The provocation of God's anger is a response to Israel's idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. God's anger is not arbitrary but is a righteous response to sin and rebellion. Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger leads to judgment, but it is also an expression of His desire for His people to return to Him (<a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12-13</a>). This anger is a reminder of God's holiness and the seriousness with which He views idolatry. It also foreshadows the need for a mediator, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who reconciles humanity to God through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were chosen by God to be His people.
