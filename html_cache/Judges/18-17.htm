This reflects the ongoing struggle of the Danites to find a permanent inheritance, as their allotted territory was difficult to conquer (<a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>). The act of spying out the land is reminiscent of the twelve spies sent by Moses in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, highlighting a recurring theme of seeking divine guidance for territorial expansion.<p><b>went inside and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol</b><br>The taking of these religious items indicates a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh, as these objects were associated with idolatry. The graven image and molten idol suggest a violation of the second commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). The ephod, typically a priestly garment, here is linked to idolatrous practices, contrasting with its legitimate use in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6-14</a>). This act of theft and idolatry foreshadows the spiritual decline of Israel, as seen in later books like <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>, where Jeroboam sets up golden calves.<p><b>while the priest stood at the entrance of the gate</b><br>The priest, identified earlier as a Levite, was serving in a compromised religious setting. His passive stance at the gate suggests either complicity or powerlessness. This reflects the broader theme of priestly corruption and failure to uphold the covenant, which is a recurring issue in Israel's history (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>). The gate often symbolizes a place of judgment and decision-making in ancient cities, indicating a moment of moral and spiritual failure.<p><b>with the six hundred armed men</b><br>The presence of six hundred armed men underscores the militaristic approach of the Danites in securing their inheritance. This number signifies a substantial force, reflecting the seriousness of their intent. The use of force to acquire religious objects highlights the blending of military and religious motives, a theme that recurs in Israel's history, such as in the conquest narratives of Joshua. This also prefigures the later militarization of religious conflicts in Israel, as seen in the battles against the Philistines (1 Samuel 4).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_five_spies.htm">The Five Spies</a></b><br>These were the men from the tribe of Dan who initially scouted the land of Laish.
