This act of prayer signifies Manoah's faith and recognition of God's sovereignty. In the context of Judges, prayer often precedes divine intervention or guidance, as seen in the lives of other judges like Gideon and Samson.<p><b>&#8220;Please, O Lord, let the man of God You sent us come to us again</b><br>The "man of God" refers to the angelic messenger who previously appeared to Manoah's wife, announcing the birth of Samson. This request for the messenger to return highlights the importance of divine guidance in understanding God's will. The term "man of God" is used throughout the Old Testament to describe prophets or messengers, such as Moses and Elijah, who convey God's instructions to His people.<p><b>to teach us how to raise the boy who is to be born.&#8221;</b><br>Manoah's desire for instruction on raising the child underscores the significance of Samson's future role as a Nazirite, dedicated to God from birth. This reflects the cultural and religious importance of child-rearing in ancient Israel, where parents were responsible for imparting spiritual and moral values. The request for guidance also parallels the biblical theme of seeking wisdom, as seen in Proverbs, and foreshadows the need for divine wisdom in raising a deliverer for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>Manoah is the father of Samson, a member of the tribe of Dan.
