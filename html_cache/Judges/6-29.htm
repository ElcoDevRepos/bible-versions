The inquiry reflects the community's shock and confusion, as Baal worship was deeply ingrained in their culture. This moment highlights the tension between the worship of Yahweh and the prevalent Canaanite religious practices. The question also underscores the fear of divine retribution from Baal, a common belief among the Israelites who had adopted Canaanite customs.<p><b>&#8220;they said to one another.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase indicates a communal response, suggesting that the act of destroying the altar was significant enough to cause a public stir. This reflects the collective nature of ancient Israelite society, where religious and social matters were often discussed and resolved within the community. The communal dialogue also emphasizes the shared responsibility and concern for maintaining religious practices, whether they were aligned with Yahweh or Canaanite deities.<p><b>&#8220;And after they had investigated thoroughly,&#8221;</b><br>The thorough investigation implies a serious and methodical approach to uncovering the truth. This reflects the legal and social processes of the time, where accusations required evidence and witnesses. The investigation also suggests the gravity of the offense in the eyes of the community, as desecrating a religious site was considered a significant transgression. This process mirrors other biblical instances where thorough investigations were conducted, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-14.htm">Deuteronomy 13:14</a> regarding idolatry.<p><b>&#8220;they were told,&#8221;</b><br>The passive construction indicates that the information was relayed to them, possibly by someone who witnessed the act or had knowledge of it. This suggests the presence of informants or individuals who were aware of Gideon's actions. It also highlights the role of communication and testimony in ancient Israelite society, where word of mouth was a primary means of disseminating information.<p><b>&#8220;Gideon son of Joash did it.&#8221;</b><br>Gideon's identification as the son of Joash is significant, as it ties him to his family and clan, the Abiezrites. This connection is crucial because it situates Gideon within a specific social and familial context, which would have influenced his actions and the community's response. Gideon's act of tearing down the altar is a pivotal moment in his journey as a judge and deliverer of Israel. It marks the beginning of his mission to lead Israel away from idolatry and back to the worship of Yahweh. This act foreshadows Gideon's role as a type of Christ, a deliverer who challenges the status quo and calls people back to true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Their first instinct is to pinpoint responsibility.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that sinful acts&#8212;or, in this case, actions that expose sin&#8212;provoke immediate inquiry (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>; <a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/13-14.htm">Deuteronomy 13:14</a> commands Israel to &#8220;investigate thoroughly&#8221; whenever idolatry is challenged or suspected, so the question arises out of a God-given impulse for accountability.<p>&#8226; That open question also echoes <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>, where the Lord asks, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;&#8212;reminding us that God Himself initiates the search for truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they said to one another</b><p>Notice the communal reaction. No one wants to stand alone; groupthink kicks in.<p>&#8226; Similar peer consultation shows up in <a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a> (&#8220;they said, &#8216;Come, let us build&#8217;&#8221;) and <a href="/acts/4-16.htm">Acts 4:16</a> where the Sanhedrin deliberates, &#8220;What shall we do with these men?&#8221;<p>&#8226; The townspeople&#8217;s unity contrasts sharply with Gideon&#8217;s solitary obedience, underscoring how following the Lord often puts a believer at odds with prevailing opinion (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Their mutual dialogue also hints at fear: if Baal is angry, they all could suffer, so the whole village feels compelled to get answers fast.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And after they had investigated thoroughly</b><p>The Hebrew narrator highlights diligence. Nothing superficial; the community interrogates, compares stories, and inspects evidence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-18.htm">Deuteronomy 19:18</a> instructs judges to &#8220;conduct a thorough investigation.&#8221; Gideon&#8217;s neighbors, perhaps unknowingly, fulfill that legal standard.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/25-2.htm">Proverbs 25:2</a> reminds us, &#8220;It is the glory of kings to search out a matter.&#8221; Even unbelievers can reflect God&#8217;s orderly ways when searching for facts.<p>&#8226; Yet their motive differs from righteous judgment; they are less concerned with truth than with restoring their idol. <a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a> cautions, &#8220;Do not judge by appearances, but judge with righteous judgment.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were told</b><p>Despite secrecy, the facts surface.<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a> warns, &#8220;Be sure your sin will find you out.&#8221; Here, Gideon&#8217;s deed is not sin but obedience&#8212;still, the principle stands: hidden actions become public (<a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a> shows how God exposes deeds at the right moment (&#8220;You are the man!&#8221;). Likewise, God allows Gideon&#8217;s identity to be revealed, moving the story toward a showdown that advances His plan.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a> unveils that God &#8220;made known&#8221; what must soon take place.

The villagers&#8217; question, their collective investigation, and the unveiling of Gideon&#8217;s identity reveal key truths: God provokes accountability, exposes hidden deeds, and positions His servants for greater battles.
