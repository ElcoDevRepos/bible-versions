It suggests a period of relative peace or stability before the conflict with the Ammonites arises. This is a common narrative technique in the Book of Judges, where cycles of peace and conflict are depicted. The time lapse also allows for the development of new leaders and circumstances in Israel.<p><b>when the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, through his younger daughter (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>). They were a neighboring nation east of the Jordan River, often in conflict with Israel. The Ammonites worshiped the god Milcom or Molech, and their practices were often in direct opposition to the worship of Yahweh. Their relationship with Israel was marked by hostility and warfare, as seen in various biblical accounts.<p><b>fought against Israel</b><br>This conflict is part of the recurring theme in Judges where Israel faces oppression due to their disobedience to God. The Ammonites' aggression can be seen as a divine instrument of judgment against Israel's idolatry and sin. Historically, the Ammonites were known for their military campaigns and territorial ambitions. This battle sets the stage for the rise of Jephthah, a judge who would deliver Israel from their oppression. The conflict also highlights the need for a deliverer, a theme that points forward to the ultimate deliverer, Jesus Christ, who would save His people from their sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A group of people descended from Lot, Abraham's nephew.
