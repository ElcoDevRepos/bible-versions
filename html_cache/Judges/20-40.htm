The column of smoke served as a prearranged signal for the Israelite forces. In ancient warfare, such signals were crucial for coordinating attacks, especially in the absence of modern communication methods. The use of smoke as a signal is also seen in other biblical contexts, such as the pillar of cloud that guided the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). This imagery of smoke rising can symbolize divine intervention or judgment, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>).<p><b>the Benjamites looked behind them</b><br>The Benjamites, engaged in battle, were caught off guard by the sudden realization of their city's destruction. This moment of looking back is reminiscent of Lot's wife looking back at Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26</a>), symbolizing a moment of realization and impending doom. The Benjamites' focus on the battlefront left them vulnerable to the strategic maneuver of the Israelites, highlighting the importance of vigilance and awareness in spiritual warfare.<p><b>and saw the whole city going up in smoke</b><br>The complete destruction of the city signifies total defeat and judgment. In the context of Judges, this event is a consequence of the moral and social decay within the tribe of Benjamin, particularly the atrocity committed in Gibeah (Judges 19). The imagery of a city going up in smoke is a powerful representation of divine judgment, similar to the destruction of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-24.htm">Joshua 6:24</a>) and the prophesied fall of Babylon (<a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9</a>). This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and the justice of God. The destruction also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and purification that will come through Christ, who will establish a new and holy city (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, known for their skilled warriors.
