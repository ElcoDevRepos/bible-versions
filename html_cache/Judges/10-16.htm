Throughout the Book of Judges, Israel repeatedly falls into idolatry, worshiping the gods of the surrounding nations such as Baal and Ashtoreth. This act of putting away foreign gods signifies repentance and a return to monotheistic worship. The removal of idols is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). It reflects a physical and spiritual cleansing, aligning with the covenant relationship established at Sinai.<p><b>and served the LORD</b><br>Serving the LORD implies a renewed commitment to the covenant relationship with Yahweh. This service is not merely ritualistic but involves obedience to God's laws and commands. The Hebrew word for "serve" (&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;, avad) can also mean "to work" or "to worship," indicating a holistic devotion. This phrase echoes the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which calls for loving and serving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. It also foreshadows the New Testament call to serve God through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>and He could no longer bear the misery of Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights God's compassion and mercy. Despite Israel's repeated disobedience, God's love and covenant faithfulness lead Him to respond to their suffering. The term "misery" refers to the consequences of their sin, often manifesting as oppression by foreign powers. God's response is consistent with His character as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where He is portrayed as compassionate and gracious. This divine compassion prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who bears humanity's misery and sin on the cross (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who repeatedly fell into idolatry and sin, leading to their oppression by foreign nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_gods.htm">Foreign gods</a></b><br>The idols and deities worshiped by the surrounding nations, which the Israelites adopted, leading them away from the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who desires exclusive worship and is compassionate towards His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppression.htm">Oppression</a></b><br>The suffering and subjugation experienced by the Israelites as a consequence of their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>The act of turning away from sin and returning to God, demonstrated by the Israelites putting away foreign gods.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_repentance.htm">The Necessity of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves a decisive turning away from sin and idolatry, as seen in the Israelites' actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassion.htm">God's Compassion</a></b><br>Despite Israel's repeated failures, God's compassion is evident as He responds to their misery and repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_worship.htm">Exclusive Worship</a></b><br>God demands exclusive worship, and idolatry in any form is a serious offense against Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The Israelites' suffering under foreign oppression serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_restoration.htm">Hope for Restoration</a></b><br>No matter how far we stray, there is always hope for restoration when we genuinely return to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_10_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 10:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_discard_modern_foreign_gods.htm">How can we "put away the foreign gods" in our modern lives today?

They did not simply regret their sin; they took decisive action by removing the idols that had crept into daily life. Joshua had called for the same cleansing moments before his death&#8212;&#8220;Now therefore&#8230; remove the foreign gods among you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-23.htm">Joshua 24:23</a>). Samuel would echo it a generation later (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3&#8211;4</a>). Genuine repentance always involves:<p>&#8226;Identifying what has replaced the Lord in our affections<p>&#8226;Physically and relationally distancing ourselves from it<p>&#8226;Refusing to keep even a token remnant (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2&#8211;3</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and served the LORD</b><p>Putting away idols created space for positive obedience: &#8220;Fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and faithfulness&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>). Service here is wholehearted devotion&#8212;worship, obedience, and dependence wrapped together (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>). Lip service would not suffice; Israel shifted their time, energy, and allegiance back to the covenant God. Notice the order: removal, then service. We cannot cling to Baal with one hand and lift holy hands to Yahweh with the other (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). Practical markers of true service include:<p>&#8226;Regular, sincere worship (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6&#8211;7</a>)<p>&#8226;Obedience to revealed commands (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>)<p>&#8226;Trust in God&#8217;s sufficiency rather than human schemes (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He could no longer bear the misery of Israel</b><p>Scripture paints God as both just and compassionate. While His holiness demands judgment (<a href="/judges/10-13.htm">Judges 10:13&#8211;14</a>), His heart aches when His people suffer under the consequences of sin. &#8220;The LORD was moved to pity by their groaning&#8221; in an earlier cycle (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>), and He says in another era, &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction of My people&#8230; and I have come down to deliver them&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7&#8211;8</a>). Here, their genuine repentance touches Him so deeply that He &#8220;could no longer bear&#8221; their distress. This phrase does not hint at weakness but highlights divine mercy:<p>&#8226;God feels for His covenant people (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>).<p>&#8226;He acts when repentance is real (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p>&#8226;His deliverance soon arrives through Jephthah (<a href="/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1, 32</a>&#8211;33).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/10-16.htm">Judges 10:16</a> reveals a timeless pattern: sincere repentance involves removing idols, returning to wholehearted service, and experiencing God&#8217;s compassionate response.
