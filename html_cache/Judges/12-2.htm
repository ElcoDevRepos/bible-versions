This reflects the common biblical theme of leaders being questioned or challenged, similar to Moses and David.<p><b>My people and I had a serious conflict with the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel. This conflict highlights the ongoing struggle for land and dominance in the region. The phrase underscores the collective struggle of Jephthah and his people, emphasizing unity in facing external threats.<p><b>and when I called, you did not save me out of their hands</b><br>Jephthah's call for help was likely directed towards the Ephraimites, who were known for their pride and reluctance to assist other tribes unless it benefited them. This reflects the tribal tensions within Israel, as seen in other instances like the conflict between the tribes of Benjamin and the rest of Israel. The failure to respond to Jephthah's call can be seen as a lack of unity and support among the Israelites, which is a recurring issue throughout the book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and military prowess.
