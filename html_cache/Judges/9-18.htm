Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, was a judge of Israel who delivered the Israelites from Midianite oppression. The "house" refers to his family lineage, which was expected to be respected and honored. The act of rising up against them signifies a grave violation of familial and societal norms in ancient Israel, where family loyalty was paramount.<p><b>and killed his seventy sons on a single stone</b><br>The murder of Gideon's seventy sons is a brutal act of fratricide, emphasizing the extent of Abimelech's ambition and ruthlessness. The "single stone" suggests a methodical and public execution, possibly as a sacrificial act or to make a statement of power. This event echoes the violence and chaos prevalent in the period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). It also foreshadows the instability and moral decline that would lead to the demand for a monarchy in Israel.<p><b>and you have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king</b><br>Abimelech's rise to power is marked by illegitimacy, as he is the son of Gideon's concubine, not a legitimate wife. This detail underscores the tension between legitimate heirs and those of lower status, reflecting the complex social hierarchies of the time. Abimelech's kingship is not divinely appointed, contrasting with the later anointing of kings like Saul and David, and it serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of self-appointed leadership.<p><b>over the leaders of Shechem</b><br>Shechem was a significant city in the tribal confederation of Israel, with historical and religious importance dating back to the time of Abraham. The leaders of Shechem's decision to support Abimelech indicates political motivations and alliances that were common in the tribal period. This alliance is strategic, as Shechem was a central location, but it also reveals the opportunistic nature of political power plays in ancient Israel.<p><b>because he is your brother&#8212;</b><br>The appeal to kinship is a powerful motivator in the ancient Near East, where family ties often dictated political alliances and social obligations. The leaders of Shechem support Abimelech not out of loyalty to Gideon's legacy but because of their shared familial connection. This highlights the theme of loyalty and betrayal that runs throughout the narrative, as well as the potential for familial relationships to be manipulated for personal gain.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and his concubine from Shechem.
