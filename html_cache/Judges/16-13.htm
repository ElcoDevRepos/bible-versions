This reflects the broader theme of betrayal and manipulation, as Delilah is being used by the Philistine rulers to discover the secret of Samson's strength. The tension between truth and deception is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in stories like Jacob and Esau or Ananias and Sapphira.<p><b>Tell me how you can be tied up.&#8221;</b><br>Delilah's persistence in questioning Samson underscores her determination to fulfill the Philistine leaders' request. This reflects the cultural and historical context of the Philistines' oppression of Israel, as they sought to neutralize Samson, who was a significant threat to their dominance. The request to "tie up" Samson symbolizes the Philistines' desire to control and subdue the power of God working through him.<p><b>He told her, &#8220;If you weave the seven braids of my head into the web of a loom</b><br>Samson's response is another layer of deception, yet it brings him closer to revealing the truth. The mention of "seven braids" is significant, as the number seven often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible. The act of weaving into a loom may symbolize entanglement or being caught in a trap, foreshadowing Samson's eventual downfall due to his entanglement with Delilah.<p><b>and tighten it with a pin,</b><br>The imagery of tightening with a pin suggests a false sense of security or control. In biblical times, looms were common tools, and the pin would secure the woven fabric. This detail emphasizes the fragility of Samson's deception and the ease with which his strength could be compromised if he were to reveal the truth.<p><b>I will become as weak as any other man.&#8221;</b><br>Samson's statement foreshadows his eventual vulnerability and loss of strength. This phrase highlights the conditional nature of his power, which is tied to his Nazirite vow and ultimately to his relationship with God. The idea of becoming "as weak as any other man" serves as a reminder of human frailty and the consequences of straying from divine commandments. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though possessing divine strength, took on human weakness to fulfill God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was linked to his Nazirite vow and uncut hair.

She is no mere background figure; her words drive the action. <a href="/judges/16-4.htm">Judges 16:4&#8211;6</a> has already revealed her alliance with the Philistine rulers, so every syllable here is loaded with betrayal. This mirrors other moments in Scripture where a close companion turns into an adversary&#8212;think of Judas&#8217;s approach to Jesus in <a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14&#8211;16</a>&#8212;and reminds us how sin often masquerades behind familiar faces. Delilah&#8217;s initiative shows:<p>&#8226; Deliberate persistence: three previous attempts (<a href="/judges/16-6.htm">Judges 16:6&#8211;12</a>) failed, yet she presses on.<p>&#8226; Calculated intimacy: she speaks &#8220;to Samson,&#8221; face-to-face, using relationship as leverage (<a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>).<p>&#8226; A test of Samson&#8217;s discernment: will he heed repeated warning signs or continue flirting with danger (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>)?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You have mocked me and lied to me all along!&#8221;</b><p>Delilah flips reality on its head. She, the deceiver, accuses Samson of deceit. This is textbook manipulation, echoing Satan&#8217;s tactic in <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1&#8211;5</a>&#8212;injecting guilt to draw a person further into compromise. Notice how:<p>&#8226; Emotional language (&#8220;mocked&#8230;lied&#8221;) aims at Samson&#8217;s heart rather than his reason (<a href="/proverbs/7-21.htm">Proverbs 7:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The charge is partly true: Samson has indeed misled her, yet his motive is self-preservation, not treachery.<p>&#8226; A compromised believer may find truth mixed with error, creating confusion (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Tell me how you can be tied up.&#8221;</b><p>The demand is blunt.

His Nazirite hair (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>) is now part of the story, even if not yet the full disclosure. Key observations:<p>&#8226; Flirtation with consecrated things: Samson treats his holy vow lightly (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Symbolic entanglement: weaving hair into a loom pictures how sin entraps the believer (<a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Self-reliance on display: Samson assumes he can escape again, forgetting that strength is from the Lord (<a href="/judges/15-18.htm">Judges 15:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/16-13.htm">Judges 16:13</a> traces a perilous dialogue where Delilah&#8217;s persistence meets Samson&#8217;s careless heart. Each phrase uncovers manipulation, compromise, and the gradual erosion of a God-given calling. The verse warns that repeated flirting with temptation numbs spiritual senses, and that holy commitments lose power when treated as playthings. Deliverance lies in swift obedience and trust in the One who bestows our strength, never in our own cleverness or resilience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</span>--The illustrious and "sunny locks of the Nazarite" did not, as Milton imagines, "lie waving and curling about his god-like shoulders," but were plaited into seven locks. The word for "locks"--<span class= "ital">machelephoth</span>--occurs here only. The LXX. render it "curls<span class= "ital">" </span>(<span class= "ital">bostruchous</span>) and <span class= "ital">seiras, </span>which appears to mean "plaits," like the Greek <span class= "ital">plokamous. </span>The word for "web" is a technical word, and perhaps means warp. The LXX. and the Vulg. add, "and drive them with the peg into the wall," which is implied in the next verse. With almost incredible levity and folly, Samson here goes to the very verge of the true secret, and suffers his sacred hair to be woven in a harlot's loom.
