This phrase indicates a mobilization for war, a common occurrence in the period of the Judges when Israel faced frequent threats from neighboring nations. The Ammonites' hostility can be traced back to territorial disputes and historical enmity (<a href="/judges/11-4.htm">Judges 11:4-5</a>). This mobilization reflects the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance seen throughout the Book of Judges.<p><b>and camped in Gilead</b><br>Gilead was a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain. It was part of the territory allotted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The Ammonites' encampment here signifies a direct threat to these tribes. Gilead's strategic location made it a frequent battleground, and its mention highlights the geographical and tribal tensions of the time.<p><b>and the Israelites assembled</b><br>The assembly of the Israelites indicates a response to the Ammonite threat. This gathering was likely a call to arms for the tribes affected by the Ammonite aggression. It reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where tribes would unite against common enemies. This assembly is a precursor to the leadership of Jephthah, who would later deliver Israel from the Ammonites (<a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11:1-11</a>).<p><b>and camped at Mizpah</b><br>Mizpah, meaning "watchtower," was a significant site for gatherings and covenant renewals in Israel's history. Its location is debated, but it served as a rallying point for the Israelites. Mizpah's role as a place of assembly is seen in other biblical accounts, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-6</a>, where Samuel gathered Israel for repentance and renewal.

The timing underscores how foreign oppression often becomes God&#8217;s instrument of chastening when Israel lapses into idolatry (<a href="/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40&#8211;42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and camped in Gilead</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and camped in Gilead&#8221; (<a href="/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>b).<p>&#8226; Gilead, east of the Jordan, belongs to the tribes of Gad and half-Manasseh (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1, 33</a>).

But a new spirit was aroused among the Israelites. By whatever channel the bitter reproach in vers. 11-14 had been convey. ed to them, probably by the same channel, whether angel, or prophet, or high priest, had an answer of peace come to them on their repentance, and so they were roused and encouraged to resistance. As a first step, they <span class="cmt_word">encamped in Mizpeh</span> (see <a href="/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11, 29, 34</a>). Mizpeh, or Mizpah of Gilead, is probably the same as Mizpah in Gilead where Laban and Jacob parted (<a href="/genesis/31-25.htm">Genesis 31:25, 49</a>); as Ramoth-Mizpeh (<a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), called simply <span class="accented">Ramoth in Gilead</span> (<a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-80.htm">1 Chronicles 6:80</a>); and as the place well known in later Israelite history as <span class="accented">Ramoth-Gilead</span> (<a href="/1_kings/4-13.htm">1 Kings 4:13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-3.htm">1 Kings 22:3, 6</a>), situated in the tribe of Gad, and a strong place of much importance.
