The Levite's actions follow the horrific events in Gibeah, where the concubine was abused and died. This reflects the moral decay and lawlessness during the time of the Judges, a period characterized by the repeated phrase, "In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>cut her into pieces</b><br>The act of dismembering the concubine's body was a shocking and gruesome method to convey the gravity of the crime committed. This act was intended to provoke a national response. It echoes the ancient Near Eastern practice of sending body parts as a call to arms or to highlight a severe injustice, similar to the story of Saul and the oxen in <a href="/1_samuel/11-7.htm">1 Samuel 11:7</a>.<p><b>and sent her throughout the land of Israel&#8217;s inheritance</b><br>The distribution of the body parts to the tribes of Israel was a call for unity and action against the atrocity committed in Gibeah. The "land of Israel's inheritance" refers to the territories allotted to the twelve tribes, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the nation to uphold justice and righteousness.<p><b>because they had committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel</b><br>The "lewd and disgraceful act" refers to the gang rape and murder of the concubine by the men of Gibeah, a crime that violated the covenantal laws of hospitality and protection. This phrase underscores the severity of the sin and the need for communal accountability. It also highlights the moral decline in Israel, drawing parallels to the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19), and serves as a warning against turning away from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite's actions set off a chain of events leading to civil war.
