Arumah is believed to be a location near Shechem, though its exact site is not definitively identified today. This phrase indicates a strategic retreat or regrouping by Abimelech, suggesting a temporary withdrawal to a place of safety or control. The choice of Arumah may reflect Abimelech's need to consolidate power or plan his next move. This action is part of the larger narrative of Abimelech's violent and tumultuous reign, which is marked by treachery and conflict, reflecting the chaotic period of the Judges when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem</b><br>Zebul was the ruler of the city of Shechem under Abimelech's authority. Gaal, a newcomer, had incited the people of Shechem to rebel against Abimelech, exploiting the existing discontent. Zebul's actions in driving out Gaal and his brothers demonstrate his loyalty to Abimelech and his role in maintaining Abimelech's control over Shechem. This expulsion is a pivotal moment in the power struggle, highlighting the political intrigue and shifting alliances characteristic of the era. The conflict between Gaal and Zebul can be seen as a microcosm of the larger instability in Israel during the time of the Judges, where leadership was often contested and authority was fragile. This event also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Abimelech, as internal strife and betrayal continue to plague his rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), who declared himself king over Shechem and surrounding areas.
