The Israelites repeatedly fall into idolatry and disobedience, which is considered "evil" in God's eyes. This cycle reflects the human tendency to stray from God's commandments, emphasizing the need for continual faithfulness. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and His moral standard, which the Israelites are failing to uphold.<p><b>They served the Baals, the Ashtoreths,</b><br>The Baals and Ashtoreths were Canaanite deities, representing fertility and nature. Baal was often associated with storms and agriculture, while Ashtoreth was linked to love and war. The Israelites' worship of these gods indicates a syncretism with Canaanite religion, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This idolatry reflects a departure from monotheism and a breach of the covenant relationship with Yahweh. The worship of these deities often involved immoral practices, further illustrating the depth of Israel's apostasy.<p><b>the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab,</b><br>Aram, Sidon, and Moab were neighboring regions with their own pantheons. Aram's gods included Hadad, a storm god similar to Baal. Sidon, a Phoenician city, worshiped deities like Eshmun and Melqart. Moab's chief god was Chemosh. The Israelites' adoption of these foreign gods signifies a cultural and spiritual assimilation that led them away from their unique identity as God's chosen people. This syncretism is a direct violation of the first commandment and demonstrates the influence of surrounding nations on Israel.<p><b>and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines.</b><br>The Ammonites worshiped Milcom or Molech, often associated with child sacrifice, a practice detestable to God (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). The Philistines worshiped Dagon, a god of grain and agriculture. The inclusion of these gods in Israel's worship further illustrates the extent of their spiritual decline. The Philistines and Ammonites were frequent adversaries of Israel, and their gods represented the political and military threats these nations posed. This idolatry not only led to spiritual corruption but also to political and social instability.<p><b>Thus they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him.</b><br>Forsaking the LORD implies a deliberate abandonment of their covenant relationship with God. This phrase indicates a complete turning away from Yahweh, not just a passive neglect. The Israelites' failure to serve God is a rejection of their identity and purpose as His people. This apostasy leads to divine judgment, as God allows their enemies to oppress them, fulfilling the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.

After every deliverance recorded earlier in Judges (2:16-19; 3:9-11, 3:15-30; 4:4-24; 6:7-10), Israel drifts back into sin. The phrase &#8220;in the sight of the LORD&#8221; reminds us that nothing escapes His notice (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). Rebellion is never merely horizontal&#8212;hurting others or society&#8212;but vertical, an affront to God Himself (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>).<p>Key take-aways:<p>&#8226; Sin repeats when repentance is shallow (<a href="/judges/2-19.htm">Judges 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s perspective, not public opinion, determines right and wrong (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Grace does not cancel accountability (<a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They served the Baals, the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines</b><p>Idolatry is more than bowing to statues; it is misplaced trust (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).
