Penuel, also known as Peniel, is historically significant as the place where Jacob wrestled with God (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). This location is a reminder of divine encounters and the transformation of character. Gideon's interaction with the men of Penuel reflects a moment of tension, as they refused to support him in his pursuit of the Midianite kings. This refusal highlights the lack of unity among the Israelite tribes during the period of the judges, a time marked by decentralized leadership and frequent disobedience to God.<p><b>&#8220;When I return in triumph</b><br>Gideon's confidence in his return "in triumph" indicates his faith in God's promise of victory over the Midianites. This assurance can be seen as a reflection of the divine empowerment he received earlier in his calling (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14-16</a>). The phrase underscores the theme of God's deliverance through chosen leaders, despite overwhelming odds. Gideon's statement also foreshadows the fulfillment of God's plan, as he is assured of success not by his own strength but by divine intervention.<p><b>I will tear down this tower!&#8221;</b><br>The tower of Penuel was likely a fortified structure, symbolizing the city's strength and security. In ancient Near Eastern culture, towers were often built for defense and as watchpoints. Gideon's threat to tear down the tower signifies a judgment against the city's refusal to aid him, representing a broader theme of divine retribution against those who oppose God's chosen deliverers. This act of tearing down the tower can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over all earthly powers and principalities, as He establishes His kingdom. The destruction of the tower serves as a warning to those who place their trust in human strength rather than in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Earlier the Lord had promised, &#8220;I will deliver Midian into your hands&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>).<p>&#8211; His confidence rests on God&#8217;s unbreakable word; he looks forward to victory before the final pursuit is completed (<a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32-34</a> highlights such faith).<p>&#8211; This assurance mirrors David&#8217;s before Goliath: &#8220;The battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>&#8211; For us it illustrates living faith that counts God&#8217;s promises as already fulfilled (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20-21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will tear down this tower!</b><p>&#8211; The tower symbolized Penuel&#8217;s self-reliance and security. By threatening it, Gideon targeted the heart-issue of misplaced trust (<a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10-11</a>).<p>&#8211; Towers often served as refuges in Israel&#8217;s cities (<a href="/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46-52</a>). Destroying one signified stripping away false protection when people rejected God&#8217;s shelter (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Gideon&#8217;s delayed judgment gave Penuel time to repent, underscoring God&#8217;s patience yet sure justice (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>).<p>&#8211; His action would fulfill Mosaic law requiring punishment of covenant infidelity and rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/8-9.htm">Judges 8:9</a> shows Gideon responding firmly to faithless Israelites. Penuel&#8217;s refusal to aid God&#8217;s servant exposed a heart of fear and pride. Confident in the Lord&#8217;s promise, Gideon foretold victory and pledged to dismantle the town&#8217;s symbol of self-made security.
