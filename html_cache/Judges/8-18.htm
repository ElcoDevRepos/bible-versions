Gideon already knows the answer (<a href="/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>), but he elicits a confession&#8212;similar to how Nathan drew one from David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>)&#8212;so that the culprits stand condemned by their own words (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-37.htm">Matthew 12:37</a>).<p>Key observations:<p>&#8226; Gideon&#8217;s focus is not on spoils or revenge but on righteousness.<p>&#8226; Justice in Israel requires eyewitness testimony or an admission, both now satisfied.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Men like you,&#8221; they answered</b><p>The Midianite kings admit the slain men resembled Gideon himself.

In <span class= "ital">Iliad, iii.</span> 170, Priam says: "One so fair I never saw with my eyes, nor so stately, for he is like a king" (<span class= "greekheb">??????? ??? ????? ?</span>?<span class= "greekheb">????</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What manner of men</span>, etc. An incident not before related is here brought to light, viz., that on some unknown occasion, possibly as soon as the rising of the Israelites under Gideon became known, or when, as related in <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>, they had sought to hide themselves in Mount Tabor, but had been caught, Zebah and Zalmunna had put to death Gideon's brothers. We may observe in passing how characteristic this is of a true narrative in which every. thing that happened cannot possibly be related (see <a href="/judges/10-11.htm">Judges 10:11, 12</a>, note). The word here rendered <span class="accented">what manner of</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. of what</span> sort, means, in every other place in which it occurs, where? and the sense <span class="accented">of what sort is</span> only inferred from the answer, <span class="accented">As thou art</span>, <span class="accented">so were they.</span> But it is not safe thus to change the universal meaning of a common word. It is better to take the words of Gideon, <span class="accented">Where are the men whom ye slew</span> at Tabor? as an upbraiding of them for the murder of his brethren, and a threat that where they were their murderers would soon be. The answer of Zebah and Zalmunna, which is not given in its entirety, was no doubt intended to be soothing and deprecatory of Gideon's wrath. They pleaded the necessity they were under in self-defence to slay them; they were men of such royal stature and prowess that their own lives would have been in danger had they spared them. But Gideon turned a deaf ear to their plea. He must avenge the death of his own brothers, his own mother's sons. He would have spared them as prisoners of war (<a href="/2_kings/6-22.htm">2 Kings 6:22</a>), but he must do his part as <span class="accented">goel</span> or <span class="accented">avenger</span> (<a href="/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Observe the stress laid on their being not merely his father's sons by another wife, but his own mother's sons, a much more tender relation (cf. Psalm 50:0). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Next, [Gideon] asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
