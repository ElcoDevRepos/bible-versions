The act of cutting branches is reminiscent of military tactics used in ancient warfare, where soldiers would use available resources to achieve strategic goals. Abimelech, a son of Gideon, had declared himself king and was known for his ruthless ambition. This event occurs after Abimelech's violent rise to power, which included the murder of his seventy brothers. The followers' actions reflect the influence and control Abimelech had over his men, as well as the desperation and fear that drove them to comply with his orders.<p><b>Then they piled the branches against the inner chamber and set it on fire above them,</b><br>The piling of branches against the inner chamber indicates a siege tactic aimed at destroying the stronghold of the tower of Shechem. This method of warfare was brutal and effective, designed to smoke out or burn those inside. The inner chamber likely served as a place of refuge for the people of Shechem, who had sought safety from Abimelech's wrath. The act of setting the chamber on fire is a testament to the destructive nature of Abimelech's reign and his willingness to annihilate those who opposed him. This event foreshadows the eventual downfall of Abimelech, as his violent actions lead to his own demise, fulfilling the principle of reaping what one sows.<p><b>killing everyone in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women.</b><br>The mass killing of about a thousand men and women in the tower of Shechem underscores the severity of Abimelech's tyranny and the tragic loss of life resulting from his quest for power. This massacre is a stark reminder of the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God, as they had turned away from His commandments and sought leadership from a man like Abimelech. The destruction of Shechem, a city with historical significance as a center of covenant renewal (Joshua 24), symbolizes the spiritual and moral decay of the nation. This event also serves as a warning against the dangers of ungodly leadership and the importance of seeking God's guidance in choosing leaders. The narrative of Abimelech's reign and its violent end is a sobering reflection on the cyclical nature of sin and judgment in the book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), who declared himself king over Shechem and led a violent campaign to consolidate power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_shechem.htm">Men of Shechem</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Shechem who initially supported Abimelech but later turned against him due to his tyrannical rule.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tower_of_shechem.htm">Tower of Shechem</a></b><br>A fortified structure where the people of Shechem sought refuge from Abimelech's attack.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stronghold.htm">The Stronghold</a></b><br>The place where the people of Shechem gathered for protection, ultimately becoming the site of their demise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Abimelech's men cut branches, piled them against the stronghold, and set it on fire, killing about a thousand men and women inside.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_ambition_and_pride.htm">The Dangers of Ambition and Pride</a></b><br>Abimelech's account warns against unchecked ambition and pride, which can lead to destructive outcomes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_betrayal.htm">The Consequences of Betrayal</a></b><br>The people of Shechem's betrayal of Abimelech and vice versa illustrate the destructive cycle of betrayal and mistrust.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_false_security.htm">The Illusion of False Security</a></b><br>The Tower of Shechem represents false security;

The prior verse shows Abimelech himself cutting a branch from a tree (<a href="/judges/9-48.htm">Judges 9:48</a>), giving visual instructions rather than a spoken command. The troops immediately imitate him, a reminder that people often follow the visible example of a leader&#8212;whether for good (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>) or for harm (<a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Their unified action signals full buy-in to Abimelech&#8217;s ruthless strategy. Earlier, Jotham had warned that &#8220;fire&#8221; would come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem (<a href="/judges/9-20.htm">Judges 9:20</a>). The men are now unwitting agents in fulfilling that prophetic curse.<p>&#8226; By &#8220;each man&#8221; taking part, Scripture underscores collective responsibility; no one in Abimelech&#8217;s force can claim innocence (compare <a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a> with verse 11 where &#8220;Israel has sinned&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they piled the branches against the inner chamber</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;inner chamber&#8221; (or stronghold) sat inside the tower of Shechem. Branches stacked around it turn the sturdy refuge into a tinderbox.<p>&#8226; The text echoes Abimelech&#8217;s earlier destruction of the tower at Ophrah (<a href="/judges/9-5.htm">Judges 9:5</a>)&#8212;violence has a way of escalating when left unchecked (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; What looks like tactical brilliance also exposes the hardness of Abimelech&#8217;s heart; he is willing to weaponize nature itself to achieve his ends, contrasting sharply with God&#8217;s use of fire to purify (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>) rather than to annihilate indiscriminately.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set it on fire above them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Fire&#8221; now literally descends on Shechem. Abimelech becomes the agent of the very judgment Jotham predicted, showing God&#8217;s sovereign ability to turn human wickedness against itself (<a href="/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This act parallels earlier judgments by fire, such as Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) and Elijah&#8217;s confrontation with the king&#8217;s soldiers (<a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10-12</a>), underscoring that fire often symbolizes divine judgment&#8212;even when delivered through human hands.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;above them&#8221; hints that the victims had no escape; the flames started higher up, driving smoke and heat downward, a grim picture of inescapable judgment (<a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>killing everyone in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women</b><p>&#8226; Scripture gives an approximate number&#8212;&#8220;about a thousand&#8221;&#8212;to convey the scale of the atrocity. Both &#8220;men and women&#8221; are mentioned to emphasize total destruction, much like in the flood narrative (<a href="/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; This is a tragic reversal of refuge: a tower meant for safety becomes a furnace of death (compare <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>, where &#8220;The name of the LORD is a strong tower&#8221;). Any stronghold outside God quickly turns into a trap (<a href="/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The slaughter fulfills the curse earlier pronounced by Jotham: &#8220;Let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem&#8221; (<a href="/judges/9-20.htm">Judges 9:20</a>). God&#8217;s Word proves unfailingly accurate, even when its fulfillment is frightening (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-49.htm">Judges 9:49</a> records Abimelech&#8217;s troops copying his action of cutting branches, piling them against Shechem&#8217;s inner tower, igniting the heap, and burning alive roughly a thousand people. The verse shows:<p>&#8226; the power&#8212;and peril&#8212;of following a godless leader;<p>&#8226; the literal fulfillment of Jotham&#8217;s prophetic curse;<p>&#8226; the sobering truth that human schemes can become instruments of divine judgment;<p>&#8226; the inescapability of accountability when a community joins in evil.<p>Taken at face value, the passage warns that any refuge apart from the Lord is no refuge at all and underscores that Scripture&#8217;s prophecies come to pass exactly as spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set the hold on fire</span> - thus literally fulfilling Jotham's curse in vers. 15 and 20.
