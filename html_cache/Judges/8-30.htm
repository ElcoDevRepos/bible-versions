This detail highlights the patriarchal nature of the society, where lineage and inheritance were crucial. The number seventy is symbolic in the Bible, often representing completeness or perfection, as seen in the seventy elders of Israel (<a href="/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>) and the seventy nations listed in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. Gideon's many sons also foreshadow the internal strife and power struggles that will arise after his death, as seen in the subsequent chapters of Judges.<p><b>since he had many wives</b><br>Polygamy was a common practice among leaders and wealthy individuals in the ancient Near East, often used to form alliances and increase one's influence. While not explicitly condemned in the Old Testament, polygamy often led to familial discord and complications, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Abraham, Jacob, and David. Gideon's many wives reflect the cultural norms of the time but also set the stage for future conflict, particularly with his son Abimelech, who would later kill his brothers to seize power (Judges 9). This practice contrasts with the monogamous ideal presented in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> and affirmed by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>, highlighting the tension between cultural practices and divine intention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, also known as Jerubbaal, who led the Israelites to victory over the Midianites.

Gideon&#8217;s family size reflects divine provision, but his polygamy seeds discord that devastates the next generation. The passage calls readers to prize obedience after triumph and to uphold God&#8217;s standard of one man and one woman, knowing that faithfulness safeguards both household and nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Threescore and ten sons.</span>--According to Oriental fashion, no account is taken of his daughters.<p><span class= "bld">He had many wives.</span>--It is clear that Gideon was a king in all but name.

Q. Cincinnatus, in the Roman legend, returned to his plough after his victory over the Volsciana He was judge over Israel for forty years, with a household and a harem like a great prince, living in his paternal city, with the ephod set up there, himself the centre round which the powers of Church and State gathered; directing the affairs of his country, both civil and ecclesiastical, with eminent success, so that the country was at peace for forty years (a peace as long as that which followed the battle of Water-leo], and the detestable Baal-worship was effectually suppressed. And having lived in wealth and honour, he died in peace, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father at Ophrah in a good old age. He remains to us as one of the most remarkable characters of the Old Testament, not indeed without faults and blemishes, and not wholly unspoiled by prosperity, but still a great man, and an eminent servant of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Gideon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1490;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7713;i&#7695;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1439.htm">Strong's 1439: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gideon -- a judge of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">seventy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7657.htm">Strong's 7657: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seventy (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his own,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1510;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">since</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1445;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wives.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/8-30.htm">OT History: Judges 8:30 Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his (Jd Judg.
