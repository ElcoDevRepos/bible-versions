In the context of Judges, Abimelech was a son of Gideon who sought power through manipulation and violence. The use of covert messengers suggests a climate of fear and betrayal, common in the period of the Judges when Israel had no king and everyone did what was right in their own eyes (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). This reflects the broader theme of the book, where leadership is often flawed and self-serving.<p><b>Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem</b><br>Shechem was a significant city in Israel's history, located in the hill country of Ephraim. It was a place of covenant renewal (Joshua 24) and had deep historical and religious significance. Gaal son of Ebed represents a challenge to Abimelech's authority, as he and his brothers are outsiders coming into a city with a rich heritage. This situation echoes the recurring biblical theme of outsiders challenging established power, reminiscent of David's rise against Saul.<p><b>and are stirring up the city against you</b><br>The phrase indicates a brewing rebellion, with Gaal inciting the people of Shechem against Abimelech. This reflects the instability and factionalism of the time, where loyalty was often fluid and dependent on immediate benefits. The stirring up of the city can be seen as a precursor to civil unrest, a common occurrence in the era of the Judges. This internal conflict within Israel foreshadows the later divisions that would lead to the split of the kingdom after Solomon's reign. Theologically, it underscores the consequences of abandoning God's covenant, leading to chaos and strife.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), who declared himself king over Shechem after the death of his father.
