This act of coming down suggests they traveled from a higher elevation, likely from the hill country of Judah, reflecting the geographical setting of the region.<p><b>carried him back</b><br>The act of carrying Samson's body back to his homeland signifies a return to his roots and a final resting place among his people.

This era was marked by a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. Samson's judgeship, despite his personal failings, was part of God's plan to deliver Israel from Philistine oppression.

Here <span class="accented">his brethren</span> might mean the Danites generally, and <span class="accented">all the house of his father</span> those who were more nearly related, as belonging to the house of his father. His father was probably dead, and indeed the mention of his father's <span class="accented">burying-place</span>, or rather <span class="accented">sepulchre</span>, makes it certain that he was, so that Milton was in error in making him alive. <span class="cmt_word">Zorah and Eshtaol</span>.

The parallel between Samson and Hercules is in many respects very remarkable, and has been drawn out by Serdrius and others. The supernatural strength of each, the slavery to women ("Quem non mille for, quem non Sthenellius hostis, Non potuit Mayors vincere, vicit amor." Ovid), the tearing asunder of the lion, the violent death of each, partly voluntary and partly forced, are all points of strong general resemblance. But one of the most remarkable is the connection of Hercules with two pillars. The "pillars of Hercules" on each side the straits of Gibraltar, Mount Abila and Mount Calpe, were said to have been rent asunder by the strength of Hercules' arms. And Herodotus relates that in the temple of Hercules at Tyre were two remarkable pillars, one of refined gold, the other of smaragdus, some green stone like an emerald (2:44). But the account given of a visit of Hercules to Egypt is still more remarkable, as compared with the history of the binding of Samson and the slaughter of the Philistines, as related in ch. 15. The following are the words of Herodotus: - "The Greeks say that when Hercules went down to Egypt, the Egyptians surrounded him, and led him in a procession to sacrifice him to Jupiter; that he kept quite still for a time, but that when they were commencing the sacrifice at the altar" (the first act of which was cutting off the hair) "he turned in self-defence, and by his prowess slew them all." On which Herodo. tus remarks, "How was it possible for him, being but one, and being only a man, to slay many myriads?" The prevalence of the worship of Hercules among the Phoenicians, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, at Tyre and Thasos, a Phoenician colony, and the close connection of Egypt with Gaza, where the prowess of Samson was so well known, are points not to be omitted in considering the probability of some of the legends of Hercules being drawn from the history of Samson. So also is the title of the Phoenician Hercules, the saviour or deliverer, as compared with <a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16, 18</a>; <a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/16-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [Samson's] brothers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1436;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
