Karkor is believed to be a location east of the Jordan River, possibly in the region of modern-day Jordan. This area was significant as it was outside the immediate territory of Israel, indicating the extent of Gideon's pursuit. The presence of these kings in Karkor suggests a strategic retreat to regroup and fortify their position.<p><b>with their army of about fifteen thousand men</b><br>The number fifteen thousand indicates a significant reduction in their forces, highlighting the effectiveness of Gideon's earlier attacks. This remnant represents the survivors of a much larger force, emphasizing the scale of the conflict. The Midianites, along with their allies, were known for their large, nomadic armies that would invade and plunder Israel, as seen in previous chapters.<p><b>all that were left of the armies of the people of the east</b><br>The "people of the east" refers to a coalition of Midianites, Amalekites, and other nomadic tribes. These groups were known for their raids on Israel, often described as numerous as locusts. The phrase underscores the comprehensive defeat they suffered at the hands of Gideon, fulfilling God's promise to deliver Israel from their oppressors.<p><b>A hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had already fallen</b><br>This figure illustrates the magnitude of the victory God granted to Gideon and the Israelites. The defeat of such a vast number of swordsmen underscores the miraculous nature of the victory, as Gideon's initial force was only three hundred men. This event is a testament to God's power and faithfulness, as He delivered Israel despite overwhelming odds. The fall of these swordsmen also serves as a reminder of the consequences of opposing God's chosen people, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebah_and_zalmunna.htm">Zebah and Zalmunna</a></b><br>These were the kings of Midian, who were leading the remaining forces of their army.
