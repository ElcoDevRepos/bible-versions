The father-in-law's role was significant, often involving negotiations and hospitality. This reflects the patriarchal society where the father had authority over family matters. The mention of "the girl's father" emphasizes the familial bond and the importance of marriage alliances in maintaining social and economic stability.<p><b>persuaded him to stay</b><br>Hospitality was a crucial aspect of ancient Near Eastern culture. The act of persuasion indicates the father-in-law's desire to extend hospitality, which was a sign of respect and goodwill. This reflects the cultural norm of treating guests with honor and ensuring their comfort, as seen in other biblical narratives like Abraham's hospitality to the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>.<p><b>so he remained with him three days</b><br>The number three often signifies completeness or divine perfection in the Bible. Staying three days could symbolize a complete period of rest and fellowship. This duration allowed for the strengthening of family ties and the fulfillment of social obligations. It also mirrors other biblical events where three days are significant, such as Jonah in the belly of the fish or Jesus in the tomb.<p><b>eating, drinking, and lodging there</b><br>These activities highlight the customs of hospitality and fellowship. Sharing meals was a way to build and affirm relationships. Eating and drinking together were acts of peace and friendship, often seen in covenant-making contexts. Lodging indicates the provision of shelter and safety, which were essential aspects of hospitality in a time when travel could be dangerous. This phrase underscores the importance of community and the provision of basic needs within a familial setting.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Levi, who is central to the account in <a href="/bsb/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>.
