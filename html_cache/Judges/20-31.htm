This reflects the internal strife and moral decline during the period of the Judges, a time characterized by the repeated cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. The Benjamites' willingness to confront their fellow Israelites highlights the deep divisions and the severity of the conflict.<p><b>and were drawn away from the city.</b><br>The strategy employed by the Israelites involved luring the Benjamites away from the safety of their city, Gibeah. This tactic is reminiscent of military strategies seen elsewhere in the Bible, such as Joshua's ambush at Ai (Joshua 8). The drawing away from the city indicates a planned maneuver to weaken the Benjamites' defensive position.<p><b>They began to attack the people as before,</b><br>This phrase suggests a repeated pattern of aggression by the Benjamites, indicating their confidence and previous success in battle. It also underscores the ongoing nature of the conflict, with the Benjamites initially having the upper hand, as seen in earlier verses where they inflicted heavy casualties on the Israelites.<p><b>killing about thirty men of Israel in the fields and on the roads,</b><br>The specific mention of "fields and on the roads" indicates the widespread nature of the battle, not confined to a single location. This detail highlights the chaos and the tactical disadvantage faced by the Israelites. The number thirty, while relatively small, serves to illustrate the initial success of the Benjamites' attack.<p><b>one of which led up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.</b><br>Bethel and Gibeah are significant locations in biblical history. Bethel, meaning "house of God," was a place of worship and spiritual significance, while Gibeah was the Benjamite city at the center of the conflict. The roads leading to these locations suggest strategic routes and the importance of controlling access to key areas. The mention of these roads also provides geographical context, indicating the proximity of the battle to these notable sites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, known for their skilled warriors.

The A.V. is the natural rendering of the Hebrew words, which imply a <span class="accented">Gibeah in the field</span> different from <span class="accented">Gibeah</span>, as the Septuagint seems to have understood them (<span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>). It is a happy conjecture, borne out by the existing roads, that this Gibeah-in-the-field is the same as <span class="accented">Gobs</span>, now <span class="accented">Jeba.</span> Indeed it is almost impossible to conceive how the pursuers, coming out of Gibeah, could be described as coming to two highways, of which one led to Bethel and the other to the very place they had come from. The latest explorers of the district fully concur in this identification of Gibeah-in-the-field with Jeba. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Benjamites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1456;&#1488;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
