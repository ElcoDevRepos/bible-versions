This phrase indicates that these tribes did not participate in the battle against Sisera, choosing instead to stay in their territory. Historically, the area of Gilead was known for its balm, a valuable commodity, suggesting a focus on trade and economic stability over military engagement. The decision to remain "beyond the Jordan" highlights a division among the Israelite tribes, reflecting a lack of unity during the time of the Judges. This division can be seen as a recurring theme in Israel's history, where geographical and tribal loyalties sometimes took precedence over national unity.<p><b>Dan, why did you linger by the ships?</b><br>The tribe of Dan was originally allocated land in the central coastal region of Israel, but due to pressure from the Philistines, they later migrated northward. The mention of "lingering by the ships" suggests a preoccupation with maritime activities or trade, possibly indicating a reluctance to engage in the inland conflict. This phrase underscores the challenges faced by the tribe of Dan, who struggled to secure their inheritance and often found themselves in conflict with surrounding peoples. The rhetorical question implies a critique of their priorities, as they chose economic pursuits over joining their fellow Israelites in battle. This can be seen as a reflection of the broader theme of Israel's struggle to fully possess the land and remain faithful to their covenantal responsibilities.<p><b>Asher stayed at the coast and remained in his harbors.</b><br>The tribe of Asher was located along the northern coast of Israel, an area known for its fertile land and access to the Mediterranean Sea. By "staying at the coast," Asher is depicted as choosing the comfort and security of their established settlements over participating in the conflict. The mention of "harbors" suggests a focus on trade and economic prosperity, similar to Dan. This decision reflects the challenges of tribalism and the temptation to prioritize local interests over national concerns. The coastal location of Asher also made them more susceptible to influence from neighboring Canaanite cities, which may have contributed to their reluctance to engage in the battle. This highlights the ongoing struggle for Israel to maintain its distinct identity amidst surrounding cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain.

Deborah&#8217;s song points out that those brethren, geographically separated, chose comfort over covenant duty.<p>&#8226; Their inheritance was legitimate, yet they allowed distance to dull devotion. While Naphtali and Zebulun &#8220;risked their lives on the heights of the battlefield&#8221; (<a href="/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>), Gilead watched from across the river.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores the sobering truth that convenience often competes with obedience.

The name is here probably meant to include Gad, as well as the half-tribe of Manasseh. The word "abode" means "stayed quietly" (<a href="/psalms/16-9.htm" title="Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest in hope.">Psalm 16:9</a>), and is rendered <span class= "ital">qniesce-bat </span>in the Vulgate.<p><span class= "bld">Why did Dan remain in ships?</span>--The sudden question is very picturesque. The other rendering, "Why did Dan fear the ships (of the enemy)? "is untenable.

The word rendered "remain" often involves a notion of "alarm" (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-27.htm" title="Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD has not done all this.">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>)<span class= "ital">. </span>If the Danite migration (Judges 18) had by this time occurred, it is almost impossible that they should not have rendered some assistance to the revolt of the northern tribes.
