Gaza was a significant city located on the coastal route between Egypt and Canaan, making it strategically important. The Philistines were often in conflict with the Israelites during the time of the Judges. Samson, a judge of Israel, was known for his extraordinary strength and his conflicts with the Philistines. His presence in Gaza would have been alarming to the Gazites, as he had previously caused great destruction to their people (<a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14-15</a>).<p><b>they surrounded that place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate</b><br>The city gate was a place of both security and commerce, often heavily fortified and guarded. By surrounding the place and waiting at the gate, the Gazites intended to trap Samson, preventing his escape. This tactic reflects the Philistines' fear and respect for Samson's strength, as they knew they needed to be strategic to capture him. The city gate was also a place of judgment and public assembly, indicating the seriousness of their intent.<p><b>They were quiet throughout the night, saying,</b><br>The Gazites' decision to remain quiet suggests a strategic approach to ensure Samson would not be alerted to their presence. This reflects the cunning and patience often required in warfare and conflict during this period. Their silence indicates the gravity of their plan and their determination to succeed in capturing Samson.<p><b>&#8220;Let us wait until dawn; then we will kill him.&#8221;</b><br>The plan to wait until dawn shows the Gazites' desire to catch Samson off guard, likely when he would be least prepared to defend himself. This reflects the common practice of launching attacks at dawn, a time when people were vulnerable and less alert. The intent to kill Samson highlights the deep animosity and fear the Philistines had towards him, as he was a significant threat to their dominance over Israel. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Samson, who, despite his strength, was vulnerable due to his personal weaknesses and choices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

Each move exposes fear, hatred, and reliance on human strategy. Yet the following verse shows that no plot, however carefully crafted, can outmaneuver the Lord&#8217;s purpose. The text calls readers to trust God&#8217;s unseen protection and to remember that what looks like darkness and entrapment to us is never beyond His power to overturn.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And it was told.</span>--Our version rightly supplies these words.

These words have no doubt accidentally fallen out of the Hebrew text, but they are necessary to the sense, and are expressed in all the ancient versions. We have no clue as to the motive of Samson's visit to Gaza, whether he was meditating its conquest, or an assault upon its inhabitants, or whether he came merely in the wild spirit of adventure, or upon civil business. We only know that he came there, that, with his usual weakness, he fell into the snare of female blandishments, that the Philistines thought to have caught him and killed him, but that he escaped by his supernatural strength. Gaza is about thirteen hours' march from Thimnathah. <span class="cmt_word">They compassed him in</span>. The Hebrew does not express this idea, nor is it what the Gazites did. It should be rendered, <span class="accented">They went about and lay in wait for him.</span> Instead of attacking him directly, they took a round-about course, and set an ambush for him in the city gates, probably in the guard-room by the side of the gate, intending when he came forth unsuspectingly in the morning, at the hour of opening the gates, to rush upon him and kill him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/16-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the Gazites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1469;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;
