However, the ambiguity of "whatever" suggests Jephthah might have been thinking of a human, possibly a servant, as well. This reflects the seriousness of vows in the ancient Near Eastern culture, where words held significant power and were binding.<p><b>to greet me on my triumphant return</b><br>Victory in battle was seen as a sign of divine favor. Jephthah's expectation of a triumphant return indicates his confidence in God's support against the Ammonites. This reflects the cultural practice of celebrating military victories with processions and offerings, a common occurrence in the ancient world.<p><b>from the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel. This historical enmity is rooted in territorial disputes and differing religious practices. The conflict with the Ammonites in <a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a> highlights the cyclical nature of Israel's disobedience and deliverance, a central theme in the Book of Judges.<p><b>will belong to the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates a dedication to God, which in the context of the Old Testament, often meant setting something apart for divine use. The concept of belonging to the LORD is seen in various forms, such as the consecration of the firstborn (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>) and the Nazirite vow (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>).<p><b>and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.&#8221;</b><br>Burnt offerings were a common form of sacrifice in the Old Testament, symbolizing atonement and complete surrender to God. The gravity of Jephthah's vow is underscored by the irreversible nature of a burnt offering, which was entirely consumed by fire. This reflects the seriousness with which vows were regarded and the potential for tragic outcomes when made rashly. The story of Jephthah's daughter, which follows, serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of such vows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his vow to God and his victory over the Ammonites.

Her grief over never marrying (<a href="/judges/11-37.htm">Judges 11:37</a>) supports this reading.<p>&#8226; Either way, the narrative highlights the gravity of vows (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>) and the tragedy that follows impulsive commitments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jephthah&#8217;s vow in <a href="/judges/11-31.htm">Judges 11:31</a> demonstrates sincere faith mixed with rash speech. He pledges that whatever first exits his house after victory will be wholly devoted to God, even as a burnt offering. The text teaches the seriousness of vows, the need for thoughtful obedience over impulsive zeal, and God&#8217;s displeasure with human sacrifice&#8212;all set against the backdrop of Israel&#8217;s moral confusion during the era of the judges.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Whatsoever cometh forth.</span>--The true rendering undoubtedly is, <span class= "ital">Whosoever cometh forth </span>(LXX., <span class= "greekheb">? ?????????????</span>; Vulg., <span class= "ital">quicunque</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Nothing can be clearer than that the view held of this passage, from early Jewish days down to the Middle Ages, and still held by nearly all unbiased commentators, is the true one, and alone adequately explains the text: viz., that Jephthah, ignorant as he was--being a man of semi-heathen parentage, and long familiarised with heathen surroundings--contemplated a human sacrifice. To say that he imagined that <span class= "ital">an animal </span>would "come forth of the doors of his house to meet him" on his triumphant return is a notion which even St. Augustine ridicules. The offer to sacrifice a single animal--even if we <span class= "ital">could </span>suppose an animal "coming forth to meet" Jephthah--would be strangely inadequate. It would be assumed as a matter of course that not one, but <span class= "ital">many </span>holocausts of animals would express the gratitude of Israel. Pfeiffer sensibly observes (<span class= "ital">Dub. vexata, </span>p. 356): "What kind of vow would it be if some great prince or general should say, 'O God, if Thou wilt give me this victory, the first calf that meets me shall be Thine?'" Jephthah left God, as it were, to choose His own victim, and probably anticipated that it would be some slave. The notion of human sacrifice was all but universal among ancient nations, and it was specially prevalent among the Syrians, among whom Jephthah had lived for so many years, and among the Ph?nicians, whose gods had been recently adopted by the Israelites (<a href="/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Judges 10:6</a>). Further than this, it was the peculiar worship of the Moabites and Ammonites, against whom Jephthah was marching to battle; and one who had been a rude freebooter, in a heathen country and a lawless epoch, when constant and grave violations of the Law were daily tolerated, might well suppose in his ignorance that Jehovah would need to be propitiated by some offering as costly as those which bled on the altars of Chemosh and Moloch. Human sacrifice had been "the first thought of Balak in the extremity of his terror" (<a href="/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?">Micah 6:7</a>), and "the last expedient of Balak's successor" (<a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm" title="Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.">2Kings 3:27</a>)--Stanley, i. 358. If it be urged that after the great lesson which had been taught to Abraham at Jehovah-jireh the very notion of human sacrifice ought to have become abhorrent to any Israelite, especially as it had been expressly forbidden in the Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm" title="And you shall not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm" title="You shall not do so to the LORD your God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hates, have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>, &c), one more than sufficient answer is that <span class= "ital">even in the wilderness </span>Israel had been guilty of Moloch-worship (<a href="/ezekiel/20-26.htm" title="And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 20:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm" title="Concerning the Ammonites, thus said the LORD; Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?">Jeremiah 49:1</a>; <span class= "ital">Melcom, </span><a href="/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a>; <a href="/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a>). The Law was one thing; the knowledge of it and the observance of it was quite another. During this period we find the Law violated again and again, even by judges like Gideon and Samson; and the tendency to violate it by human sacrifices lasted down to the far more enlightened and civilised days of Ahaz and Manasseh (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-6.htm" title="And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Chronicles 33:6</a>). Indeed, we find the priests expressly sanctioning, even in the palmiest days of David's reign, an execution which, to the vulgar, would bear an aspect not far removed from human sacrifice, or (rather) which might easily be confused with the spirit which led to it (<a href="/context/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.">2Samuel 21:1-9</a>). If, again, it be said that the possibility of Jephthah's being guilty of so rash and evil a vow is excluded by the phrase that "the Spirit of the Lord came upon him," such reasoning is to substitute idle fancies for clear facts. The Spirit of the Lord "clothed" Gideon, yet he set up an illegal worship. The "Spirit of the Lord" came upon Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-23.htm" title="And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.">1Samuel 19:23</a>), yet Saul contemplated slaying his own son out of regard for no less foolish a vow (<a href="/1_samuel/14-44.htm" title="And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan.">1Samuel 14:44</a>). The "Spirit of the Lord" came upon David <span class= "ital">"</span>from that day forward" on which Samuel anointed him (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm" title="Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.">1Samuel 16:13</a>), yet he could sink into adultery and murder. The phrase must not be interpreted of high or permanent spiritual achievement, but of Divine strength granted for a particular end. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/11-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then whatever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">comes out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
