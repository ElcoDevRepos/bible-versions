It symbolized peace and mutual respect between parties. This setting in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a> reflects the customs of the time, where hospitality was a sacred duty, especially towards travelers. The act of eating and drinking together often signified the establishment or renewal of a covenant or agreement, as seen in <a href="/genesis/26-30.htm">Genesis 26:30</a>, where Isaac makes a covenant with Abimelech. This phrase also highlights the importance of community and relationship, which are central themes throughout the Bible.<p><b>Then the girl&#8217;s father said to the man,</b><br>The girl's father, acting as the host, plays a crucial role in the narrative. In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, the father was the head of the household and responsible for the well-being of his family and guests. His involvement in the conversation underscores the cultural norms of the time, where family heads negotiated and made decisions. This interaction can be compared to other biblical instances where fathers or patriarchs engage in negotiations or discussions, such as Laban with Jacob in <a href="/genesis/31.htm">Genesis 31</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Please agree to stay overnight and let your heart be merry.&#8221;</b><br>The father's invitation to stay overnight and enjoy oneself reflects the cultural emphasis on hospitality. In the ancient world, travel was arduous and dangerous, making the offer of shelter and sustenance a vital aspect of hospitality. The phrase "let your heart be merry" suggests a desire for the guest to find joy and relaxation, a common theme in biblical hospitality, as seen in the story of Abraham entertaining angels in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. This invitation also foreshadows the events to come, as the narrative in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a> takes a dark turn, highlighting the contrast between the initial hospitality and the subsequent violence. The call to merriment can be seen as a temporary reprieve from the harsh realities of life, a theme echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>, where enjoying life is encouraged amidst life's uncertainties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Levi who is traveling to retrieve his concubine.
