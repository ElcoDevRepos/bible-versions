The use of horns, or trumpets, in battle was a common practice in ancient Israel, often signifying a call to arms or a divine intervention (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). The blowing of horns by Gideon and his men symbolizes a coordinated effort and reliance on God's guidance. The trumpet, or shofar, was made from a ram's horn and was used in religious and military contexts, emphasizing the sacred nature of their mission.<p><b>then you are also to blow your horns from all around the camp</b><br>Gideon's strategy involved surrounding the Midianite camp, creating confusion and fear among the enemy. This tactic of encirclement is reminiscent of the battle of Jericho, where the Israelites used a similar strategy to achieve victory (<a href="/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a>). The simultaneous blowing of horns from all sides would have amplified the sound, making the Israelite force seem larger and more formidable than it was. This reflects God's power working through seemingly inadequate means, a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>and shout, &#8216;For the LORD and for Gideon!&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The shout serves as both a battle cry and a declaration of allegiance. By invoking the name of the LORD, the Israelites acknowledge that their victory depends on divine intervention. The inclusion of Gideon's name signifies his role as God's chosen leader and judge, emphasizing the human-divine partnership in achieving deliverance. This dual cry can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus is both the divine Savior and the human leader who brings victory over sin and death. The phrase also underscores the importance of faith and obedience in the face of overwhelming odds, a lesson applicable to believers throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

The command comes after he has divided the 300 men into three companies and placed a ram&#8217;s horn in every hand (<a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16-17</a>).<p>- Their united blast declares faith that the LORD Himself will fight (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>).<p>- Similar acts: Joshua&#8217;s priests blowing trumpets around Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>); Jehoshaphat&#8217;s singers leading Judah into battle (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-21.htm">2 Chronicles 20:21-22</a>). Each case highlights that victory begins with worshipful obedience, not military might.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you are also to blow your horns</b><p>- Gideon transfers the pattern to his men, inviting them to participate in God&#8217;s miracle (<a href="/judges/7-17.htm">Judges 7:17</a>).<p>- Obedience is immediate and simultaneous, reflecting the body-life principle later urged on the church: &#8220;encourage one another&#8230; all the more as you see the Day approaching&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p>- The shared trumpet blast pictures the believer&#8217;s call to join in Christ&#8217;s triumph rather than remain a silent spectator (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From all around the camp</b><p>- Surrounding the Midianites with only 300 men creates the illusion of a vast army. The tactic relies on God to magnify small means (<a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>).<p>- God often encircles the enemy: the Angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>); Elisha&#8217;s servant sees heavenly chariots surrounding Dothan (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<p>- The lesson: when God positions His people, He also positions His own forces, guaranteeing that we are &#8220;more than conquerors&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And shout, &#8216;For the LORD and for Gideon!&#8217;</b><p>- The cry keeps priority clear: the LORD first, Gideon second. God receives ultimate glory, yet He honors human instruments (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>).<p>- Identifying with God&#8217;s appointed leader unifies the ranks and testifies that Gideon&#8217;s authority is derived, not self-made (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>).<p>- The shout itself becomes a weapon; God turns the Midianite swords against one another (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>), echoing how praise routed Moab and Ammon in Jehoshaphat&#8217;s day (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18</a> captures a divinely scripted battle plan where worship, unity, and faith replace conventional warfare. Gideon sounds the first trumpet, his men echo it, they encircle the enemy, and together they proclaim allegiance to the LORD who fights through a willing servant. The verse teaches that when God&#8217;s people obey in concert with their God-given leadership, He magnifies their small efforts into overwhelming victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">for Jehovah and for Gideon </span>(LXX., <span class= "greekheb">?? ????? ??? ?? ??????</span>; Vulg., <span class= "ital">clangite et conclamate Domino et Gedeoni</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but the particle <span class= "ital">le </span>often has the meaning <span class= "ital">of</span>, as in "a Psalm to David," which is found at the beginning of many Psalms.

The mention of his own name was only for the purpose of terrifying the enemy (<a href="/judges/7-14.htm" title="And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God delivered Midian, and all the host.">Judges 7:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sword of the Lord</span>, etc. The word <span class="accented">sword</span> is not in the original here, though it is in ver. 20. It has either dropped out of the text accidentally, or what we have here is the shorter form of the war-cry. It is observable how careful Gideon is to put the name of Jehovah first. It was his cause against Baal, and the battle was to be fought in his strength, and the glory of the victory was to be his. The cry, "The sword of Gideon," would be peculiarly terrible to the many who had heard of the dream, of which the fulfilment was come so quickly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/7-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
