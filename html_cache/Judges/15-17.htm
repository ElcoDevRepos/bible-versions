This moment highlights his role as a judge and deliverer of Israel, empowered by the Spirit of the Lord.

Naming places after significant events was a common practice in biblical times, serving as a memorial to God's intervention. This act of naming is reminiscent of other biblical figures who named locations to commemorate divine encounters, such as Jacob naming Bethel in <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>.
