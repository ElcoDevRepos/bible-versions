The "survivors" refer to the remaining men of Benjamin, who were left without wives due to the near annihilation of their tribe. This situation highlights the consequences of rash vows and the need for wisdom in decision-making. The Israelites were seeking a solution to preserve the tribe of Benjamin, which was essential for maintaining the twelve tribes of Israel, a foundational aspect of Israelite identity and God's covenant with Abraham.<p><b>since we have sworn by the LORD</b><br>The Israelites had made a solemn oath before God, which was binding and carried significant weight. In the ancient Near Eastern context, oaths were serious commitments that invoked divine witness and judgment. Breaking such an oath was considered a grave sin. This reflects the importance of integrity and the fear of the Lord in Israelite society. The Israelites' oath not to give their daughters to the Benjamites was made in the heat of anger and grief, demonstrating the potential pitfalls of making hasty vows.<p><b>not to give them our daughters in marriage?</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the specific nature of the oath, which created a moral and social dilemma. Marriage alliances were crucial for tribal unity and continuity. The prohibition against giving their daughters to the Benjamites threatened the survival of the tribe. This situation required the Israelites to find a creative solution that would honor their oath while ensuring the preservation of Benjamin. The broader biblical narrative often addresses the tension between law and grace, justice and mercy, as seen in the eventual resolution of this crisis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel who are dealing with the aftermath of a civil war against the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_benjamin.htm">Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, nearly annihilated due to their involvement in a grievous sin and the subsequent war.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>A place where the Israelites gathered to discuss the situation and make decisions regarding the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/civil_war.htm">Civil War</a></b><br>The conflict between the tribe of Benjamin and the other Israelite tribes, resulting in significant loss of life and the near extinction of Benjamin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oath_to_the_lord.htm">Oath to the LORD</a></b><br>The Israelites had sworn not to give their daughters in marriage to the Benjamites, complicating the restoration of the tribe.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rash_vows.htm">The Consequences of Rash Vows</a></b><br>Making vows without considering the long-term implications can lead to difficult situations.
