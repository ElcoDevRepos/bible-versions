The men of the city likely refer to the inhabitants of Ophrah, where Gideon lived. In ancient Israelite culture, the morning was a time for communal activities and gatherings, making it significant that the discovery of the altar's destruction happened then.<p><b>there was Baal&#8217;s altar torn down</b><br>Baal was a prominent Canaanite deity, often associated with fertility and storms. The presence of Baal's altar indicates the syncretism and idolatry that had infiltrated Israelite society, contrary to the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The tearing down of the altar symbolizes a direct challenge to the prevailing pagan worship and a call back to the worship of Yahweh. This act of destruction is reminiscent of the prophetic actions of Elijah on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-20.htm">1 Kings 18:20-40</a>).<p><b>with the Asherah pole cut down beside it</b><br>Asherah was a goddess worshipped alongside Baal, often represented by a wooden pole or tree. The cutting down of the Asherah pole signifies the removal of idolatrous practices and the purification of worship. This act aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>, which commands the Israelites not to set up any Asherah pole beside the altar of the Lord.<p><b>and the second bull offered up on the newly built altar</b><br>The offering of the second bull is significant as it represents a sacrifice to Yahweh, contrasting the idolatrous practices previously conducted. The use of a "second bull" may imply a specific choice or instruction from God, as seen earlier in <a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-26</a>. The newly built altar signifies a fresh start and a return to proper worship, echoing the construction of altars by patriarchs like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>) and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a>). This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who would fulfill and replace the need for continual sacrifices through His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

When the men of the city got up in the morning &#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-28.htm">Judges 6:28</a>) drops us into a normal dawn that turns extraordinary.<p>&#8226; Gideon had acted under cover of night so the discovery breaks only with daylight (<a href="/judges/6-27.htm">Judges 6:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God often allows darkness to conceal His servants until the appointed moment of revelation&#8212;think of Samuel hearing God before dawn (<a href="/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3&#8211;11</a>) or the Philistines finding Dagon toppled at daybreak (<a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The townspeople represent Israel&#8217;s compromising culture; their first concern each morning should have been the LORD&#8217;s praise (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>), yet their routine centers on Baal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There was Baal&#8217;s altar torn down</b><p>&#8220;

The dismantled altar is a public rebuttal of Baal&#8217;s supposed power, echoing Elijah&#8217;s later challenge on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30&#8211;39</a>).<p>&#8226; Tearing down idols is a covenant expectation (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>;

Baal and Asherah were partnered deities of Canaanite fertility; removing one without the other would leave a foothold (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Gideon&#8217;s thoroughness mirrors Hezekiah&#8217;s reforms centuries later when he &#8220;broke into pieces the bronze serpent&#8221; and destroyed the Asherah (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The single stroke against both idols underscores that God tolerates no rival (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the second bull offered up on the newly built altar</b><p>&#8220;

New devotion replaces old idolatry; Noah set the pattern after the flood (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>), and Elijah rebuilt an altar with twelve stones for a divided nation (<a href="/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/6-28.htm">Judges 6:28</a> captures the moment Israel wakes to find their false security shattered and a fresh altar blazing for the LORD.
