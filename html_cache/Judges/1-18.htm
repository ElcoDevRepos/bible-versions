This reflects the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>, where Judah is prophesied to be a leader among his brothers. The capturing of territories by Judah signifies the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites the land of Canaan (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>).<p><b>Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron</b><br>These cities were part of the Philistine pentapolis, a group of five cities that were significant centers of Philistine power. The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel throughout the period of the Judges and into the time of the monarchy. The capture of these cities by Judah indicates a temporary subjugation of Philistine influence. Archaeological evidence shows these cities were well-fortified and strategically important, located along trade routes and near the coast, which would have been advantageous for controlling commerce and military movements.<p><b>each with its territory</b><br>The mention of "each with its territory" emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Judah's conquest. It was not just the cities themselves that were captured, but also the surrounding lands, which would have included agricultural areas and smaller settlements. This detail underscores the extent of Judah's control and the fulfillment of God's command to possess the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). The territories would have been crucial for sustaining the population and securing the region against future threats.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Leah.
