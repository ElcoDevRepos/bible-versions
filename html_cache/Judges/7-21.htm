The Israelites, numbering only 300, were instructed by God to surround the Midianite camp. This act of taking position signifies faith and trust in God's plan, as they were vastly outnumbered. The positioning around the camp is reminiscent of the Israelites' encirclement of Jericho (Joshua 6), where obedience to God's unconventional strategy led to victory. It also reflects the importance of unity and discipline among God's people, as each man had a specific role to play in the divine plan.<p><b>and the entire Midianite army fled</b><br>The flight of the Midianite army is a testament to God's power and the fulfillment of His promise to deliver Israel. Historically, the Midianites were a nomadic people who had oppressed Israel, and their sudden retreat underscores the fear and confusion God instilled in them. This event parallels other instances in Scripture where God causes confusion among enemy forces, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-23</a>, where the Ammonites and Moabites turned against each other. It demonstrates that victory comes not by might, but by the Spirit of the Lord (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p><b>crying out as they ran</b><br>The Midianites' cries as they fled indicate panic and terror, a common reaction when God intervenes on behalf of His people. This panic was likely exacerbated by the sound of trumpets and the breaking of jars by Gideon's men, creating the illusion of a larger force. The cries can be seen as a fulfillment of the fear prophesied in <a href="/judges/7-14.htm">Judges 7:14</a>, where a Midianite soldier interprets a dream as a sign of their defeat by Gideon. This scene foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over His enemies, where those who oppose God will be put to flight (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The judge chosen by God to lead Israel against the Midianites.

When the signal came, no one rushed ahead or lagged behind; every man occupied the exact spot assigned to him (<a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19</a>).<p>- The scene illustrates disciplined obedience. Standing firm in one&#8217;s God-given place echoes Paul&#8217;s call to &#8220;put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you will be able to stand your ground&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>; cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p>- Victory began with steadfast positioning, not numerical strength&#8212;an enduring reminder that faithfulness in the place God assigns is itself a strategic act of warfare (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>around the camp</b><p>- The 300 encircled the vast Midianite host, creating the impression of a massive army. This tactical placement magnified God&#8217;s power by turning weakness into perceived strength (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p>- Encirclement also speaks of God&#8217;s people surrounding the enemy with praise and obedience, much like Israel marching around Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2-5</a>) or Jehoshaphat&#8217;s singers advancing ahead of the army (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-21.htm">2 Chronicles 20:21-22</a>).<p>- What looks like vulnerability&#8212;small groups spaced around a hill&#8212;becomes overwhelming when the Lord fights for His people (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the entire Midianite army fled</b><p>- The flight of a seasoned force before 300 torch-bearers highlights the Lord&#8217;s promise: &#8220;The enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you; they will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>; cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-7.htm">Leviticus 26:7-8</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s strategy caused confusion within the Midianite ranks (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>), recalling earlier moments when He turned enemy swords against one another (<a href="/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>).<p>- Spiritual application: when believers resist the devil, he must flee (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>). God-directed resistance, even by a minority, routs the adversary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>crying out as they ran</b><p>- Terror seized the Midianites. Scripture often records pagan armies melting in fear when they realize the Lord is present (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-4.htm">Psalm 48:4-6</a>).<p>- Their cries underline that the panic was supernatural; &#8220;the LORD set every man&#8217;s sword against his companion throughout the camp&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>).<p>- Compare <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>, where God made the Arameans hear an illusory army, prompting a hasty retreat. God can amplify small sounds&#8212;trumpets, shouts, jars breaking&#8212;into thunderous signals of His might.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-21.htm">Judges 7:21</a> portrays 300 obedient men standing exactly where God placed them, encircling the enemy, and watching as the Lord turned Midianite courage into chaotic flight. Their steady posture, God-given positioning, and reliance on divine power rather than human force demonstrate that victory belongs to the Lord. The passage calls believers today to take their God-assigned stand, trust His strategy, and expect Him to rout every foe that opposes His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Ran, and cried, and fled.</span>--They ran about to discover the meaning of the trumpet-blast.
