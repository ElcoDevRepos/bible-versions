In the context of the narrative, Delilah's actions reflect a strategic and manipulative approach, similar to the tactics used by other figures in the Bible who sought to achieve their goals through persistence. The daily pressure she applied can be seen as a test of Samson's resolve and character. This persistence is reminiscent of the nagging of the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11:1-6</a>) and the persistent widow in Jesus' parable (<a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>), though with different moral implications.<p><b>and pleaded until he was sick to death,</b><br>The phrase "sick to death" indicates the extreme emotional and psychological toll Delilah's actions had on Samson. This expression underscores the intensity of the situation and Samson's vulnerability. Historically, the Philistines, who Delilah was aligned with, were known for their enmity with the Israelites, and this personal conflict between Samson and Delilah reflects the larger national struggle. The phrase also foreshadows Samson's eventual downfall, as his physical strength was not matched by spiritual or emotional resilience. This can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, unlike Samson, withstood temptation and pressure (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), highlighting the contrast between human weakness and divine strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A Philistine woman who was used by the Philistine rulers to discover the secret of Samson's strength.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The enemies of Israel during the time of the judges, who sought to subdue Samson through Delilah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_sorek.htm">Valley of Sorek</a></b><br>The location where Samson met Delilah, a place associated with temptation and betrayal.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite_vow.htm">Nazirite Vow</a></b><br>A vow taken by Samson that included not cutting his hair, which was the source of his strength.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_persistent_temptation.htm">The Danger of Persistent Temptation</a></b><br>Delilah's persistence is a reminder of how temptation can wear down even the strongest individuals.

The word &#8220;finally&#8221; marks the breaking point. God&#8217;s Word often shows a &#8220;last straw&#8221; moment when repeated temptation meets a heart already flirting with compromise (cf. &#8220;When desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin,&#8221; <a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The patient mercy of God is real (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), yet persistent dabbling with sin eventually reaps a harvest (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s flirtation with danger mirrors Israel&#8217;s larger cycle in Judges&#8212;delivering grace followed by fresh rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after she had pressed him daily</b><p>Delilah&#8217;s strategy is relentless, not dramatic. Scripture warns that temptation often arrives &#8220;day after day&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/39-10.htm">Genesis 39:10</a>, Potiphar&#8217;s wife with Joseph).<p>&#8226; Daily pressure can erode firm convictions when they are not daily reinforced (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual victory yesterday is no guarantee for today; we &#8220;take up&#8221; the armor repeatedly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with her words</b><p>Words matter. &#8220;With her enticing speech she caused him to yield&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/7-21.htm">Proverbs 7:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The tongue can be a tool for either life or manipulation (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Listening unguardedly to voices that contradict God&#8217;s call slowly shifts the heart (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and pleaded</b><p>Delilah moves from flattery to emotional leverage.
