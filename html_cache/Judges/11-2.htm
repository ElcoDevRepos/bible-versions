Sons born to a wife held a higher status and were typically the primary inheritors of the family estate. This reflects the patriarchal structure of the time, where lineage and inheritance were passed through male descendants.<p><b>who grew up</b><br>The sons reaching maturity signifies their readiness to assert their rights and responsibilities within the family. In ancient Israel, reaching adulthood meant taking on roles in the community and family, including decisions about inheritance and leadership. This transition often brought about familial tensions, especially in cases of blended families or disputes over inheritance.<p><b>drove Jephthah out</b><br>Jephthah's expulsion by his half-brothers underscores the social stigma associated with illegitimacy. In the cultural context of the time, being the son of a concubine or another woman often led to marginalization. This act of driving Jephthah out reflects the harsh realities of family dynamics and societal norms that prioritized legitimate heirs.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;You shall have no inheritance in our father&#8217;s house</b><br>Inheritance was a critical aspect of family and tribal identity in ancient Israel. By denying Jephthah a share in the inheritance, his brothers were not only excluding him from material wealth but also from the social and spiritual heritage of their father. This exclusion reflects the legal and cultural practices of the time, where inheritance rights were closely tied to legitimacy and birthright.<p><b>because you are the son of another woman.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the distinction made between children of a wife and those of other women, such as concubines or mistresses. The term "another woman" indicates Jephthah's lower status in the family hierarchy. This situation parallels other biblical narratives where children of different mothers face conflict, such as Ishmael and Isaac or Esau and Jacob. It also foreshadows Jephthah's rise to leadership despite his initial rejection, drawing a parallel to the theme of God using the marginalized for His purposes, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like David and Joseph.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A mighty warrior and the son of Gilead, born to a prostitute.
