This geographical setting is significant as it highlights the tension between the Israelites and the Philistines, who were often in conflict. The phrase "went down" not only indicates a physical descent but can also symbolize a spiritual decline, as Samson's actions in Timnah lead to a series of events that reflect his personal weaknesses and struggles with temptation. Timnah's location is strategic, serving as a crossroads between the two cultures, which often led to interactions that were both politically and personally complex.<p><b>where he saw a young Philistine woman</b><br>The mention of a "young Philistine woman" introduces a key element in Samson's narrative: his attraction to foreign women, which is a recurring theme in his life. The Philistines were one of Israel's primary adversaries, and intermarriage with them was discouraged due to the potential for idolatry and cultural assimilation. This encounter foreshadows the challenges Samson will face due to his relationships with Philistine women, ultimately leading to his downfall. Theologically, this reflects the broader biblical theme of Israel's struggle to remain distinct and faithful amidst surrounding pagan influences. Samson's desire for the Philistine woman can be seen as a type of Israel's own infatuation with foreign gods and practices, which often led them away from their covenant with Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

And on the Sabbath day He went into the synagogue&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Scripture routinely anchors events in real time to remind us God works in ordinary days as well as extraordinary ones (see <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a> &#8220;Now Moses was shepherding&#8230;&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The text prepares us for a turning point in Samson&#8217;s life, showing how a single day can redirect a destiny for good or ill (compare <a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>, another pivotal &#8220;one evening&#8221; for David).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samson went down to Timnah</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Went down&#8221; is both geographical (Timnah sits lower in elevation) and spiritual foreshadowing; each downward step hints at Samson&#8217;s repeated compromises (<a href="/judges/16-1.htm">Judges 16:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Timnah lay in territory allotted to Dan yet under Philistine control (<a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>). The judge of Israel is already stepping into enemy-held ground.<p>&#8226; Contrast Samson&#8217;s movement with Israel&#8217;s earlier command to drive out the Philistines (<a href="/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-4</a>).

Sight unchecked by obedience becomes a doorway to sin.<p>&#8226; Yet God can sovereignly steer even flawed choices; verse 4 will reveal the Lord &#8220;was seeking an occasion against the Philistines&#8221;, displaying divine providence amid human weakness (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A young Philistine woman</b><p>&#8226; Philistines were uncircumcised adversaries of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>).

Compare Isaac&#8217;s servant who sought a wife for Isaac among believers (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Nevertheless, the encounter sets in motion confrontations that will bruise Philistine power, previewing Samson&#8217;s role as deliverer (<a href="/judges/15-3.htm">Judges 15:3-5, 20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1</a> captures a literal moment in Samson&#8217;s early adulthood when, on an ordinary day, he descends into enemy territory, follows his eyes, and fixes on a Philistine woman. The verse warns of the perils of unguarded desires, highlights Israel&#8217;s unfinished task against the Philistines, and quietly introduces God&#8217;s plan to use even Samson&#8217;s flawed choices to begin rescuing His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">To Timnath.</span>--This town, of which the site still retains the name Tibneh, is perhaps the same as that in <a href="/genesis/38-12.htm" title="And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.">Genesis 38:12</a>, unless that be a town in the mountains of Judah, as Judah is there said to have "gone <span class= "ital">up" </span>not as here, "down" to it.
