The context is that Samson has taken refuge in the territory of Judah after his conflict with the Philistines. The men of Judah are acting out of fear of the Philistines, who are oppressing them. This reflects the broader theme in Judges of Israel's repeated cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance.<p><b>&#8220;We have come down to arrest you</b><br>The men of Judah are willing to capture Samson to appease the Philistines, highlighting their subjugation and fear. This action shows a lack of faith in God's deliverance through Samson, who was raised as a judge to deliver Israel. It also underscores the internal strife and lack of unity among the Israelites during this period.<p><b>and hand you over to the Philistines.&#8221;</b><br>The Philistines were a dominant force in the region, and their oppression of Israel is a recurring theme in the book of Judges. The willingness of the men of Judah to hand over Samson indicates their desperation and the extent of Philistine control. This act of betrayal contrasts with the expected loyalty among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>Samson replied,</b><br>Samson's response is significant as it shows his awareness of the situation and his strategic thinking. Despite his personal flaws, Samson is portrayed as a divinely appointed judge with a mission to begin delivering Israel from the Philistines.<p><b>&#8220;Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.&#8221;</b><br>Samson's request for assurance from the men of Judah reflects his understanding of their fear and his desire to avoid unnecessary bloodshed among his own people. This request also demonstrates his confidence in his God-given strength to deal with the Philistines himself. It can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also betrayed by His own people but ultimately overcame His enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.
