The Israelites, led by Moses, requested peaceful passage through the land of the Amorites, promising not to harm or take anything. However, Sihon's refusal reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice of protecting territorial integrity against potential threats. This distrust can be seen as a lack of faith or understanding of God's plan for Israel, contrasting with the faith shown by Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>. The Amorites' resistance is also a fulfillment of God's earlier promise to Abraham that his descendants would face opposition from the inhabitants of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p><b>So he gathered all his people,</b><br>Sihon's decision to gather his people indicates a mobilization for war, a common response to perceived threats in ancient times. This action demonstrates the collective nature of ancient warfare, where entire communities, not just professional soldiers, would be involved in defense efforts. The gathering of people for battle also highlights the unity and loyalty within the Amorite kingdom, which contrasts with the internal divisions often seen in Israel's history.<p><b>encamped in Jahaz,</b><br>Jahaz was a strategic location east of the Jordan River, significant for its position on the King's Highway, a major trade route. This choice of encampment suggests Sihon's intent to control access and movement, a tactical decision to confront Israel in a place advantageous for defense. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of fortified sites in this region, indicating its importance in military strategy. The encampment at Jahaz sets the stage for a significant confrontation, reminiscent of other biblical battles where geography played a crucial role, such as the battle of Jericho.<p><b>and fought with Israel.</b><br>The battle between Sihon and Israel is a pivotal moment in Israel's journey to the Promised Land. It marks the beginning of Israel's military conquests east of the Jordan, fulfilling God's promise to give them the land. This conflict is not just a physical battle but also a spiritual one, as it demonstrates God's power and faithfulness in delivering His people. The victory over Sihon is later recounted in Psalms and by the prophets as a testament to God's might (<a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a>).
