It is likely in the hill country of Ephraim, which was a central region in Israel. This area was significant in Israel's history, often serving as a strategic location for military and religious activities. The arrival in Seirah marks a pivotal moment in Ehud's mission, as it is here that he begins to rally the Israelites for battle.<p><b>he blew the ram&#8217;s horn throughout the hill country of Ephraim</b><br>The blowing of the ram's horn, or shofar, was a traditional call to arms or a signal for gathering. It was used in various contexts in the Bible, such as in <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a> during the fall of Jericho. The hill country of Ephraim was a rugged and elevated region, providing a natural defense and a strategic advantage for military operations. The use of the shofar here signifies a divine call to action, rallying the Israelites to rise against their oppressors.<p><b>The Israelites came down with him from the hills</b><br>This phrase indicates a mobilization of the Israelite forces. The hills provided a natural stronghold, and descending from them suggests a readiness to engage in battle. The Israelites' response to Ehud's call reflects their trust in his leadership and their desire for deliverance from Moabite oppression. This collective movement underscores the unity and determination of the people in response to God's deliverance.<p><b>and he became their leader</b><br>Ehud's leadership is affirmed as he takes command of the Israelite forces. His role as a judge is solidified through this act of deliverance. In the broader biblical narrative, judges were raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression and lead them back to faithfulness. Ehud's leadership is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate deliverer and leader of God's people. This moment marks a turning point where Ehud transitions from a solitary figure to a recognized leader, guiding Israel to victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed judge of Israel from the tribe of Benjamin, who delivered Israel from Moabite oppression by assassinating King Eglon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/seirah.htm">Seirah</a></b><br>A location in the hill country of Ephraim where Ehud rallied the Israelites after his escape from Moabite territory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>A significant tribal region in central Israel, known for its strategic hill country, which played a crucial role in Israel's military campaigns.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/ram's_horn.htm">Ram&#8217;s Horn (Shofar)</a></b><br>A traditional instrument used in Israel for signaling, calling to assembly, or announcing significant events, such as war or religious festivals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who were under Moabite oppression and responded to Ehud's call to rise against their oppressors.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_use_of_unlikely_leaders.htm">God's Use of Unlikely Leaders</a></b><br>Ehud, a left-handed man in a right-handed world, was chosen by God to deliver Israel.

Seirah serves a similar purpose: a launch point for deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He blew the ram&#8217;s horn throughout the hill country of Ephraim</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He blew the ram&#8217;s horn&#8221; (shofar). In Israel, the shofar was more than noise; it signaled divine summons (<a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; By sounding it &#8220;throughout the hill country of Ephraim,&#8221; Ehud broadcasts God&#8217;s call to arms. The surrounding ridges would echo the blast, spreading the alarm quickly among scattered settlements.<p>&#8226; Gideon will later do the same (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>), and Saul still later (<a href="/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>). Each instance marks a moment when God stirs His people to confront oppression.<p>&#8226; The verse underlines Ehud&#8217;s faith. He trusts that God, who gave him victory over Eglon, will also rally the tribes when the trumpet sounds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Israelites came down with him from the hills</b><p>&#8226; Notice the ready response: they &#8220;came down with him.&#8221; Israel, long oppressed by Moab (<a href="/judges/3-14.htm">Judges 3:14</a>), recognizes God&#8217;s timing and follows without delay.<p>&#8226; Descending from the high ground into the Jordan Valley requires courage. Yet the same God who split the Jordan for Joshua (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>) now opens a path of victory through obedience.<p>&#8226; This unity contrasts with later periods of tribal hesitation (<a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15-17</a>). Here, the people move as one, demonstrating what happens when leadership aligns with God&#8217;s purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He became their leader</b><p>&#8226; The closing phrase, &#8220;and he became their leader,&#8221; shows an immediate transfer of authority. Leadership is not seized but conferred as the people discern God&#8217;s hand on Ehud.<p>&#8226; Earlier the angel identified Joshua as &#8220;leader&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14-15</a>). Later, God will raise Deborah, Gideon, and others (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4</a>; 6:12). Each case illustrates the Lord&#8217;s pattern: He appoints a deliverer, then confirms that appointment through victory.<p>&#8226; Ehud exemplifies servant-leadership&#8212;acting first, risking everything, then guiding God&#8217;s people into freedom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a> records a turning point in Israel&#8217;s story. Ehud reaches Seirah, sounds the shofar, rallies Ephraim&#8217;s warriors, and is acknowledged as leader. Every movement&#8212;location, trumpet blast, collective descent, and new leadership&#8212;highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness to raise deliverers when His people cry out. The verse teaches courage to act, readiness to follow, and confidence that the Lord still intervenes decisively for those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">He blew a trumpet.</span>--The word for "trumpet" is <span class= "ital">shophar. </span>The LXX. have "he trumpeted with a horn" (<span class= "ital">Esalpisen en keratine</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">In the mountain of Ephraim.</span>--The hill country of Ephraim was always the fastness of Israelitish freedom (<a href="/judges/4-5.htm" title="And she dwelled under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.">Judges 4:5</a>; <a href="/judges/10-1.htm" title="And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelled in Shamir in mount Ephraim.">Judges 10:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1Samuel 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm" title="When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.">1Samuel 13:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-22.htm" title="Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.">1Samuel 14:22</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He blew a trumpet</span>.

They could neither escape into Moab nor get help from Moab. Thrown into confusion by the death of their king and the suddenness of the attack, the Moabites fell to the number of 10,000 men; and so ended the second servitude, to be followed by a rest (if the numeral in the text is sound) of eighty years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/3-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On arriving [in Seirah],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
