In the cultural context of ancient Israel, women often played crucial roles in the family and community, though they were typically not the primary decision-makers. Her immediate action underscores the significance of the encounter with the angelic figure. This reflects the biblical theme of God using unexpected individuals to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used Mary, the mother of Jesus, to bring the Savior into the world.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, the man who came to me the other day has reappeared!&#8221;</b><br>The term "behold" is used to draw attention to something significant. The woman's recognition of the "man" as the same figure who appeared earlier suggests a divine encounter, as the "man" is later revealed to be the Angel of the LORD. This is a theophany, a manifestation of God in a form visible to humans. The reappearance emphasizes the continuity and certainty of God's message and plan. The Angel of the LORD is often seen as a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, as He speaks with authority and is worshiped, which aligns with the nature of Christ as the eternal Word. This encounter foreshadows the coming of Jesus, who would also be announced by an angelic messenger, as seen in the accounts of the Annunciation to Mary and Joseph.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman (Manoah's Wife)</a></b><br>She is the wife of Manoah and the mother of Samson.
