The context is a civil war within Israel, sparked by the grievous crime committed in Gibeah. The soldiers are from the eleven tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who are seeking justice. This internal conflict highlights the moral and social chaos during the time of the Judges, a period marked by the repeated cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance.<p><b>there were 700 select left-handers</b><br>Left-handedness is mentioned in the Bible as a notable trait, often associated with the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>). Being left-handed could provide a strategic advantage in battle, as opponents would be less accustomed to defending against left-handed attacks. The specificity of "700 select" indicates a group chosen for their exceptional skill, suggesting a level of military organization and specialization.<p><b>each of whom could sling a stone at a hair</b><br>The sling was a common weapon in ancient warfare, requiring great skill and precision. The ability to sling a stone "at a hair" signifies extraordinary accuracy. This skill would have been developed through extensive practice, reflecting the importance of slingers in ancient military tactics. The sling's effectiveness is also seen in the story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17), where David's skill with a sling plays a crucial role in his victory.<p><b>without missing</b><br>The phrase "without missing" underscores the remarkable proficiency of these soldiers. In Hebrew, the word for "sin" is often translated as "missing the mark," which can provide a metaphorical connection to spiritual accuracy and righteousness. The precision of these slingers can be seen as a parallel to the need for spiritual precision and faithfulness in following God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_benjamin.htm">The Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for their skilled warriors.

In <a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>, the Lord previously raised up the left-handed Ehud from the same tribe of Benjamin, indicating a recurring pattern of God using what seems unusual to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;700&#8221; conveys completeness and notable strength; the text treats this number as literal, underscoring that true historical details matter to God&#8217;s record (cf. <a href="/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a>, precise census totals).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Select&#8221; speaks of rigorous selection&#8212;only the best of the best. Just as David later gathers &#8220;mighty men&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8&#8211;39</a>), Israel recognizes exemplary skill for strategic tasks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each of whom could sling a stone at a hair</b><p>&#8226; The sling was a common but potent weapon (<a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>). Hitting &#8220;a hair&#8221; illustrates pinpoint precision, celebrating human excellence guided by divine gifting (<a href="/exodus/35-31.htm">Exodus 35:31</a>).<p>&#8226; This picture anticipates later biblical moments where small projectiles accomplish great ends, such as David&#8217;s victory over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49</a>). God often delivers through what the world deems insignificant (<a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Skillful preparation does not negate faith; instead, it complements it. <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a> honors those &#8220;skilled in their work,&#8221; showing diligence glorifies the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>without missing</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Without missing&#8221; stresses unfailing accuracy, a trait ascribed to God Himself: &#8220;For the LORD&#8217;s word is upright, and all His work is trustworthy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-4.htm">Psalm 33:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase points to reliability in battle, reminding believers that consistency matters in service (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p>&#8226; When human precision mirrors divine faithfulness, it illustrates how God equips people to reflect His character of perfection (<a href="/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a> applied in vocation).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a> showcases a literal historical detail that also carries spiritual weight. From the mass of Israel&#8217;s warriors, God highlights 700 specially trained left-handed Benjamites whose flawless aim exemplifies excellence under His sovereign hand. Their existence affirms that the Lord values skill, intentional preparation, and faithful dependability. As with Ehud and David, God uses particular abilities&#8212;sometimes unexpected&#8212;to advance His righteous purposes, calling His people to combine diligent craftsmanship with unwavering trust in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Seven hundred chosen men.</span>--These words are omitted in the LXX. and Vulg.<p><span class= "bld">Left handed.</span>--The same phrase as that employed in <a href="/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Judges 3:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.</span>--The expression is perfectly simple, and merely implies extreme accuracy of aim.

Skill with the sling was not confined to the Benjamites, as we see from the case of David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm" title="And David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell on his face to the earth.">1Samuel 17:49</a>). The sling is the natural weapon of a people which is poor and imperfectly armed. Cyrus valued his force of 400 slingers (Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. iii.</span> 3-6). The inhabitants of the Balearic Isles were as skilful as the Benjamites, and children were trained to sling their breakfasts down from the top of high poles. They once prevented the Carthaginian fleet from coming to anchor by showers of stones (liv. xxviii. 37, <span class= "ital">solo eo telo utebantur</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Practice made them so expert that the stones they slung came with as much force as though hurled by a catapult, and pierced shields and helmets (Diod. Sic. <span class= "ital">Bibl. </span>v. 18). Exactly similar tales are told of the trained skill of our English archers. The advantage of slinging with the <span class= "ital">left </span>hand was very obvious, for it enabled the slinger to strike his enemy on the <span class= "ital">right, i.e., </span>the undefended side.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven hundred... men left-handed</span>. It is curious that the tribe of Benjamin, which means <span class="accented">son of the right hand</span>, should have this peculiar institution of a corps of left-handed men.

Diodorus Siculus (quoted by Rosenmuller) mentions the remarkable skill of the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands in the use of the sling, adding, in terms very similar to those of the text, that they seldom miss their aim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Among all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1500;
