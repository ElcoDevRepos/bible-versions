Having many sons was often seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). The number of sons and grandsons suggests a significant household, indicating prosperity and influence. This large family could also imply a strong political alliance, as family members often held positions of power or influence.<p><b>who rode on seventy donkeys</b><br>Riding on donkeys was a symbol of nobility and authority in the ancient Near East. Donkeys were considered valuable animals, and having many donkeys indicated wealth. This detail suggests that the judge's family was not only large but also affluent and respected. In biblical times, donkeys were used by judges and leaders, as seen with other judges like Jair (<a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>). This imagery contrasts with the use of horses, which were associated with war and foreign powers.<p><b>And he judged Israel eight years</b><br>The role of a judge in Israel was to lead and deliver the people, often from oppression, and to administer justice. The eight-year period of his judgeship suggests a time of relative stability and peace, as there is no mention of conflict during his tenure. This duration is shorter compared to some other judges, indicating a possible period of transition or lesser impact. The cyclical nature of the judges' leadership reflects Israel's recurring pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance, as seen throughout the Book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abdon.htm">Abdon</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Abdon was a judge of Israel.
