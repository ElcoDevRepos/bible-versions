This context highlights the spiritual decline in Israel during the time of the Judges, as Levites were often found outside their designated roles. The Levite's presence in this narrative underscores the chaotic and lawless period described in Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah</b><br>Bethlehem, meaning "house of bread," is significant in biblical history as the birthplace of King David and later Jesus Christ. This journey from Bethlehem indicates a movement from a place of provision and future messianic significance. The mention of Judah, the tribe from which David and Jesus would come, foreshadows the importance of this region in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>to the remote hill country of Ephraim</b><br>Ephraim was one of the prominent tribes of Israel, often representing the northern kingdom. The "remote hill country" suggests isolation and perhaps a lack of spiritual oversight, contributing to the moral and social decay evident in the narrative. This setting contrasts with the centrality of worship and community life intended for Israel.<p><b>where I am from</b><br>The Levite's origin in Ephraim connects him to a region known for its significant role in Israel's history, including the location of Shiloh, where the tabernacle was situated. This background emphasizes the Levite's deviation from his expected religious duties and the broader theme of Israel's spiritual waywardness.<p><b>I went to Bethlehem in Judah</b><br>This repetition of Bethlehem underscores its importance and the Levite's personal journey, which mirrors Israel's spiritual journey. The Levite's movement between these locations reflects the broader narrative of seeking provision and spiritual fulfillment, yet encountering moral and societal failure.<p><b>and now I am going to the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the tabernacle, the central place of worship for Israel. This phrase highlights the Levite's intended return to his religious duties, yet the narrative reveals the disconnect between intention and reality in Israel's spiritual life. It also foreshadows the eventual establishment of the temple in Jerusalem, a central theme in Israel's history.<p><b>but no one has taken me into his home</b><br>This statement reflects the lack of hospitality and community responsibility, which were vital aspects of Israelite culture. The absence of hospitality indicates the breakdown of societal norms and covenantal obligations, further illustrating the moral decline during the period of the Judges. This lack of welcome contrasts with the biblical ideal of welcoming strangers, as seen in Abraham's hospitality (Genesis 18) and the New Testament exhortation to show hospitality (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine and servant.

Its mention signals that the events are woven into God&#8217;s larger redemptive narrative.<p>&#8226; The wording recalls earlier travels &#8220;from Bethlehem&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-7.htm">Ruth 1:7</a>) and foreshadows later journeys involving Christ (<a href="/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>). God repeatedly works through ordinary trips to advance His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the remote hill country of Ephraim, where I am from</b><p>&#8226; The Levite identifies his true home, highlighting a common biblical tension between sojourning and belonging (<a href="/joshua/24-33.htm">Joshua 24:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Ephraim was central yet &#8220;remote,&#8221; stressing isolation within the nation when every tribe did what was right in its own eyes (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming Ephraim, the text recalls earlier Levite connections there&#8212;such as the wandering Levite of <a href="/bsb/judges/17.htm">Judges 17&#8211;18</a>&#8212;showing that priestly presence had not brought spiritual stability.<p>&#8226; God often raises questions of identity and covenant faithfulness through the backdrop of tribal lands (<a href="/joshua/21-20.htm">Joshua 21:20&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I went to Bethlehem in Judah</b><p>&#8226; Repetition underscores intentionality; the Levite&#8217;s journey was not random but purposeful (cf. <a href="/genesis/24-4.htm">Genesis 24:4&#8211;7</a>, where purposeful travel seeks covenant alignment).<p>&#8226; His earlier visit suggests family or contractual obligations, mirroring the social customs in <a href="/genesis/38-13.htm">Genesis 38:13&#8211;14</a> and <a href="/ruth/2-1.htm">Ruth 2:1</a>.<p>&#8226; The verse quietly indicts Bethlehem&#8217;s inhabitants: if hospitality had prevailed, perhaps this second leg of travel would be unnecessary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and now I am going to the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Literally pointing north toward Shiloh, where the tabernacle stood (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The Levite&#8217;s declaration sounds pious, yet the narrative&#8217;s irony warns against appearances without righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p>&#8226; His role affirms that worship was centralized, but Israel&#8217;s moral center had drifted. Even duty-bound worshipers could be caught in national apostasy (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly connects pilgrimage to divine encounter: <a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1</a>; <a href="/luke/2-41.htm">Luke 2:41&#8211;42</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but no one has taken me into his home</b><p>&#8226; A startling confession of societal breakdown.

Each phrase reveals a nation spiritually adrift: a Levite shuttling between Bethlehem and Ephraim, professing loyalty to the LORD yet unable to find simple hospitality. Geography highlights covenant roots; repetition stresses intentional yet futile attempts to find righteousness; the stated destination (&#8220;house of the LORD&#8221;) contrasts with the moral vacuum on Israel&#8217;s roads. The verse prepares us to witness the tragic consequences when God&#8217;s people ignore His commands on love, welcoming, and worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The side of mount Ephraim</span>.
