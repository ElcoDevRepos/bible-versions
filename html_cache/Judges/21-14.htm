This return marks a pivotal moment of reconciliation and restoration for the tribe. The timing is significant, as it follows a period of mourning and repentance by the Israelites, who realized the near extinction of one of their tribes. This reflects the cyclical nature of sin and redemption seen throughout the Book of Judges.<p><b>and were given the women who were spared from Jabesh-gilead</b><br>Jabesh-gilead was a city east of the Jordan River, in the territory of Gilead. The inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead had not participated in the assembly against Benjamin, leading to their punishment and the sparing of 400 virgins to provide wives for the Benjamites. This act, while controversial, was seen as a necessary measure to preserve the tribe of Benjamin. It highlights the complex interplay of justice and mercy in the Old Testament, as well as the communal responsibility of the Israelite tribes.<p><b>But there were not enough women for all of them</b><br>Despite the provision of women from Jabesh-gilead, the number was insufficient to ensure the survival of the entire tribe of Benjamin. This shortfall underscores the severity of the conflict and the desperate measures taken to rectify the situation. It also foreshadows the continued struggles and moral complexities faced by the Israelites, as they sought to maintain unity and identity in the Promised Land. This situation can be seen as a reflection of the broader theme of human insufficiency and the need for divine intervention, a theme that runs throughout the Bible and points to the ultimate
