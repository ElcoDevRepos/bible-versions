This sorrow is not just for the loss of life but for the potential extinction of an entire tribe, which would disrupt the divinely ordained structure of Israel. The Benjamites, despite their transgressions, are still considered brothers, highlighting the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness within the covenant community. This moment of grief can be compared to other instances in Scripture where Israel mourns for its people, such as the lament over Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-27</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Today a tribe is cut off from Israel.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "cut off" indicates a severe and potentially permanent separation, which in biblical terms often implies divine judgment or a significant breach in covenant relationship. The concern here is not only for the immediate loss but for the long-term implications on the nation of Israel, as each tribe had a specific role and inheritance in the Promised Land. The potential loss of Benjamin would mean a loss of part of Israel's identity and strength. This situation foreshadows the later division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign, where the unity of Israel is again threatened. Theologically, this reflects the consequences of sin and disobedience, as seen in the broader narrative of Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The cutting off of a tribe also echoes the warnings given in the law about the consequences of idolatry and unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18-21</a>).<div

when Israel wept after hearing the angel&#8217;s rebuke, and in <a href="/1_samuel/11-5.htm">1 Samuel 11:5&#8211;6</a> when the Spirit of God moved Saul to tears over Jabesh.<p>- Genuine grief acknowledges sin&#8217;s consequences; see <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a> for how godly sorrow produces repentance.<p>- The event follows the civil war of <a href="/bsb/judges/19.htm">Judges 19&#8211;20</a>, where Israel punished Benjamin for harboring wickedness. Their grief shows that discipline should never harden hearts against fellow believers (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for their brothers, the Benjamites</b><p>- Calling the Benjamites &#8220;brothers&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a>) underscores covenant family ties that remain even after conflict. <a href="/genesis/42-4.htm">Genesis 42:4</a> and <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> likewise stress familial bonds within God&#8217;s people.<p>- Brotherhood obligates compassion: &#8220;If one part suffers, every part suffers with it&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>).<p>- Though Benjamin&#8217;s actions demanded justice (<a href="/judges/20-12.htm">Judges 20:12&#8211;13</a>), kinship compelled Israel to seek restoration, mirroring Jesus&#8217; call to forgive seventy-seven times (<a href="/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>- Their spoken response moves grief into deliberate action. Words matter; <a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a> teaches that life and death are in the power of the tongue.<p>- Public acknowledgment of tragedy (<a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>) often precedes communal solutions. Here, verbal lament sets the stage for creative reconciliation plans in the rest of <a href="/bsb/judges/21.htm">Judges 21</a>.<p>- Speaking out also prevents silent bitterness (<a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>) and invites corporate ownership of the problem (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Today a tribe is cut off from Israel"</b><p>- The phrase captures the crisis: near extinction of Benjamin after only 600 men survived (<a href="/judges/20-47.htm">Judges 20:47</a>).<p>- Losing a tribe threatened covenant promises tied to all twelve tribes (<a href="/bsb/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4&#8211;8</a>).<p>- &#8220;Cut off&#8221; echoes warnings like <a href="/deuteronomy/29-21.htm">Deuteronomy 29:21</a>, yet here Israel realizes the permanence of annihilation would contradict God&#8217;s design for a complete nation (<a href="/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>- Their lament leads to mercy: they later provide wives for Benjamin (<a href="/judges/21-13.htm">Judges 21:13&#8211;23</a>), reflecting God&#8217;s heart to restore the fallen (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a> records Israel&#8217;s sincere sorrow when they grasp the full cost of punishing Benjamin. They weep because covenant brothers are nearly lost, speak their grief aloud, and recognize that erasing a tribe would fracture God&#8217;s ordained unity. The verse invites believers to hold justice and compassion together, mourning sin&#8217;s devastation while pursuing restoration so that no part of God&#8217;s family remains &#8220;cut off.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel</span>, etc. This verse goes back a little to explain why the children of Israel asked the question, viz., because they repented them for Benjamin, and wished to repair the mischief resulting from their rash oath not to give their daughters to a Benjamite; therefore they said (repeating ver. 5), What one is there that came not up to Mizpeh? (ver. 8) and on numbering the people it was found that no one had come up from Jabesh-gilead. This is the first time that <span class="cmt_word">Jabesh-gilead</span> is mentioned in Scripture. It comes up twice afterwards. First in <a href="/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>, on occasion of its being besieged by the Ammonites and rescued by Saul; and secondly in <a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>, when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shah, and buried them at Jabesh, for which brave and pious act David thanked them (<a href="/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a>). The name of <span class="accented">Jabesh</span> is only preserved in the Wady <span class="accented">Yabis</span>, which debouches on the eastern bank of the Jordan about lat. 32'24.
