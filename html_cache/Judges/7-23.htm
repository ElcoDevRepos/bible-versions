In the context of <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>, Gideon had just achieved a miraculous victory over the Midianites with only 300 men. The calling out of the men of Israel signifies a rallying of additional forces to capitalize on the victory. This reflects a common practice in ancient warfare where initial victories were often followed by a broader call to arms to ensure complete defeat of the enemy.<p><b>from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh</b><br>These tribes were located in the northern part of Israel, close to the area where the battle against the Midianites took place. Naphtali and Asher were situated near the Sea of Galilee, while Manasseh was a larger tribe with territory on both sides of the Jordan River. The inclusion of these tribes highlights their geographical proximity to the conflict and their vested interest in the outcome. Historically, these tribes often faced threats from northern invaders, making their participation crucial.<p><b>and they pursued the Midianites</b><br>The pursuit of the Midianites indicates a strategic follow-up to the initial victory. In ancient warfare, pursuing a retreating enemy was essential to prevent them from regrouping and counterattacking. This pursuit also fulfills God's promise of delivering the Midianites into Israel's hands, as seen earlier in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>. The Midianites were a nomadic people who had oppressed Israel, and their defeat was a significant turning point. This pursuit can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and evil, where the initial victory on the cross is followed by the ongoing pursuit of righteousness and the eventual complete eradication of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The judge chosen by God to deliver Israel from the oppression of the Midianites.
