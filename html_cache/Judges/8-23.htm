This reflects a pivotal moment in Israel's history, where the people sought a human leader to establish a monarchy, a common practice among neighboring nations. Gideon's reply is crucial in understanding his character and the theological themes of the book of Judges.<p><b>I will not rule over you</b><br>Gideon's refusal to become king highlights his recognition of God's sovereignty over Israel. This statement aligns with the theocratic ideal that God is the true King of Israel. It contrasts with the later establishment of the monarchy under Saul, which was a concession to the people's demands for a human king (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). Gideon's decision reflects a commitment to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God alone is the ruler.<p><b>nor will my son</b><br>By including his son in the refusal, Gideon emphasizes the rejection of dynastic rule, which was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This decision underscores the belief that leadership should not be based on hereditary succession but on divine appointment. It also foreshadows the eventual failure of Gideon's son Abimelech, who later attempts to establish himself as king, leading to chaos and destruction (Judges 9).<p><b>The LORD shall rule over you</b><br>This declaration reaffirms the central theme of divine kingship in the book of Judges. It echoes the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which calls for exclusive allegiance to God. The statement serves as a reminder of Israel's unique identity as a nation under God's direct rule, contrasting with the surrounding nations. It also points forward to the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingship in the person of Jesus Christ, who is recognized as the King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

This prevents Israel from shifting its trust from Divine leadership to human lineage (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement guards against nepotism and anticipates the tragedy of Abimelech, Gideon&#8217;s own son who later seizes power by violence (<a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; By excluding his son, Gideon mirrors the principle later spelled out in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>&#8212;that each person stands or falls by his own relationship to God, not by inherited privilege.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD shall rule over you</b><p>&#8226; Gideon re-centers national life on God&#8217;s kingship: &#8220;The LORD shall reign forever and ever&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s charter was always theocracy; God calls Himself &#8220;King over the whole earth&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/47-7.htm">Psalm 47:7</a>). Gideon&#8217;s words rehearse that truth.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a> combines the roles of judge, lawgiver, and king in the LORD alone. Gideon affirms the same, declaring that allegiance belongs to God, not a human throne.<p>&#8226; Practically, this summons the people to continual obedience to God&#8217;s word, as Moses had taught in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19</a>, rather than depending on a monarch&#8217;s edicts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Gideon&#8217;s threefold answer dismantles Israel&#8217;s push for a human king by (1) declining personal power, (2) refusing dynastic privilege, and (3) reasserting God&#8217;s exclusive right to rule. The verse teaches that true security and guidance come when a nation and its leaders submit to the Lord&#8217;s sovereign authority, not to human ambition or tradition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">The Lord shall rule over you.</span>--<a href="/numbers/23-21.htm" title="He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.">Numbers 23:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm" title="And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm" title="And the cows took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Bethshemesh.">1Samuel 6:12</a>. Gideon refused the splendid temptation of an hereditary crown, though, in strict accordance with Divine guidance, he was willing to be their judge ( <span class= "ital">Shaphat, </span>as in <a href="/context/judges/10-2.htm" title="And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.">Judges 10:2-3</a>; <a href="/judges/12-7.htm" title="And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.">Judges 12:7</a>, &c.). Cassel compares the remark of Washington when he accepted the Presidency, because he would "obey the voice of the people." saying that "no people could be more bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men than the people of the United States" (Marshall's <span class= "ital">Life of Washington, </span>2:146). The day anticipated in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/17-14.htm" title="When you are come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a> had not yet come. Up to this point "we feel all the goodness of Gideon. There is a sweetness and nobleness mingled with his courage, something of the past greatness of Joshua, something of the future grace of David." He reminds us in some respects of Henry Y. of England, and Henry IV. of France. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Gideon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(gi&#7695;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1439.htm">Strong's 1439: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gideon -- a judge of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
