Delilah's actions reflect the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines, a dominant theme in the Book of Judges. The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel during this period, often oppressing them. Delilah's call signifies the culmination of her deceit, as she had been bribed by the Philistine leaders to discover the secret of Samson's strength. This moment underscores the danger of personal relationships that compromise one's commitment to God.<p><b>When Samson awoke from his sleep,</b><br>Samson's sleep can be seen as symbolic of his spiritual complacency and vulnerability. Throughout his life, Samson had been set apart as a Nazirite, dedicated to God from birth (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). However, his repeated lapses in judgment, particularly in his relationships with Philistine women, illustrate a gradual spiritual decline. His physical sleep mirrors his spiritual slumber, where he fails to recognize the consequences of his actions and the seriousness of his covenant with God.<p><b>he thought, &#8220;I will escape as I did before and shake myself free.&#8221;</b><br>Samson's confidence in his ability to escape reflects his reliance on past experiences of deliverance rather than on God. This presumption is a critical flaw, as it shows his misunderstanding of the source of his strength. Previously, God had empowered Samson to defeat his enemies (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6, 15</a>:14-15), but Samson's repeated disobedience and disregard for his Nazirite vow led to a false sense of security. This moment serves as a warning against taking God's presence and power for granted.<p><b>But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.</b><br>This phrase is the crux of the passage, illustrating the tragic consequence of Samson's disobedience. The departure of the LORD signifies the loss of divine empowerment and protection. In the Old Testament, God's presence was often conditional upon obedience and faithfulness (Deuteronomy 28). Samson's ignorance of God's departure highlights his spiritual blindness and the severity of his situation. This moment foreshadows the ultimate need for a savior who would perfectly fulfill God's law and maintain His presence, pointing to Jesus Christ, who promises never to leave nor forsake His followers (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A Philistine woman who was used by the Philistine rulers to discover the secret of Samson's strength.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were enemies of Israel and sought to capture and subdue Samson.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite_vow.htm">Nazirite Vow</a></b><br>A special vow taken to set oneself apart for God, which included abstaining from cutting one's hair, consuming alcohol, and avoiding contact with dead bodies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose presence and power were the true source of Samson's strength.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Samson's account reminds us that our strength and abilities come from God.

The Philistines are literally waiting in the adjacent room, proving her betrayal has reached its final stage.<p>&#8226; This moment fulfills the escalating pattern seen earlier: every time Delilah pressed for Samson&#8217;s secret, she signaled the Philistines (<a href="/judges/16-6.htm">Judges 16:6&#8211;14</a>). Here, her call turns from rehearsal to reality.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us how sin often lures through repeated compromise. Like the nagging of Delilah, persistent temptation can dull spiritual alertness (cf. <a href="/proverbs/7-21.htm">Proverbs 7:21&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Samson ignored clear warning signs, we, too, can downplay danger when we entertain sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Samson awoke from his sleep, he thought, &#8220;I will escape as I did before and shake myself free.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Samson assumes that past victories guarantee present deliverance. Earlier, the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him and he broke free of new ropes &#8220;like flax&#8221; (<a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14</a>).<p>&#8226; His thinking reveals presumption: he trusts in his own history rather than in ongoing dependence on God. Compare Israel&#8217;s misplaced confidence in the ark in <a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3&#8211;11</a>.<p>&#8226; Spiritual complacency breeds overconfidence. Sleep becomes a picture of dullness (cf. <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11</a>). Samson wakes physically but remains unaware spiritually.<p>&#8226; He expects to &#8220;shake&#8221; himself loose&#8212;an echo of his former strength&#8212;yet he has severed the visible symbol of his Nazarite vow (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.</b><p>&#8226; The tragedy is not merely hair lost but presence lost. The LORD withdrawing parallels the Spirit&#8217;s departure from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s power had been the true source of Samson&#8217;s might (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>; 14:19). Without it, Samson is as weak as any man.<p>&#8226; This withdrawal is judicial, not arbitrary. Samson&#8217;s repeated violation of his vow (touching dead bodies, drinking at feasts, now shaving his head) culminates in forfeiting the covenant sign (<a href="/numbers/6-1.htm">Numbers 6:1&#8211;21</a>; <a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The text warns that outward gifts can remain for a season even while inward fellowship fades (<a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4&#8211;5</a>). Samson&#8217;s ignorance underscores how quietly spiritual decay can occur when sin is nurtured.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/16-20.htm">Judges 16:20</a> shows Delilah&#8217;s final betrayal, Samson&#8217;s presumptuous self-reliance, and the sobering reality that God&#8217;s empowering presence can depart when His covenant is despised. The verse calls readers to vigilance against compromise, humility instead of presumption, and a heartfelt dependence on the LORD whose presence is the true source of strength.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.</span>--A deeply tragic clause.

Samson was under a vow, but was, alas! too weak to resist the current which ran counter to his vow, particularly when he had come to rely on the mere external sign of it.
