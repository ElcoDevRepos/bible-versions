This greeting is significant in the context of ancient Israel, where hospitality was a deeply ingrained cultural value. The old man's offer of peace indicates his intention to provide protection and care, contrasting with the potential danger of the public square. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of peace as a divine blessing, seen in passages like <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where the Lord's peace is a sign of His favor.<p><b>&#8220;Let me supply everything you need.&#8221;</b><br>The old man's offer to supply everything needed highlights the cultural importance of hospitality in the ancient Near East. In a time when inns were rare and often unsafe, travelers relied on the kindness of strangers. This act of generosity is reminiscent of Abraham's hospitality to the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, where he provides for their needs. The old man's willingness to care for the traveler and his companions reflects the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>.<p><b>Only do not spend the night in the square.&#8221;</b><br>The warning against spending the night in the square underscores the potential danger and moral decay present in Gibeah, a town of the tribe of Benjamin. This cautionary advice foreshadows the tragic events that follow in the narrative, highlighting the lawlessness and lack of hospitality in Israel during the time of the Judges. The square, typically a place of gathering and commerce, becomes a symbol of vulnerability and threat. This situation parallels the story of Lot in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where he urges the angelic visitors not to stay in the city square of Sodom, indicating a similar environment of moral corruption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_man.htm">The Old Man</a></b><br>An elderly man from the hill country of Ephraim, residing in Gibeah, who offers hospitality to the traveling Levite, his concubine, and servant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Benjamin, where the events of <a href="/bsb/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a> unfold.
