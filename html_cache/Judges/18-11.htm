The number six hundred indicates a significant military force, suggesting a well-organized group prepared for conquest. This event occurs during the period of the Judges, a time characterized by a cycle of Israel's disobedience, oppression by enemies, cries for deliverance, and God raising up judges to save them. The Danites' actions here reflect their struggle to secure a territory, as they had not fully conquered their allotted land (<a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>).<p><b>departed from Zorah and Eshtaol</b><br>Zorah and Eshtaol were towns located in the Shephelah region of Judah, near the border of the Philistine territory. These towns are significant in the narrative of Samson, another Danite, who began to stir in this area (<a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>). The departure from these towns indicates a movement towards seeking new territory, as the Danites were unable to fully settle in their original inheritance due to pressure from the Amorites and Philistines (<a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>).<p><b>armed with weapons of war</b><br>The mention of being armed highlights the Danites' intention for military action. This preparation for battle underscores the violent and tumultuous nature of the period of the Judges, where tribal conflicts and warfare were common. The Israelites often found themselves in conflict with surrounding nations and even among themselves, as seen in this narrative. The use of weapons also reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual warfare, where believers are called to be spiritually armed (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/danites.htm">Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descendants of Dan, one of the twelve sons of Jacob.

They were also where &#8220;the Spirit of the Lord began to stir&#8221; Samson (<a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>), reminding us that this region had already witnessed both blessing and conflict.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Departed&#8221; signals abandonment of their God-given allotment (<a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>). Instead of trusting the Lord to help them possess it, they sought easier territory&#8212;an early warning that convenience was trumping obedience.<p>&#8226; Like Abram leaving Ur by faith (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>), their journey ought to have been a step of reliance on God. Yet, unlike Abram, the Danites never sought the Lord; they consulted a rogue Levite (<a href="/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5-6</a>), foreshadowing compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>armed with weapons of war</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that their mission was conquest, not peaceful settlement. Their armament contrasts with Israel&#8217;s earlier lack of metal weapons (<a href="/judges/5-8.htm">Judges 5:8</a>) and with Saul&#8217;s day when &#8220;no swords or spears were found&#8221; among the people (<a href="/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;armed&#8221; fits the pattern of self-reliance that threads through Judges (compare <a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>, where God reduced Gideon&#8217;s forces to display His power, not theirs).<p>&#8226; While God permits defensive warfare (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1-4</a>), the Danites here took up arms for an unauthorized migration, revealing hearts already drifting toward the later refrain: &#8220;Everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; 21:25).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the scene illustrates the contrast between earthly weapons and the &#8220;armor of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>). The tribe trusted steel; the Lord calls us to trust Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11</a> captures a pivotal moment: a small band from Dan left their homeland, sure of their swords but unsure of their God. They set out from familiar towns once touched by the Spirit, now trading heritage for convenience. Their readiness for battle exposed a reliance on human strength instead of divine promise. The verse stands as a sober reminder that God&#8217;s people thrive not by abandoning His assignments, nor by trusting earthly arms, but by staying where He plants them and depending wholly on Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Appointed.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">girded. </span>This was not a mere raid of warriors, but the migration of a section from the tribe, accompanied by their wives and children, and carrying their possessions with them (<a href="/judges/18-21.htm" title="So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.">Judges 18:21</a>).
