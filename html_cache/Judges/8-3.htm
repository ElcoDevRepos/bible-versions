Oreb and Zeeb were leaders of the Midianite forces, and their defeat signifies a turning point in the battle. The mention of God delivering them emphasizes the belief that victories are granted by divine will rather than human strength alone. This reflects the recurring biblical theme that God fights for Israel, as seen in other instances like the defeat of the Egyptians at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>). The Midianites were a nomadic people often in conflict with Israel, and their defeat here is part of the larger narrative of Israel's struggle to secure the Promised Land.<p><b>What was I able to do compared to you?&#8221;</b><br>Gideon, the speaker, uses this rhetorical question to deflect credit from himself and to elevate the achievements of the Ephraimites. This humility is a characteristic often expected of leaders in the biblical narrative, aligning with the idea that true leadership acknowledges the contributions of others. This phrase also serves to pacify the Ephraimites, who were upset for not being called earlier to the battle. It reflects a diplomatic approach to leadership, similar to how Moses dealt with disputes among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>).<p><b>When he had said this, their anger against him subsided.</b><br>The resolution of conflict through wise words is a common biblical motif. Gideon's response effectively calms the Ephraimites, demonstrating the power of humility and diplomacy. This moment underscores the importance of unity among the tribes of Israel, which is crucial for their survival and success. The subsiding of anger also reflects <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, which states, "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger." This incident highlights the need for leaders to possess not only military prowess but also the ability to maintain harmony within their community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
