It implies God's continued presence and potential for redemption, even when all seems lost.<p><b>the hair of his head</b><br>Samson's hair was the symbol of his Nazirite vow, a commitment to God that included abstaining from cutting his hair. This vow was a source of his supernatural strength. The mention of his hair specifically highlights the potential for restoration of his strength and his relationship with God. In biblical symbolism, hair can represent strength and vitality, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_corinthians/11-15.htm">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>, where hair is a covering and a sign of glory.<p><b>began to grow back</b><br>This phrase indicates a process of renewal and hope. It suggests that despite Samson's failure and the consequences of his actions, God is still at work. The regrowth of his hair symbolizes the possibility of spiritual renewal and the restoration of his strength. It serves as a reminder of God's grace and the potential for redemption, even after failure.<p><b>after it had been shaved.</b><br>The shaving of Samson's hair was a pivotal moment of betrayal and loss of strength, as it marked the breaking of his Nazirite vow. This act was performed by Delilah, who was used by the Philistines to discover the secret of his strength. The shaving signifies a period of weakness and separation from God's power. However, the fact that his hair began to grow back after being shaved indicates that God's purposes can still be fulfilled despite human failure. It foreshadows Samson's final act of strength and deliverance, as seen later in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was linked to his Nazirite vow and uncut hair.
