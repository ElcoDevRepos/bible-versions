The fact that each son rode on a donkey indicates a level of affluence, as donkeys were valuable animals used for transportation and carrying goods. This detail highlights the judge's influence and the stability of his rule. In the context of the Book of Judges, this period was marked by cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. The judge's ability to maintain such a large family and provide for them suggests a time of relative peace and prosperity under his leadership.<p><b>And they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead,</b><br>The reference to thirty towns indicates a significant territorial control and governance. Gilead was a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain. It was a strategically important area, often contested by neighboring tribes and nations. The control of thirty towns implies a well-organized and stable administration, which would have been necessary to maintain order and security in the region. This detail underscores the judge's effective leadership and the extent of his influence in Gilead.<p><b>which to this day are called Havvoth-jair.</b><br>The name Havvoth-jair, meaning "villages of Jair," connects this passage to earlier biblical history. Jair was a descendant of Manasseh who had previously captured and named these towns (<a href="/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>). The continuity of the name suggests a lasting legacy and the enduring impact of Jair's leadership. This phrase also indicates the historical reliability of the biblical narrative, as the towns retained their name up to the time of the writing of Judges. The preservation of the name reflects the importance of heritage and memory in Israelite culture, serving as a reminder of God's provision and the faithfulness of past leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jair.htm">Jair</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led for twenty-two years.
