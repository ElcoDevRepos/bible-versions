Historically, the Danites were known for their struggles to secure a permanent inheritance in the Promised Land. This context is crucial as it highlights their desperation and willingness to resort to aggressive measures. The Danites' actions in this chapter reflect a period of moral and spiritual decline in Israel, as described in the Book of Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>Do not raise your voice against us</b><br>This phrase indicates a warning and a demand for silence. It reflects the tension and potential for violence in the situation. The Danites are asserting their dominance and authority, which is a common theme in the tribal conflicts during the time of the Judges. This also shows a lack of respect for the rightful owner of the property they are seizing, highlighting the lawlessness of the period.<p><b>or angry men will attack you</b><br>The threat of violence is explicit here. The Danites are using intimidation to achieve their goals. This reflects the chaotic and often violent nature of the era, where might often made right. The reference to "angry men" suggests a readiness to use force, which is consistent with the broader narrative of Judges, where Israel frequently falls into cycles of sin and violence.<p><b>and you and your family will lose your lives</b><br>This phrase underscores the severity of the threat. The potential for loss of life indicates the high stakes involved in the Danites' quest for territory. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin and disobedience. The threat to the family unit is significant, as family was a central aspect of Israelite society. This mirrors the spiritual danger Israel faced when turning away from God, leading to destruction and loss.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel seeking a new territory for themselves.

Micah&#8217;s protests threatened to expose their sin, so they stifle him.<p>- The tactic mirrors the intimidation Eli&#8217;s corrupt sons used when worshipers challenged them (<a href="/1_samuel/2-16.htm">1 Samuel 2:16</a>).<p>- Scripture affirms that rebuke is necessary (<a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5-6</a>), yet these Danites reject correction, displaying the arrogance warned against in <a href="/proverbs/15-32.htm">Proverbs 15:32</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or angry men will attack you</b><p>- &#8220;Angry men&#8221; hints at a readiness to resort to mob violence. The tribe masks its intent behind an impersonal threat, though the anger is their own.<p>- Similar language surfaces when Saul&#8217;s troops justified disobedience with hunger-driven anger (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24-32</a>).<p>- The warning contradicts God&#8217;s command that vengeance belongs to Him alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). Here, anger is wielded as a weapon rather than surrendered to divine justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you and your family will lose your lives</b><p>- The threat extends beyond Micah to his household, revealing utter disregard for God&#8217;s prohibition of murder (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>).<p>- Destroying an entire family recalls the brutality of Simeon and Levi in Shechem (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25-26</a>) and foreshadows later bloodshed among Israelites, such as the massacre at Gibeah (<a href="/bsb/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>).<p>- Jesus later identifies such murderous anger as heart-level sin (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>), underlining that the Danites&#8217; words expose inward rebellion as well as outward violence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a> captures the spiritual chaos of Israel&#8217;s judges era: a tribe, meant to uphold God&#8217;s law, threatens lethal force to protect stolen idols. Each phrase reveals escalating hardness&#8212;silencing correction, invoking mob violence, and menacing murder. The verse stands as a sober warning that when God&#8217;s people reject His authority, self-interest breeds intimidation and bloodshed, but also as a call to cling to His Word, heed righteous rebuke, and entrust justice to the Lord rather than to angry men.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Lest angry fellows run upon thee.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">lest men bitter of soul fall upon thee. </span>(Comp. <a href="/judges/8-21.htm" title="Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us: for as the man is, so is his strength.
