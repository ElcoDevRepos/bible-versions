The sounding of the shofar was often a call to battle or a signal of divine intervention. In this context, the three hundred men under Gideon's command used the horns to create confusion and fear among the Midianite army. The number three hundred is symbolic of God's power working through a small, faithful remnant, as seen in other biblical narratives where God uses the few to achieve His purposes (e.g., David's mighty men).<p><b>the LORD set all the men in the camp against one another with their swords</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine intervention in the battle. The confusion and chaos that ensued among the Midianites were not due to the military prowess of Gideon's men but rather the direct action of the LORD. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God causes confusion among enemy forces, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a> with the Philistines. It underscores the theme that victory comes from the LORD, not human strength or numbers.<p><b>The army fled to Beth-shittah toward Zererah</b><br>Beth-shittah and Zererah are locations that are not precisely identified today, but they are believed to be in the region of the Jezreel Valley. The flight of the Midianite army in this direction indicates a retreat towards the east, away from the advancing Israelites. This movement reflects the panic and disorder that God instilled in the enemy camp, fulfilling His promise to deliver Israel from oppression.<p><b>as far as the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath</b><br>Abel-meholah is known as the birthplace of the prophet Elisha (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). It is located in the Jordan Valley, suggesting that the Midianites fled a considerable distance in their panic. The mention of Tabbath, though not well-documented archaeologically, serves to emphasize the extent of the Midianite retreat. This geographical detail highlights the completeness of the victory God provided, as the enemy was driven far from Israelite territory. The narrative serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness to His covenant people and His ability to deliver them against overwhelming odds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the Midianites.

In <a href="/context/psalms/83-13.htm" title="O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.">Psalm 83:13-14</a>, it is compared to the whirling flight of dry weeds before a rush of flame and wind, recalling the Arab imprecation, "May you be whirled like the akukb ('wild artichoke,' 'a wheel,' 'a rolling thing') before the wind, until you are caught in the thorns or plunged into the sea" (Thomson, <span class= "ital">Land and Book, </span>Judges 36).<p><span class= "bld">Beth-shittah.</span>--It should be rather, <span class= "ital">Beth hash-shit-tah, </span>"the house of the acacia"--a place named from the trees which are still abundant in that neighbourhood, just as we have such names as Burntash, Seven-oaks, Nine Elms, &c. (Comp. Abel-Shittim, <a href="/numbers/33-49.htm" title="And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even to Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.">Numbers 33:49</a>; Joshua 21.) If <span class= "ital">Beth hash-shittah </span>was the village <span class= "ital">Shultah, </span>with which Robinson (<span class= "ital">Bibl. Reg., </span>3:219) identifies it, some of the host must have fled northwards. It is improbable that it was another name for Beth-shean, though the LXX. have Bethsead in some MSS. It is, however, by no means unlikely that some of the marauders would fly towards the fords of the Jordan near Bethshean (comp. Jos. <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 6, ? 5), as others fled south to the fords near Succoth, which lay to the south of the Jabbok. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blew the trumpets</span>, etc. Hearing the confusion, the three companies blew their trumpets, probably more loudly than before, to give the impression of a hot pursuit being at hand. The Midianites, thinking the enemy were upon them, and not being able in the dark to distinguish friend from foe, mistook their flying comrades for pursuing Israelites, and fell upon and slew one another. In like manner the Philistines had done when attacked by Jonathan and his armour-bearer (<a href="/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>), and the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites when attacked by Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shittah</span>. House of acacias. The exact situation of it, and of Zererath and Tabbath, is unknown. They must have been villages lying on the route from the plain of Esdraelon to the banks of Jordan, probably between Little Hermon on the north and Mount Gilboa on the south, where there was a very ancient high road from Jezreel to the Jordan by Beth-sham Indeed it is highly probable that <span class="accented">Shuta</span>, a village mentioned by Robinson, marks the site, as it retains the name of Beth-shittah.
