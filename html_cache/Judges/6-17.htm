This encounter occurs during a time when Israel is oppressed by the Midianites. Gideon's response is significant as it shows his initial hesitation and need for reassurance, a common human reaction when faced with divine encounters.<p><b>If I have found favor in Your sight</b><br>This phrase reflects a common biblical theme where individuals seek confirmation of their standing before God. It echoes the language used by figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>), who also sought assurance of God's favor. It indicates Gideon's desire for validation and acceptance by God, which is crucial for his forthcoming mission.<p><b>give me a sign</b><br>The request for a sign is a recurring motif in the Bible, often associated with seeking confirmation of God's will or presence. Signs were used by God to communicate with His people, as seen with Moses and the burning bush (Exodus 3) or Hezekiah's sundial (<a href="/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8-11</a>). Gideon's request highlights his need for tangible evidence of divine interaction, reflecting human nature's struggle with faith and doubt.<p><b>that it is You speaking with me</b><br>Gideon seeks assurance that the message he receives is truly from God. This reflects the biblical principle of testing the spirits (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>) to discern divine truth. It underscores the importance of verifying divine communication, a practice seen throughout scripture, ensuring that the message aligns with God's character and purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, called by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

He is processing a divine call that feels far bigger than himself. Earlier he had politely questioned the Angel of the LORD about Israel&#8217;s suffering (<a href="/judges/6-13.htm">Judges 6:13</a>), yet the Lord did not rebuke him&#8212;evidence that honest dialogue with God is welcomed. Like Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>), Gideon now answers with cautious openness, revealing a heart ready to listen yet still wrestling with doubts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If I have found favor in Your sight</b><p>Gideon appeals to grace before he asks for confirmation. &#8220;Favor&#8221; echoes the language of Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12&#8211;17</a>), reminding us that any calling we receive is grounded in divine kindness, not personal merit (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>). Gideon senses that God&#8217;s favor is what will carry him through the impossible task of liberating Israel from Midian. His words acknowledge dependency, much like Mary&#8217;s humble &#8220;May it be to me according to your word&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Give me a sign</b><p>Rather than stubborn unbelief, Gideon seeks assurance that he is truly hearing God. Scripture consistently shows the Lord granting signs to strengthen faith: the rainbow for Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a>), the staff-turned-serpent for Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-1.htm">Exodus 4:1&#8211;5</a>), and the fire on Mount Carmel for Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36&#8211;39</a>). Gideon will later ask for the fleece signs (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36&#8211;40</a>), but this first request establishes the pattern&#8212;God patiently meets His servants where they are, building confidence step by step (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That it is You speaking with me</b><p>The heart of Gideon&#8217;s plea is certainty that the message originates from the LORD. Discerning God&#8217;s voice matters, because obedience hangs on that assurance (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). Gideon is not seeking entertainment but validation that his commanding officer is indeed the Almighty (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>). The Lord answers by waiting while Gideon prepares an offering and then consuming it with fire (<a href="/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19&#8211;21</a>), a clear sign reminiscent of God&#8217;s acceptance of Elijah&#8217;s sacrifice and of Samson&#8217;s parents&#8217; offering (<a href="/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19&#8211;20</a>). Once convinced, Gideon builds an altar and names it &#8220;The LORD Is Peace&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-24.htm">Judges 6:24</a>), marking a turning point from fear to faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/6-17.htm">Judges 6:17</a> captures Gideon&#8217;s transition from uncertainty to budding trust. He respectfully engages God, appeals to grace, requests a confirming sign, and seeks assurance that the command truly comes from the LORD.
