In the broader context of <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>, the Levite had been staying with his concubine's father for several days. The Levite's decision to depart reflects the cultural practice of hospitality, where guests were often encouraged to stay longer. This moment also highlights the transient nature of life during the period of the Judges, where travel was common due to the decentralized tribal society.<p><b>but his father-in-law persuaded him</b><br>The father-in-law's persuasion is a reflection of the Near Eastern custom of hospitality, which was highly valued. This act of persuasion can be seen as a form of social obligation, where the host seeks to honor the guest by extending their stay. It also underscores the father-in-law's desire to maintain familial bonds and perhaps ensure the well-being of his daughter, the Levite's concubine. This interaction can be compared to other biblical instances of hospitality, such as Abraham's reception of the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>.<p><b>so he stayed there that night</b><br>The Levite's decision to stay another night demonstrates the effectiveness of the father-in-law's persuasion and the cultural weight of hospitality. This delay sets the stage for the subsequent events in Gibeah, which are pivotal in the narrative of <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the importance of timing and divine providence in biblical narratives, where seemingly small decisions can lead to significant outcomes. The concept of staying or delaying is seen in other biblical stories, such as Lot's hesitation to leave Sodom in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, which also had profound consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine.

Here, the Levite&#8217;s standing up signals a responsible step toward protecting his household and returning to priestly service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but his father-in-law persuaded him</b><p>&#8226; Middle Eastern culture prized hospitality; the host&#8217;s honor increased by prolonging a guest&#8217;s stay (<a href="/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3-5</a>; <a href="/luke/24-29.htm">Luke 24:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The father-in-law&#8217;s urging had already succeeded twice (<a href="/judges/19-5.htm">Judges 19:5-6, 8</a>), reflecting warm affection but also the social weight of a host&#8217;s invitation.<p>&#8226; The persuasion shows how personal relationships can redirect plans&#8212;sometimes wisely (<a href="/proverbs/27-9.htm">Proverbs 27:9</a>), sometimes with unintended results (<a href="/1_kings/13-18.htm">1 Kings 13:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The Levite listens, demonstrating deference to elder counsel (<a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17-24</a>) and a desire to maintain peace within the family.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so he stayed there that night</b><p>&#8226; The immediate outcome seems harmless: another evening of fellowship, food, and rest (<a href="/judges/19-8.htm">Judges 19:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the delay means setting out late the next day, forcing an overnight stop in Gibeah&#8212;the scene of the chapter&#8217;s tragic events (<a href="/judges/19-14.htm">Judges 19:14-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often notes how small choices shape larger destinies (<a href="/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1-5</a>; <a href="/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-39</a>). Here, accepting extended hospitality positions the Levite for a testing he could not foresee.<p>&#8226; Still, God&#8217;s sovereign purposes unfold through human decisions (<a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>), even when those decisions appear ordinary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/19-7.htm">Judges 19:7</a> records a simple moment&#8212;standing to leave, being urged to stay, and yielding for one more night.
