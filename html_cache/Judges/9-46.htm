Abimelech, the son of Gideon, had been made king by the people of Shechem but later turned against them. The phrase indicates a reaction to a specific event, likely the destruction of the city or the killing of its inhabitants, which is detailed earlier in the chapter. This highlights the fear and urgency among the leaders upon realizing the threat posed by Abimelech.<p><b>all the leaders in the tower of Shechem</b><br>The "leaders" here are the prominent men or rulers of Shechem, a city with significant historical and biblical importance. Shechem was a central location in the land of Israel, situated in the hill country of Ephraim. The "tower" refers to a fortified structure within the city, often used as a place of refuge during attacks. This reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of having a stronghold within a city for protection against invaders.<p><b>entered the inner chamber</b><br>The "inner chamber" suggests a place of safety or a sanctuary within the tower. In ancient times, such chambers were often used as a last resort for protection during sieges. This action indicates the leaders' desperation and their attempt to find security from Abimelech's assault. The use of an inner chamber also implies a sense of sacredness or inviolability, as these areas were often associated with religious or ceremonial functions.<p><b>of the temple of El-berith</b><br>El-berith, meaning "God of the Covenant," was a deity worshiped in Shechem. The temple served as both a religious and communal center. The reference to El-berith connects to the broader theme of covenant in the Bible, contrasting the people's allegiance to a pagan god with the covenant relationship Israel was supposed to have with Yahweh. This temple's existence highlights the syncretism present in Israel during the time of the Judges, where foreign gods were often worshiped alongside Yahweh. The leaders' retreat to this temple underscores their reliance on false security and misplaced faith, which ultimately leads to their downfall, as Abimelech later destroys the tower.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_in_the_tower_of_shechem.htm">Leaders in the Tower of Shechem</a></b><br>These were the prominent figures or rulers residing in Shechem, a significant city in the tribal territory of Ephraim.
