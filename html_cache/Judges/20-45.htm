The "wilderness" refers to the desolate and rugged terrain east of the central hill country of Israel, often a place of refuge or escape. The "rock of Rimmon" is a specific location, likely a natural fortress or high place, providing a strategic defensive position. This reflects the desperation and tactical retreat of the Benjamites, seeking safety in a familiar and defensible location. The rock of Rimmon is mentioned again in <a href="/judges/20-47.htm">Judges 20:47</a>, indicating its significance as a place of refuge.<p><b>and Israel cut down 5,000 men on the roads</b><br>The phrase "cut down" indicates a decisive and violent confrontation. The roads were likely the main routes of escape, suggesting that the Israelites had anticipated the Benjamites' retreat and strategically positioned themselves to intercept them. This reflects the intensity and brutality of the conflict, as well as the determination of the Israelite forces to bring judgment upon the Benjamites for their transgressions. The number 5,000 signifies a significant loss, emphasizing the scale of the battle and the severity of the punishment.<p><b>And they overtook them at Gidom and struck down 2,000 more</b><br>The location "Gidom" is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, indicating it may have been a minor or temporary landmark known to the original audience. The pursuit and additional slaughter of 2,000 Benjamites highlight the relentless nature of the conflict and the thoroughness of the Israelite campaign. This relentless pursuit can be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment, as the Israelites sought to eradicate the sin from their midst. The total number of casualties underscores the tragic consequences of sin and disobedience within the covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, known for their skilled warriors.
