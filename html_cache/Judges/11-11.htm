This reflects the recurring biblical theme of God using unlikely individuals to fulfill His purposes, similar to David's rise from shepherd to king. Gilead, a region east of the Jordan River, was known for its balm and rugged terrain, often serving as a refuge and a place of strategic importance.<p><b>and the people made him their leader and commander</b><br>Jephthah's appointment as leader and commander signifies a formal recognition of his authority, despite his past rejection. This mirrors the biblical pattern of God elevating the humble and those rejected by society, as seen in Joseph's rise to power in Egypt. The dual role of leader and commander indicates both civil and military authority, essential for the impending conflict with the Ammonites.<p><b>And Jephthah repeated all his terms in the presence of the LORD at Mizpah</b><br>Jephthah's repetition of terms before the LORD at Mizpah underscores the solemnity and religious significance of his leadership. Mizpah, a site of assembly and covenant-making, is historically significant as a place where Israel gathered for important decisions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7</a>. This act of repeating terms before God highlights the theocratic nature of Israel's leadership, where divine approval and guidance are sought. It also foreshadows Jephthah's later vow, emphasizing the importance of vows and oaths in Israelite culture, and serves as a reminder of the need for integrity and accountability before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A mighty warrior and the son of Gilead, Jephthah was initially rejected by his family due to his mother being a prostitute.

There are, indeed, no limits to the possible irregularities of these disturbed times, during which the priests seem to have sunk into the completest insignificance.

And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.">Judges 10:17</a>) is in Gilead. Nor is it at all likely that the High Priest would have carried the sacred Urim into the disturbed and threatened Eastern districts.

And this must be the meaning of the expression here. Jephthah was installed at the national place of gathering and consultation for Gilead, viz., at Mizpah in Gilead, into his office as bead of the State, and there, as in the capital, he performed all his duties under the sanctions of religion. Whether, however, the ark was brought there, or the altar, or a priest with an ephod, or whether some substitute was devised which the unsettled times might justify, it is impossible to say from want of information. There seems to be some reference in the words to Jephthah's vow, in ver. 31, as one of such utterances. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Jephthah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yip&#772;&#183;t&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3316.htm">Strong's 3316: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jephthah -- 'He opens', a Gileadite, also a city of Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
