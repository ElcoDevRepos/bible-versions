It reflects the seriousness of the message delivered by the angel of the Lord to Manoah's wife. The carefulness required suggests a need for vigilance and obedience, highlighting the sanctity of the vow that is to be undertaken.<p><b>not to drink wine or strong drink</b><br>This prohibition is part of the Nazirite vow, a special commitment to God described in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>. Wine and strong drink were common in ancient Israelite culture, often used in celebrations and religious rituals. Abstaining from them was a sign of dedication and separation unto God. This restriction foreshadows the life of Samson, who was to be set apart from birth for God's purposes.<p><b>and not to eat anything unclean</b><br>The dietary laws in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> outline what is considered clean and unclean for the Israelites. This command emphasizes the importance of ritual purity and obedience to God's law. It also underscores the distinctiveness of Samson's calling, as he was to be consecrated from the womb. This mirrors the call to holiness seen in other biblical figures, such as John the Baptist, who also lived under a Nazirite-like vow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah's_wife.htm">Manoah's Wife</a></b><br>The unnamed wife of Manoah, who receives the angelic message about the birth of Samson.
