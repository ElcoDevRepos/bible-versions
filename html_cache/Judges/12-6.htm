The term "Shibboleth" means "stream" or "ear of grain" in Hebrew. The use of a word as a password underscores the cultural and dialectical differences between the tribes of Israel. This incident reflects the tensions and divisions within the Israelite confederation during the period of the Judges, a time marked by tribal conflicts and a lack of centralized leadership.<p><b>If he said, &#8220;Sibboleth,&#8221; because he could not pronounce it correctly,</b><br>The inability to pronounce "Shibboleth" correctly reveals the distinct dialect of the Ephraimites, who pronounced it as "Sibboleth." This linguistic difference served as a marker of identity, similar to how accents and dialects can distinguish groups today. The Ephraimites' failure to pronounce the word correctly led to their identification and subsequent execution, illustrating the severe consequences of tribal rivalries.<p><b>they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan.</b><br>The fords of the Jordan were strategic crossing points, making them ideal locations for controlling movement between territories. The Gileadites' control of these fords allowed them to intercept fleeing Ephraimites. This act of seizing and killing highlights the brutal nature of inter-tribal conflicts during this era. The Jordan River often served as a boundary and a place of significant events in Israel's history, such as the crossing into the Promised Land under Joshua.<p><b>So at that time 42,000 Ephraimites were killed.</b><br>The large number of Ephraimite casualties underscores the scale of the conflict and the intensity of the animosity between the tribes. This event reflects the broader theme of disunity and strife within Israel during the time of the Judges, a period characterized by cycles of sin, oppression, deliverance, and peace. The number 42,000 also serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of internal division and the need for unity among God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led the Gileadites in battle against the Ephraimites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraimites.htm">Ephraimites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel who were in conflict with the Gileadites, leading to a civil war.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gileadites.htm">Gileadites</a></b><br>The people led by Jephthah, who were victorious over the Ephraimites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fords_of_the_jordan.htm">Fords of the Jordan</a></b><br>The crossing points of the Jordan River where the Gileadites tested the Ephraimites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shibboleth/sibboleth.htm">Shibboleth/Sibboleth</a></b><br>A word used as a linguistic test to identify the Ephraimites, who could not pronounce it correctly.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>The account of Shibboleth illustrates how words can be used to distinguish and divide.
