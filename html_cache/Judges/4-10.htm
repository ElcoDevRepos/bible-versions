These tribes were located in the northern region of Israel, which was under significant oppression from Jabin, the king of Canaan. The choice of these tribes highlights their strategic location and their willingness to respond to the call for deliverance. Historically, these tribes were known for their valor and were often involved in military campaigns (<a href="/genesis/49-13.htm">Genesis 49:13, 21</a>). This summoning reflects the unity and cooperation among the tribes during times of crisis, a recurring theme in the Book of Judges.<p><b>Ten thousand men followed him,</b><br>The number ten thousand signifies a substantial force, indicating the seriousness of the threat posed by Sisera and the Canaanites. This number also suggests a divinely orchestrated plan, as God often uses specific numbers to fulfill His purposes (e.g., Gideon's 300 men in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>). The willingness of these men to follow Barak demonstrates their faith in God's deliverance and their trust in Barak's leadership. This gathering of troops is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God raises an army to achieve His purposes, such as the Israelites' exodus from Egypt.<p><b>and Deborah also went with him.</b><br>Deborah, a prophetess and judge of Israel, accompanied Barak, signifying her role as a spiritual and moral leader. Her presence underscores the importance of divine guidance in Israel's military endeavors. Deborah's involvement is significant as it highlights the role of women in God's plan, challenging cultural norms of the time. Her leadership is a type of Christ, as she acts as an intercessor and deliverer for her people. Deborah's presence with Barak also fulfills her prophetic word that the victory would be attributed to a woman, foreshadowing the role of Jael later in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barak.htm">Barak</a></b><br>A military leader from the tribe of Naphtali, called by God through Deborah to lead an army against the Canaanite oppressors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel, who provided spiritual and strategic leadership during a time of oppression.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebulun_and_naphtali.htm">Zebulun and Naphtali</a></b><br>Two tribes of Israel that responded to Barak's call to arms, demonstrating unity and obedience to God's command.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kedesh.htm">Kedesh</a></b><br>A city of refuge in the territory of Naphtali, serving as the gathering place for Barak's army.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/ten_thousand_men.htm">Ten Thousand Men</a></b><br>The number of soldiers from the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali who followed Barak into battle, signifying a significant mobilization of Israelite forces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_call.htm">Obedience to God's Call</a></b><br>Barak's response to Deborah's summons demonstrates the importance of obeying God's call, even when the task seems daunting.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_among_believers.htm">Unity Among Believers</a></b><br>The cooperation between the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali highlights the power of unity in achieving God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_women_in_god's_plan.htm">Role of Women in God's Plan</a></b><br>Deborah's leadership role underscores the significant contributions women can make in God's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The willingness of ten thousand men to follow Barak into battle exemplifies faith in action, trusting God for victory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_leadership.htm">God's Presence in Leadership</a></b><br>Deborah's presence with Barak symbolizes God's guidance and assurance in leadership roles.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_4_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 4:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Barak_inspire_your_faith.htm">How does Barak's obedience in Judges 4:10 inspire your own faith actions?

Like Gideon later calling Manasseh and Asher (<a href="/judges/6-35.htm">Judges 6:35</a>), the Lord often stirs specific believers to lead the wider community in obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ten thousand men followed him</b><p>&#8226; The number underscores both faith and dependence: 10,000 is sizeable, yet far outmatched by Sisera&#8217;s 900 iron chariots (<a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>). The scene echoes Gideon&#8217;s eventual 300 (<a href="/judges/7-6.htm">Judges 7:6-7</a>), illustrating that victory rests on God, not human might (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Followed him&#8221; indicates voluntary commitment. These men are not conscripts but willing soldiers&#8212;a pattern echoed when David&#8217;s mighty men &#8220;volunteered to serve&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Their immediate response contrasts sharply with the hesitation of tribes like Reuben and Dan who &#8220;remained by the ships&#8221; (<a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15-17</a>). God honors prompt, united action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Deborah also went with him</b><p>&#8226; Deborah&#8217;s presence fulfills her earlier promise (<a href="/judges/4-9.htm">Judges 4:9</a>) and signals divine endorsement of the campaign. Like Moses holding up his staff while Joshua fought (<a href="/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10-13</a>), her accompanying role blends spiritual authority with military action.<p>&#8226; Her willingness models servant-leadership: she &#8220;arose&#8221; as a mother in Israel (<a href="/judges/5-7.htm">Judges 5:7</a>), refusing comfort while God&#8217;s people faced oppression.<p>&#8226; The joint leadership of Deborah and Barak illustrates complementary service&#8212;Deborah providing prophetic direction, Barak executing strategy&#8212;mirroring the partnership of Paul and Barnabas in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/4-10.htm">Judges 4:10</a> shows swift, faith-filled obedience. Barak calls the exact tribes God named; 10,000 volunteers rally despite daunting odds; Deborah steps forward to reinforce God&#8217;s word in person. The verse reminds us that when God speaks, His people must unite, respond immediately, and trust Him to deliver, even when numbers and circumstances seem inadequate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Called.</span>--The word used is the technical word for summoning an army (<a href="/context/2_samuel/20-4.htm" title="Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be you here present.">2Samuel 20:4-5</a>). Naturally Zebulun and Naphtali would be more difficult to arouse than the central tribes, because, though they felt the oppression most, they would have to bear the brunt of the vengeance in case of defeat. Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="/judges/5-14.htm" title="Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after you, Benjamin, among your people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.">Judges 5:14</a>), being more strong and secure, could raise their contingents without the personal help of Deborah, especially if that view of the chronology be admissible which avoids other difficulties by the difficult supposition that this event took place before the death of Joshua.<p><span class= "bld">Zebulun and Naphtali.</span>--(See <a href="/judges/5-18.htm" title="Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that risked their lives to the death in the high places of the field.">Judges 5:18</a>.)
