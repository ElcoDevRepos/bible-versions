The Spirit of the LORD coming upon individuals is seen with other judges like Othniel (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>) and Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>). This empowerment signifies God's approval and presence, enabling Jephthah to fulfill his role as a deliverer of Israel. It highlights the necessity of divine intervention for success in Israel's battles.<p><b>and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh</b><br>Gilead and Manasseh were regions east of the Jordan River. Gilead was known for its balm, a healing ointment, and was a significant area for the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. This movement through Gilead and Manasseh suggests Jephthah's rallying of support and troops from these territories, emphasizing the unity and cooperation needed among the tribes of Israel to face external threats.<p><b>then through Mizpah of Gilead</b><br>Mizpah of Gilead was a significant gathering place for the Israelites, often associated with covenant-making and military assembly (<a href="/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>). The name Mizpah means "watchtower," indicating a place of strategic importance. This location served as a rallying point for Jephthah's forces, underscoring the communal aspect of Israel's defense efforts.<p><b>And from there he advanced against the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and frequent adversaries of Israel. Their conflict with Israel often revolved around territorial disputes and historical grievances. Jephthah's advance against the Ammonites marks the beginning of a divinely sanctioned military campaign. This action reflects the cyclical pattern in Judges of Israel's apostasy, oppression by enemies, crying out to God, and deliverance through a judge. Jephthah's leadership and the Spirit's empowerment are crucial for Israel's deliverance from Ammonite oppression.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and vow.

It implies, as R. Tanchum rightly says, that he was endowed with the courage and wisdom without which success would have been impossible.
