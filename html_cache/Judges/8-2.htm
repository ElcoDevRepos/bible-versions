His response here is to the men of Ephraim, who were upset for not being called earlier to fight. This reflects a common theme in Judges where tribal tensions and rivalries are evident. Gideon's diplomatic response is a model of humility and wisdom, defusing potential conflict.<p><b>&#8220;Now what have I accomplished compared to you?</b><br>Gideon downplays his own achievements to elevate the contributions of the Ephraimites. This rhetorical question emphasizes the importance of unity and collaboration among the tribes of Israel. It also highlights the biblical principle of valuing others above oneself, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>.<p><b>Are not the gleanings of Ephraim</b><br>The term "gleanings" refers to the leftover crops after the main harvest, which were often collected by the poor. Here, it metaphorically represents the smaller, yet significant, victories of Ephraim. This phrase underscores the idea that even what seems minor can be of great value, a theme echoed in the parable of the mustard seed in <a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>.<p><b>better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?</b><br>Abiezer was Gideon's own clan within the tribe of Manasseh. The comparison between Ephraim's gleanings and Abiezer's harvest suggests that Ephraim's achievements, though seemingly less significant, are actually greater.

He was not in a condition, even had he wished it, to humble the fierce jealousy of this kindred tribe, as the more independent Jephthah, who was not so closely bound to them, did not scruple to do. He remembered that Zebah and Zalmunna were still safe; the Midianites were as yet by no means finally crushed. Patriotism as well as right feeling demanded that at such a moment there should be no civil discord.<p><span class= "bld">Is not the gleaning . . .?</span>--The answer has a proverbial sound. (Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-21.htm" title="When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.">Deuteronomy 24:21</a>.) It here implies that Ephraim, by a mere subsequent and secondary effort, had achieved more (as yet) than Gideon himself had done, or perhaps that the two bloody heads which were their "gleaning" were better than the "vintage" of obscure thousands. In admitting this, in waiving all self-assertion, Gideon was setting an example of the spirit which is content to suffer wrong, and to take less than its proper due (<span class= "ital">elassousthai, </span>Time. i. 77). Nor was there any irony or wilful sacrifice of truth in his remark, for there can be no doubt that the Ephraimites had wrought a splendid victory (<a href="/isaiah/10-26.htm" title="And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a whip for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was on the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:26</a>). The Chaldee renders it, "Are not the weak of the house of Ephraim better than the strong of the house of Abiezer?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What have I done</span>, etc. Gideon's character comes out splendidly in this answer. Humble and unassuming (<a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15, 36</a>, note), and indisposed to glory, he was willing to give the Ephraimites full credit for their share in the great victory; prudent, and a lover of his country, he saw the immense importance of union among themselves, and the danger of intestine divisions and discord, and so at once met Ephraim's taunts by the soft answer which turneth away wrath (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The grapes</span>. The insertion of the word <span class="accented">grapes</span>, which is not in the Hebrew, rather spoils the proverb. It would run better, The gleaning of Ephraim is better than the vintage of Abi-ezer. The word <span class="accented">vintage</span> sufficiently shows that the <span class="accented">gleaning</span> meant was a gleaning of grapes. Ephraim, who came in at the end of the fight, like the gleaner when the vintage is finished, had got more glory by the capture of Oreb and Zeeb than the Manassites, who had gone through the whole campaign. The passage above referred to in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>) implies that a great slaughter of the Midianites took place at the rock of Oreb. <p> CHAPTER 8:4-12 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But he said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
