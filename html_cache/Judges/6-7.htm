This pattern of crying out to God is recurrent throughout the Book of Judges, highlighting a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. The Israelites often turned to God when faced with overwhelming adversity, acknowledging their dependence on Him. This cry is a form of repentance, a turning back to God after a period of disobedience and idolatry. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God responds to the genuine repentance of His people.<p><b>because of Midian</b><br>The Midianites were a nomadic people who oppressed Israel during this period. Historically, the Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, as mentioned in <a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>. Their oppression of Israel involved raiding and plundering, which left the Israelites impoverished and in fear. This oppression was a direct consequence of Israel's disobedience to God, as they had turned to worship other gods, violating the covenant. The Midianite oppression serves as a backdrop for the rise of Gideon, whom God would raise as a deliverer. The mention of Midian also connects to earlier biblical narratives, such as Moses' time in Midian, providing a rich historical and theological context.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are suffering under the oppression of the Midianites due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who hears the cries of His people and responds to their distress.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that oppressed the Israelites, causing them to cry out to God for deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/crying_out.htm">Crying Out</a></b><br>This event marks a turning point where the Israelites, in their desperation, seek divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppression.htm">Oppression</a></b><br>The context of this verse is the severe oppression faced by the Israelites, which leads them to repentance and seeking God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>The Israelites' cry to God signifies a moment of repentance.
