The timing suggests a sense of urgency and determination among the Israelites to seek justice. Morning often symbolizes new beginnings or divine intervention in biblical narratives, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where God's mercies are new every morning.<p><b>the Israelites set out</b><br>The Israelites, representing the twelve tribes, are acting in unity, a rare occurrence in the period of the Judges, which was marked by tribal disunity and moral decline. This collective action underscores the severity of the crime in Gibeah and the need for a unified response. The setting out signifies a mobilization for battle, reflecting the seriousness of their mission.<p><b>and camped near Gibeah.</b><br>Gibeah, a city in the territory of Benjamin, is central to the narrative. Its geographical location is significant as it was a Benjamite city, and the crime committed there had national implications. The Israelites camping near Gibeah indicates a strategic positioning for confrontation. This act of encampment is reminiscent of military campaigns in the Old Testament, such as the Israelites' encampment before the battle of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>. The proximity to Gibeah also highlights the tension and impending conflict between the Israelites and the tribe of Benjamin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who are preparing for battle against the tribe of Benjamin due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin where a horrific crime was committed against a Levite's concubine, leading to a civil war within Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite's_concubine.htm">The Levite's Concubine</a></b><br>Her abuse and death at the hands of the men of Gibeah sparked outrage and led to the assembly of the Israelite tribes against Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_benjamin.htm">The Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, which defended the men of Gibeah, leading to conflict with the other tribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_at_mizpah.htm">The Assembly at Mizpah</a></b><br>Prior to the events of <a href="/judges/20-19.htm">Judges 20:19</a>, the Israelites gathered at Mizpah to decide on a course of action against Benjamin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The Israelites' response to the sin in Gibeah underscores the importance of addressing sin within the community.
