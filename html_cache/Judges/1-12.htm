His faithfulness is rewarded with a leadership role in the tribe of Judah. Caleb's actions here reflect his continued commitment to securing the land for his people.<p><b>&#8220;To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it,</b><br>Kiriath-sepher, also known as Debir, was a Canaanite city located in the hill country of Judah. The task of capturing it was significant, as it represented the ongoing conquest of the Promised Land. This challenge reflects the military and strategic efforts required to establish Israelite control over Canaan. The offer of a reward for capturing the city indicates the importance of this conquest and the need for courageous leaders.<p><b>I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.&#8221;</b><br>Offering a daughter in marriage as a reward was a common practice in ancient times, often used to forge alliances and reward bravery. Acsah's marriage would not only be a personal union but also a political alliance, strengthening ties within the tribe of Judah. This practice is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as when Saul offers his daughter to David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17-27</a>).
