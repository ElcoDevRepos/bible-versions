His approach signifies a divinely orchestrated mission. The act of approaching a king required courage and divine assurance, reflecting God's empowerment of His chosen deliverers.<p><b>while he was sitting alone</b><br>The king's solitude indicates a moment of vulnerability, both physically and spiritually. In ancient Near Eastern culture, kings often had private quarters for rest and reflection, which were considered secure. This setting underscores the element of surprise and divine intervention in Ehud's mission.<p><b>in the coolness of his upper room</b><br>Upper rooms were typically used for privacy and comfort, often built to catch the breeze. This detail highlights the king's complacency and false sense of security. The "coolness" may symbolize a false peace, contrasting with the impending judgment.<p><b>&#8220;I have a word from God for you,&#8221;</b><br>Ehud's declaration is a bold proclamation of divine authority. In biblical narratives, a "word from God" often precedes significant events or judgments. This phrase connects to the prophetic tradition where God's messengers deliver His will, as seen with prophets like Samuel and Nathan.<p><b>Ehud said, and the king rose from his seat.</b><br>The king's rising signifies respect and attention to a divine message, a common cultural response to perceived divine communication.

Ehud, God&#8217;s appointed deliverer, moves with deliberate faith toward an unsuspecting tyrant cocooned in luxury. By invoking a &#8220;word from God,&#8221; Ehud disarms Eglon&#8217;s suspicions and secures the king&#8217;s respectful rise&#8212;positioning him for the swift judgment that follows.

The expression reminds us that the scene of the incident is placed in the Ghor--the Jordan valley, which lies nearly a thousand feet below the level of the Mediterranean, and is probably the hottest district in the world. Eglon had retired into this room after the public reception of the present, and Ehud had anticipated this as part of his deeply-laid design.<p><span class= "bld">Which he had for himself alone.</span>--Rather, "in his solitude." The words merely mean (as in the LXX. and Vulg.) that he was sitting alone.<p><span class= "bld">I have a message from God unto thee.</span>--Josephus makes him say that he had a dream to impart to Eglon, by command of God. The whole narrative implies that Ehud was, to some extent, an honoured person even among the Moabites. Probably he was reckoned as a prophet. In the East sacred claims are readily conceded, even to enemies. The Mohammedans received St. Francis of Assisi with entire respect.<p><span class= "bld">He arose out of his seat.</span>--Probably out of reverence, to receive the Divine message, which would naturally be delivered in low and reverent tones. "He rose from his throne (and came) near him" (LXX.). Josephus says that he "leaped out of his throne for joy of the dream." Thus Cimber pressed close upon Caesar (Plut. <span class= "ital">C?s. </span>86), and Cleander upon Parmenio (Curt. 72, 27) (Cassel).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For himself alone</span>.
