In the context of Judges, this empowerment is often for deliverance or leadership. The Spirit's coming upon Gideon marks a pivotal moment where God equips him for the mission of delivering Israel from Midianite oppression. This divine empowerment is seen in other judges, such as Othniel (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>) and Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>), highlighting a pattern where God raises leaders through His Spirit. This foreshadows the New Testament outpouring of the Holy Spirit on believers, empowering them for ministry (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>who blew the ram&#8217;s horn</b><br>The blowing of the ram's horn, or shofar, is a call to action, often used in Israel for assembling troops or signaling the start of a battle (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). It serves as a rallying cry, indicating urgency and divine sanction. The shofar's use here signifies Gideon's transition from a hesitant individual to a leader mobilizing Israel for God's purpose. The shofar is also associated with significant events in Israel's history, such as the giving of the Law at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>), and is used in eschatological contexts, symbolizing God's intervention in human affairs (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>).<p><b>and rallied the Abiezrites behind him</b><br>The Abiezrites were a clan within the tribe of Manasseh, to which Gideon belonged (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>). This rallying indicates a shift in Gideon's status among his people, from a man hiding in fear to a leader commanding respect and allegiance. The Abiezrites' support is crucial, as they are his immediate kin and the first to respond to his call. This local support is foundational for the broader coalition Gideon will later assemble. The transformation of Gideon's relationship with his clan reflects the broader theme of God using the weak and unlikely to achieve His purposes, a theme echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

The Spirit&#8217;s arrival confirms that Gideon&#8217;s obedience, though timid, positioned him to receive greater empowerment (<a href="/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who blew the ram&#8217;s horn</b><p>&#8226; The ram&#8217;s horn&#8212;shofar&#8212;was the ancient alarm, summoning people to battle or worship (<a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; By sounding it, Gideon publicly signals faith that God will act, moving from private obedience to open leadership (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The shofar blast often marked God&#8217;s intervention on behalf of His people (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12&#8211;15</a>). Gideon aligns his call with that tradition, trusting the same God to intervene again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and rallied the Abiezrites behind him</b><p>&#8226; The Abiezrites were Gideon&#8217;s own clan within Manasseh (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>). Earlier they were ready to kill him for toppling Baal&#8217;s altar, yet now they stand with him.<p>&#8226; Their change of heart illustrates how the Spirit&#8217;s work softens opposition and forges unity (<a href="/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>; <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>).<p>&#8226; God often begins revival at home.

Empowered from above, Gideon sounds the trumpet of faith, and those who once doubted rally to him. The verse reminds us that when God&#8217;s Spirit initiates, our obedience&#8212;however small&#8212;becomes the spark that gathers others for His deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Came upon Gideon.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">clothed Gideon. </span>See <a href="/judges/3-10.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.">Judges 3:10</a> (Othniel); <a href="/judges/11-29.htm" title="Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.">Judges 11:29</a> (Jephthah); <a href="/judges/13-25.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.">Judges 13:25</a> (Samson).
