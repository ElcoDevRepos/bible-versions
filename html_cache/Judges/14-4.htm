It underscores the theme of God's sovereignty, where He uses even the flawed decisions of individuals to fulfill His purposes. This is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where God's plans are hidden from human understanding, such as Joseph's story in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where what was meant for evil, God used for good. It also reflects the mystery of God's will, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than human comprehension.<p><b>who was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines</b><br>This indicates God's intention to use Samson as an instrument of judgment against the Philistines, who were oppressing Israel. The Philistines were a significant threat during this period, known for their advanced military technology, including iron weapons. This context is crucial for understanding the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance in the Book of Judges. God's seeking an occasion suggests His proactive role in delivering Israel, similar to how He raised up other judges like Ehud and Deborah to deliver His people.<p><b>for at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel</b><br>This provides the historical context of the narrative, where the Philistines had established dominance over Israel. The Philistine oppression is a recurring theme in the Book of Judges, highlighting Israel's failure to fully obey God's command to drive out the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27-36</a>). This period of Philistine rule is part of the larger cycle of disobedience and deliverance that characterizes the era of the judges. It sets the stage for Samson's role as a judge and deliverer, albeit a flawed one, pointing to the need for a perfect deliverer, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.

The spiritual lethargy that accompanied such rule called for decisive divine intervention.<p>&#8226; By linking Samson&#8217;s story to national bondage, the text reminds us that personal circumstances can be part of God&#8217;s wider plan to liberate His people (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a> reveals God&#8217;s unseen hand guiding Samson&#8217;s controversial choice to marry a Philistine woman.

The verse underscores God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty: He can employ even imperfect desires to initiate deliverance for His people, demonstrating that His purposes stand firm regardless of human understanding or enemy strength.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">That it was of the Lord.</span>--All that can be meant is that in this marriage God was overruling the course of events to the furtherance of His own designs.
