It follows the events where Abimelech, the son of Gideon, had been made king by the people of Shechem. The timing is significant as it shows the unfolding of Abimelech's plans and the consequences of his leadership. The "next day" implies a sense of immediacy and urgency in the narrative.<p><b>the people of Shechem</b><br>Shechem was a significant city in ancient Israel, located in the hill country of Ephraim. It was a center of trade and politics, and its people played a crucial role in the story of Abimelech. Historically, Shechem was a place of covenant renewal for Israel (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>) and had deep spiritual and cultural significance. The people of Shechem had previously supported Abimelech's rise to power, but their loyalty was complex and ultimately unstable.<p><b>went out into the fields</b><br>This action suggests a return to normal agricultural activities, which were central to the economy and survival of ancient communities. The fields around Shechem would have been vital for sustenance and trade. The phrase may imply a false sense of security among the people, unaware of the impending threat from Abimelech. It also highlights the agrarian lifestyle of the time, where daily life was closely tied to the land.<p><b>and this was reported to Abimelech</b><br>The reporting to Abimelech indicates a network of communication and possibly espionage. It shows that Abimelech had informants or loyalists who kept him informed of the movements and activities of the people. This intelligence would have been crucial for Abimelech to maintain control and execute his plans. The phrase underscores the tension and mistrust between Abimelech and the people of Shechem, setting the stage for the conflict that follows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.
