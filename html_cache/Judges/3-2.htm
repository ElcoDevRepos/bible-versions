God allowed these nations to remain to teach the Israelites the art of warfare. This reflects a practical need for military preparedness in a land surrounded by hostile nations. It also serves as a spiritual metaphor for the Christian life, where believers are called to be spiritually vigilant and prepared for spiritual battles (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<p><b>to the subsequent generations of Israel</b><br>The focus here is on the future generations who had not experienced the conquest of Canaan under Joshua. This highlights the importance of passing down skills and knowledge to ensure the survival and faithfulness of the nation. It underscores the biblical principle of generational teaching, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children.<p><b>especially to those who had not known it formerly</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the new generation had not experienced the previous wars and victories. It suggests a gap in experience and knowledge that needed to be addressed. Historically, this reflects the cyclical nature of Israel's faithfulness and forgetfulness, as seen throughout the book of Judges. Spiritually, it serves as a reminder of the need for each generation to have its own encounters with God and to learn reliance on Him, much like the personal faith journey required of each believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who orchestrates events for His purposes, including teaching the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, God's chosen people, who are being prepared for warfare.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, where they must learn to defend themselves and maintain their inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding peoples in Canaan, left by God to test and teach the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_preparation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Preparation</a></b><br>God uses circumstances, even challenging ones, to prepare His people for future tasks.
