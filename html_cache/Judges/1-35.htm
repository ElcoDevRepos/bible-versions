Their determination to dwell in these areas highlights the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and the native Canaanite populations. Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim were strategically located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Dan, but the Danites struggled to fully possess it due to the strong Canaanite presence. This reflects the broader theme in Judges of incomplete conquest and the Israelites' failure to fully obey God's command to drive out the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/joshua/13-13.htm">Joshua 13:13</a>). The persistence of the Amorites in these locations also foreshadows future conflicts, as these areas were significant for trade and military routes.<p><b>But when the house of Joseph grew in strength,</b><br>The "house of Joseph" refers to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, descendants of Joseph, who were among the more powerful tribes in Israel. Their growing strength indicates a period of consolidation and increased military capability. This growth can be attributed to God's blessing and fulfillment of His promises to the patriarchs, as seen in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where Jacob prophesies that Ephraim would become a multitude of nations. The strengthening of the house of Joseph is a reminder of God's faithfulness to His covenant people, even amidst their struggles and failures.<p><b>they pressed the Amorites into forced labor.</b><br>Instead of completely driving out the Amorites as commanded (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>), the Israelites chose to subject them to forced labor. This decision reflects a compromise with the surrounding culture and a failure to fully trust in God's provision and commands. The use of forced labor is a recurring theme in Israel's history, seen later in Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-21</a>), and often leads to negative consequences, such as the influence of pagan practices and idolatry. This compromise foreshadows the cyclical pattern of disobedience and oppression found throughout the book of Judges, where Israel's failure to fully obey God leads to their own subjugation by foreign powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of ancient people living in Canaan, often in conflict with the Israelites.
