The detail emphasizes the completeness of the act, suggesting Ehud's determination and the divine empowerment behind his mission. The act of the handle sinking in signifies the totality of the judgment against Eglon, a Moabite king oppressing Israel. This event is a turning point, symbolizing the deliverance of Israel from Moabite domination.<p><b>and Eglon&#8217;s fat closed in over it</b><br>Eglon's obesity is mentioned to underscore the decadence and corruption of his reign. In ancient Near Eastern culture, obesity in a ruler could symbolize excess and indulgence, contrasting with the lean, oppressed Israelites. This detail also serves to highlight the miraculous nature of Ehud's victory, as it was not through conventional strength or military might but through cunning and divine intervention.<p><b>so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his belly</b><br>Ehud's decision not to retrieve the sword may indicate the urgency of his escape or the completeness of his mission. It also reflects the irreversible nature of God's judgment on Eglon. This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of the finality of divine justice, where once God's will is enacted, it is absolute and unchangeable.<p><b>And Eglon&#8217;s bowels emptied</b><br>This graphic detail serves to underscore the humiliation and total defeat of Eglon. In the cultural context, such a description would highlight the disgrace of the king, as bodily functions were often associated with shame. This moment also signifies the purging of evil and corruption from Israel, as Eglon's death leads to the liberation of the Israelites. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where the enemies of God's people are utterly defeated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed judge of Israel from the tribe of Benjamin, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Moabite oppression.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eglon.htm">Eglon</a></b><br>The king of Moab, who oppressed Israel for eighteen years.

God had empowered Ehud (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>) just as He later empowered Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>); physical strength and courage are repeatedly presented as gifts from the LORD when He raises a deliverer (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail of the entire weapon disappearing highlights the completeness of the judgment against Eglon, comparable to the &#8220;thorough&#8221; overthrow of Pharaoh&#8217;s army in the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Eglon&#8217;s fat closed in over it</b><p>&#8226; The narrative does not shy away from physical description; instead, it reinforces the idea that the oppressor&#8217;s own excess and pride become instruments of his downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The image calls to mind <a href="/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6&#8211;9</a>, where the arrogant are described as having &#8220;pride as their necklace&#8221; and &#8220;the imaginations of their hearts run wild.&#8221; Eglon&#8217;s literal corpulence mirrors spiritual arrogance.<p>&#8226; That the sword is swallowed by his body illustrates visually what <a href="/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a> states: &#8220;The righteousness of the blameless directs their path, but the wicked fall by their own wickedness.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his belly</b><p>&#8226; Ehud&#8217;s refusal or inability to retrieve the sword indicates urgency; he prioritizes escape and the larger mission of rallying Israel (<a href="/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>) over personal property. Compare the haste of David when fleeing Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/20-38.htm">1 Samuel 20:38&#8211;40</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene also fulfills God&#8217;s pattern of making a complete end of oppressors (<a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>). Ehud leaves the weapon behind because the victory is already assured; no additional striking is necessary, reminiscent of Joshua leaving the sun&#8211;standing miracle unfinished because the battle was won (<a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds readers that deliverance often requires letting go of personal assets for a greater purpose (<a href="/luke/5-11.htm">Luke 5:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Eglon&#8217;s bowels emptied</b><p>&#8226; This final detail signals death&#8217;s certainty.

Every phrase&#8212;handle, fat, unwithdrawn sword, emptied bowels&#8212;demonstrates that the LORD&#8217;s deliverance is thorough, unassailable, and final, encouraging believers to trust His decisive intervention when He raises a deliverer for His covenant people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">The haft also went in after the blade.</span>--The tremendous violence of the blow marks that resoluteness of character which Ehud shows throughout. The Hebrew for "blade" is "flame," as the LXX. here render it. It is as though the vivid narrator would make us see the flash of the dagger ere it is buried, hilt and all, in the huge body. So in <a href="/nahum/3-3.htm" title="The horseman lifts up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcasses; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble on their corpses:">Nahum 3:3</a> we have, "The horseman lifteth up the flame of the sword and the lightning of the spear." The only other passage where the word occurs is to describe the polished head of the spear of Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm" title="And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.">1Samuel 17:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">So that he could not draw the dagger out.</span>--Thus he had disarmed himself by the force of his own blow; but the original only says, "for he did not draw the dagger out."<p><span class= "bld">And the dirt came out.</span>--The meaning of this clause is excessively doubtful, because the Hebrew word rendered "dirt" (<span class= "ital">parsedonah</span>) occurs here and here only. (1) Our E.V. follows the Chaldee and the Vulgate with the alternative rendering (2) "it came out at the fundament" (<span class= "ital">marg.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which is the view of Gesenius. The Jews were themselves uncertain of the meaning and even in Rabbi Tanchum's commentary we find that some understood it to mean (3) "he (Ehud) ran out into the gallery." (4) A fourth guess--that of the Syriac version--is, "he went out hastily." The LXX. omit it altogether, either because they thought that they were consulting propriety--a tendency which they constantly show--or because they could not rightly explain it. The resemblance of the word <span class= "ital">parsedonah </span>to the word <span class= "ital">misder?nah </span>("porch"), in the next clause, is certainly in favour of its meaning some part of the house. Ewald renders it, "he rushed out into the gallery," which runs round the roof. He refers to <a href="/ezekiel/42-5.htm" title="Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.">Ezekiel 42:5</a>. To understand it more exactly, we should require to know the structure of the house. Following the analogy of other Eastern houses, as described by Shaw, it seems that Eglon's <span class= "ital">alijah </span>was a separate building (<span class= "ital">domation, </span>Jos.), or part of a building, with one door opening on a balcony, and another on a private staircase and closet (<a href="/judges/3-24.htm" title="When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he covers his feet in his summer chamber.">Judges 3:24</a>). It was an <span class= "ital">inner </span>room, and its outer door communicated with the house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The haft</span>, etc. Ehud, feeling the necessity of killing Eglon at one blow, plunged the dagger into his body with such force that the handle went in with the blade, and he was unable to draw it out. Leaving it, therefore, buried in his fat, he <span class="accented">went out</span> at once into the <span class="accented">parshedon</span>, or antechamber, for so it is best to render the last words of the verse, and thence into the <span class="accented">misederon</span>, the outer porch, having first locked the door of the summer chamber. The words <span class="accented">parshedon</span> and <span class="accented">misederon</span> occur only here, and the former is very variously rendered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1463;&#1469;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the handle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;ni&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
