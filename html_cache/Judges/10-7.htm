Throughout the Book of Judges, Israel's cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is evident. The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme, highlighting God's holiness and justice. This anger is not arbitrary but a response to Israel's covenant unfaithfulness. The burning anger signifies intense divine displeasure, reminiscent of God's response to sin in other parts of Scripture, such as the golden calf incident in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>.<p><b>and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and Ammonites</b><br>The phrase "He sold them" suggests a relinquishing of protection, allowing Israel to fall under foreign domination as a consequence of their sin. This is a judicial act, reflecting the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience. The Philistines and Ammonites were perennial enemies of Israel, representing external threats that God used to discipline His people. The Philistines were a seafaring people settled along the coastal plains, while the Ammonites were located east of the Jordan River. This dual oppression from both west and east underscores the severity of Israel's predicament. The historical context reveals that these oppressors were significant military powers during this period, making Israel's subjugation particularly harsh. This situation sets the stage for the rise of judges like Jephthah and Samson, who would deliver Israel from these oppressors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose anger is kindled due to Israel's disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who repeatedly fall into cycles of sin, idolatry, and repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A neighboring people and frequent adversaries of Israel, known for their military strength and oppression of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>Another neighboring group, often in conflict with Israel, who also oppress them during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>The leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression, though not directly mentioned in this verse, they are central to the context of the book.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's anger is a direct response to Israel's idolatry and disobedience.

That long list of idols shows how completely they deserted Him. The Lord&#8217;s anger is not a flare-up of temper but a holy, covenant-keeping response to betrayal (see <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-14</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40-41</a>). Think of a faithful spouse watching the other run into repeated affairs&#8212;love demands jealousy. This burning anger exposes sin, protects the holiness of God, and sets in motion discipline designed to bring His people back (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines</b><p>&#8220;Sold&#8221; is the same verb used earlier in <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>; 3:8; 4:2&#8212;language from the marketplace picturing Israel handed over like a slave whose owner has forfeited every right. By withdrawing His shield, the Lord allows the Philistines from the coastal plain to dominate large portions of Israel, paving the way for stories like Samson&#8217;s (<a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>). The oppression was God-supervised discipline, not random misfortune. It fulfilled warnings such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a> and was intended to wake the nation up (<a href="/1_samuel/12-9.htm">1 Samuel 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He sold them into the hands of the Ammonites</b><p>At the same time oppression struck from the east.

God sometimes allows more than one hardship at once so we cannot explain trouble away as coincidence (<a href="/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a>; <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>).

By &#8220;selling&#8221; Israel to both Philistines and Ammonites, He lovingly disciplines His people, stripping away false securities until they run back to Him.
