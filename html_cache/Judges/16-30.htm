His willingness to die with the Philistines shows a sacrificial aspect, reminiscent of Christ's sacrifice. This phrase also highlights the theme of divine justice, as Samson seeks to fulfill God's purpose even in his death. The Philistines, long-time oppressors of Israel, are central to the narrative of Judges, representing the pagan cultures that Israel was commanded to drive out.<p><b>Then he pushed with all his might,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Samson's physical strength, which was a gift from God. Despite his previous failures, Samson's final act is one of faith, as he relies on God to restore his strength. This act of pushing symbolizes a return to his divine calling as a judge of Israel. The strength given to Samson can be seen as a type of the power of the Holy Spirit, enabling believers to accomplish God's will.<p><b>and the temple fell on the lords and all the people in it.</b><br>The temple of Dagon, the Philistine god, was a place of idolatry and pagan worship. Its destruction signifies the triumph of the God of Israel over false gods. The lords of the Philistines were the ruling class, and their death represents a significant blow to Philistine power. This event fulfills the prophecy that Samson would begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p><b>So in his death he killed more than he had killed in his life.</b><br>Samson's greatest victory came at the cost of his own life, drawing a parallel to Christ's victory over sin and death through His crucifixion. This phrase underscores the theme of redemption, as Samson's final act brings about a greater deliverance for Israel than all his previous exploits. It also serves as a reminder of the potential for God to use flawed individuals to achieve His purposes, pointing to the ultimate redemption found in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.

This cry is more than resignation; it is a final appeal to the LORD who had just answered him (<a href="/judges/16-28.htm">Judges 16:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson embraces the cost of standing against God&#8217;s enemies, willing to surrender his own life&#8212;echoing the principle of laying down one&#8217;s life for others (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>).<p>&#8226; His words mark a moment of repentance and renewed faith (<a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32-34</a>), showing that even after failure, turning to God can restore purpose.<p>&#8226; Samson recognizes Israel&#8217;s battle is ultimately God&#8217;s;

The collapse of Dagon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-4</a> anticipates another humiliating fall of this idol) is a tangible judgment on Philistine idolatry (<a href="/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God vindicates His name in the very place where His enemy was being celebrated; vengeance belongs to Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;lords&#8221; represent oppressive power structures; their simultaneous downfall underscores that no ruler can stand against God (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s liberation begins here, paving the way for future judges and kings who will finish subduing the Philistines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So in his death he killed more than he had killed in his life.</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55-57</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s story encourages believers that apparent defeat can be the gateway to God&#8217;s greatest triumphs (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226;
