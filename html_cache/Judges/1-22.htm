These tribes were significant in the history of Israel, often taking a leading role in the conquest and settlement of Canaan. Joseph's sons were blessed by Jacob, and Ephraim was given prominence over Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-13.htm">Genesis 48:13-20</a>). This phrase highlights the unity and collective action of these tribes in fulfilling God's command to possess the land.<p><b>also attacked Bethel</b><br>Bethel, meaning "house of God," was a significant city in the central hill country of Canaan. It held historical importance as a place where Abraham and Jacob had encounters with God (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8, 28</a>:19). The attack on Bethel signifies the continuation of the conquest of Canaan, as commanded by God. Archaeological evidence suggests Bethel was a fortified city, making its capture a strategic victory for the Israelites. The city's religious significance and its location on a major trade route made it a key target.<p><b>and the LORD was with them</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine assistance and approval of the Israelites' actions. The presence of the LORD with the house of Joseph indicates that their efforts were in alignment with God's will, fulfilling His promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This divine support is a recurring theme in the conquest narratives, as seen in Joshua's leadership (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament promise of God's presence with believers (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>), highlighting the continuity of God's faithfulness throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_joseph.htm">House of Joseph</a></b><br>This refers to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, descendants of Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob.

Their inheritance in central Canaan was already outlined in <a href="/bsb/joshua/16.htm">Joshua 16&#8211;17</a>, yet significant strongholds remained unconquered. God&#8217;s mandate to drive out the nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>) still stood, so these tribes step forward in obedience. Earlier victories&#8212;such as Jericho and Ai under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1-2</a>)&#8212;had shown them that faithful action brings God&#8217;s provision.<p>Key reminders:<p>&#8226; God ties His promises to specific families (<a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24</a>), so the &#8220;house of Joseph&#8221; moves with covenant confidence.<p>&#8226; Their identity is inseparable from God&#8217;s larger redemptive plan (<a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Attacked Bethel</b><p>Bethel, formerly Luz (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>), lay on a vital north&#8211;south ridge route. It was once the place where Jacob met God, set up a stone pillar, and named it &#8220;House of God.&#8221; By <a href="/bsb/judges/1.htm">Judges 1</a>, however, Canaanite occupants defiled that sacred history. Obedience required action: &#8220;They went up against Bethel&#8221; (<a href="/judges/1-23.htm">Judges 1:23</a>). Notice the practical steps recorded in verses 23-25:<p>&#8226; Spies surveyed the city, echoing Joshua&#8217;s earlier reconnaissance at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; A local man revealed an entrance, reminiscent of Rahab&#8217;s aid; mercy was extended to him and his family (<a href="/judges/1-25.htm">Judges 1:25</a>), proving that God&#8217;s justice and compassion can operate side by side.<p>Attacking Bethel reaffirmed that holy places belong to the Lord, not to idolatry (<a href="/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the LORD was with them</b><p>The decisive clause explains their success: &#8220;the LORD was with them.&#8221; Scripture repeatedly links victory to God&#8217;s presence, not military skill (<a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>).
