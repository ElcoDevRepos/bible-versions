The speaker is the Levite, who is traveling with his concubine and servant. This continuation implies a decision-making process, highlighting the urgency and necessity of finding shelter before nightfall.<p><b>&#8220;Come,</b><br>The invitation "Come" is a call to action, emphasizing the need for unity and cooperation among the travelers. It reflects the Levite's leadership role and his responsibility for the safety of his companions.<p><b>let us try to reach</b><br>The phrase "let us try to reach" suggests a sense of urgency and determination. It indicates the travelers are aware of the dangers of traveling at night, especially in a time when lawlessness was prevalent in Israel, as described in the broader context of the Book of Judges.<p><b>one of these towns</b><br>The reference to "one of these towns" indicates the proximity of multiple settlements, offering potential refuge. This reflects the tribal allotments in the land of Israel, where towns were often close to one another, providing options for travelers.<p><b>to spend the night</b><br>Spending the night in a town was a common practice for travelers seeking safety and hospitality. In ancient Near Eastern culture, hospitality was a significant social obligation, and townspeople were expected to offer shelter to strangers.<p><b>in Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah was a town in the territory of Benjamin. It later becomes infamous for the events that unfold in this chapter, leading to a civil war in Israel. Gibeah's mention here foreshadows the tragic events that will occur, highlighting the moral decline in Israel during this period.<p><b>or Ramah.&#8221;</b><br>Ramah was another town in the territory of Benjamin, located near Gibeah. It was a significant location in Israel's history, later becoming the home of the prophet Samuel. The choice between Gibeah and Ramah underscores the Levite's desire to find a safe haven, unaware of the impending danger in Gibeah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine and servant.
