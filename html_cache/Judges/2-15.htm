The Israelites faced opposition and defeat in various locations, reflecting their disobedience to God's commands. Historically, this period follows the conquest of Canaan, where Israel was supposed to fully occupy the land. However, due to incomplete obedience, they faced ongoing conflicts with remaining Canaanite tribes. This phrase underscores the consequences of not fully adhering to God's instructions.<p><b>the hand of the LORD was against them</b><br>The "hand of the LORD" is a biblical metaphor for God's power and intervention, whether for blessing or judgment. Here, it signifies divine opposition due to Israel's covenant unfaithfulness. This concept is consistent with the Deuteronomic theology, where blessings and curses are contingent on Israel's obedience (Deuteronomy 28). Theologically, it highlights God's active role in the affairs of His people, enforcing the covenant terms.<p><b>to bring calamity</b><br>Calamity refers to the various forms of distress and disaster that befell Israel, including military defeats, oppression by surrounding nations, and internal strife. This aligns with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where God warned of such consequences for disobedience. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the reality of divine justice.<p><b>just as He had sworn to them</b><br>This phrase points to the faithfulness of God in upholding His word, both in promises and warnings. The reference to God's oath underscores the binding nature of the covenant. Historically, this reflects the conditional aspects of the Mosaic Covenant, where blessings and curses were clearly stipulated. It also serves as a reminder of God's unchanging nature and the reliability of His word.<p><b>So they were greatly distressed</b><br>The distress experienced by Israel is both physical and spiritual, resulting from their separation from God's favor. This distress is a recurring theme in the Book of Judges, where Israel's cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is evident. It foreshadows the need for a righteous deliverer, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who provides ultimate deliverance from sin and its consequences. Theologically, it illustrates the human condition apart from God's grace and the need for repentance and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were delivered from Egypt and brought into the Promised Land.
