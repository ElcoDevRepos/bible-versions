Lighting the torches signifies the beginning of his plan to cause destruction. Fire is often used in the Bible as a symbol of judgment and purification (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).<p><b>and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines</b><br>The use of foxes (or possibly jackals, as the Hebrew word can mean either) is significant. Foxes were common in the region, and their release into the fields would cause chaos and destruction. This act of releasing them into the standing grain symbolizes a direct attack on the Philistine economy and sustenance, as grain was a staple food source.<p><b>burning up the piles of grain and the standing grain</b><br>The destruction of both the harvested and unharvested grain indicates a comprehensive devastation. This act would have had severe economic repercussions for the Philistines, as it destroyed both immediate and future food supplies. The burning of grain can be seen as a form of divine retribution, as fire often represents God's judgment (e.g., Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>).<p><b>as well as the vineyards and olive groves</b><br>Vineyards and olive groves were valuable agricultural assets in ancient Israel and Philistia, providing wine and oil, essential for daily life and religious practices. The destruction of these resources would have been a significant blow to the Philistines, affecting their economy and way of life. This act of destruction can be seen as a precursor to the ultimate deliverance of Israel from Philistine oppression, foreshadowing the complete victory that God would eventually bring through David and ultimately through Jesus Christ, who is the true deliverer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.

We may imagine him watching the trails of fire from his rocky fastness, and exulting as the conflagration reddened the night. The heat of a tropical country makes everything so dry that his plan would be certain to succeed. To burn the crops of an Arab is to this day the deadliest of all injuries (Burckhardt). This was the method adopted by Absalom, in <a href="/2_samuel/14-30.htm" title="Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.">2Samuel 14:30</a>, to gain an interview with Joab. It is needless to point out that the adoption of these rough, coarse, and cruel expedients must be as little judged by a later and better standard as his thirst for the revenge of personal wrongs. There can be no ground to question the literal truth of the narrative. It is in entire accordance with the custom of the East, and it finds curious confirmation from the story in Ovid's <span class= "ital">Fasti, </span>that every year, at the Cerealia, torches were tied to the tails of foxes, and they were let loose in the Roman circus, to commemorate the incident that on one occasion a young man at Carseoli, to punish a fox for depredations on his hen-coops, had wrapped it up in straw, and set it on fire, and that the creature had escaped into the corn-fields and burnt down the standing crops (Ovid, <span class= "ital">Fasti, </span>iv. 681-711). The attempt of Bochart to establish any connection between this custom and the revenge of Samson is quite untenable, but the incident itself throws light on the possibility of the narrative. Ewald refers to <span class= "ital">Meghad-ta, </span>liv. 4; Babrius, <span class= "ital">Fab., </span>11<p><span class= "bld">Both the shocks, and also the standing corn.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">from the heap, even up to the standing. </span>The extent of the vengeance and its terrible future consequences would be fully, and we fear ruthlessly, estimated by Samson, as he saw the rivers of fire running and spreading through that vast plain of corn-land in harvest-time.
