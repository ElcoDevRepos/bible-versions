Riddles were often used to test wisdom and understanding, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Solomon's interactions with the Queen of Sheba. Samson's riddle is a pivotal moment in his narrative, showcasing his cleverness but also foreshadowing the conflict that arises from his interactions with the Philistines.<p><b>&#8220;If you can solve it for me within the seven days of the feast,</b><br>The seven-day feast is indicative of a traditional wedding celebration in ancient Israelite culture, which often lasted a week. This period is significant as it aligns with the time of celebration and covenant-making, yet it becomes a time of tension and betrayal for Samson. The number seven is also symbolic in the Bible, often representing completeness or perfection, which contrasts with the imperfect and tumultuous events that unfold.<p><b>I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.</b><br>The wager of thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes highlights the wealth and status involved in such a bet. Linen garments were considered valuable and were often associated with nobility and priestly attire, as seen in <a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>. The mention of clothing also has deeper biblical symbolism, often representing righteousness or identity. In this context, the garments symbolize the stakes of the riddle and the ensuing conflict, as well as the cultural importance of honor and reputation in ancient societies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

Jewish legends have much to tell us of the riddles which passed between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and between Solomon and Hiram (Dius <span class= "ital">ap. </span>Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt. </span>viii. 5, ? 3); and as large sums often depended on the discovery of the answer, they were very much of the nature of wagers. A sharp boy named Abdemon helped Hiram, just as the Greek sage Bias is said to have helped Amasis to solve the riddles of the Ethiopian king, which would otherwise have caused heavy losses. The Sphinx of Theban legend devoured those who could not solve her riddle. Mirth and riddles are also connected with the rites of Hercules (Mller, <span class= "ital">Dorians, </span>ii. 12).<p><span class= "bld">Sheets.</span>--Rather, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">shirts; </span>but it means shirts of fine linen (<span class= "ital">sedinim; </span>LXX.
