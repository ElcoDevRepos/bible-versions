The Philistines were a seafaring people who settled in the coastal regions of Canaan. Samson, a judge of Israel, had been a significant threat to them. His capture was a moment of triumph for the Philistines, as he had previously caused them much trouble. The public display of Samson was likely in a temple or public square, emphasizing their victory over him.<p><b>they praised their god</b><br>The Philistines worshiped Dagon, a deity often associated with grain and fertility. Praising their god in this context was a common practice in the ancient Near East, where military victories were attributed to divine favor. This act of worship highlights the polytheistic nature of the Philistines and contrasts with the monotheistic worship of Yahweh by the Israelites.<p><b>saying: &#8220;Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy</b><br>The Philistines believed that Dagon had granted them victory over Samson, whom they considered their enemy. This reflects the ancient belief that gods were directly involved in the affairs of nations and battles. The phrase underscores the Philistines' reliance on their deity for success and their interpretation of events as divine intervention.<p><b>who destroyed our land</b><br>Samson had previously wreaked havoc on the Philistines, including burning their fields and defeating their armies. This phrase acknowledges the significant damage he caused to their territory and resources. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines during the period of the judges.<p><b>and multiplied our dead.&#8221;</b><br>Samson's actions had resulted in the deaths of many Philistines, including the famous incident where he killed a thousand men with the jawbone of a donkey. This phrase highlights the extent of the loss suffered by the Philistines due to Samson's strength and actions. It also foreshadows the final act of Samson's life, where he would bring down the temple of Dagon, killing many more Philistines in his death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was derived from his Nazirite vow to God.

The crowd&#8217;s sight of him is more than a glance&#8212;it signals his apparent defeat and their triumph. Scripture often records pagan nations showcasing captured leaders to announce victory (cf. <a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/luke/23-35.htm">Luke 23:35</a>). In this humiliating display, the Philistines believe they have overcome both Samson and Israel&#8217;s God, yet Judges has already shown that God can use even a judge&#8217;s weakness for His purposes (<a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they praised their god</b><p>Their temple to Dagon erupts in worship (<a href="/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23</a>). Instead of acknowledging the LORD, they attribute success to an idol of wood and stone (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4&#8211;8</a>). Moments like this echo the later scene when the Ark is placed before Dagon and the idol falls twice (<a href="/1_samuel/5-2.htm">1 Samuel 5:2&#8211;5</a>), underscoring the futility of false gods. The Philistines&#8217; praise is misplaced, but it sets up a dramatic demonstration of the living God&#8217;s supremacy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying: &#8220;Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy</b><p>They credit Dagon for Samson&#8217;s capture, ignoring that the LORD had sovereignly withdrawn Samson&#8217;s strength after Delilah&#8217;s betrayal (<a href="/judges/16-19.htm">Judges 16:19&#8211;20</a>). Like Pharaoh who misread Israel&#8217;s situation at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-3.htm">Exodus 14:3</a>), the Philistines misinterpret God&#8217;s patience as impotence. Their confidence will be short-lived, for God is orchestrating a final act of judgment through Samson&#8217;s weakness (<a href="/judges/16-28.htm">Judges 16:28&#8211;30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who destroyed our land</b><p>This line recalls Samson&#8217;s earlier exploits: burning the grain fields with foxes (<a href="/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4&#8211;5</a>) and attacking those who oppressed Israel (<a href="/judges/15-8.htm">Judges 15:8</a>). From the Philistine perspective, Samson &#8220;destroyed&#8221; their prosperity; from God&#8217;s perspective, Samson was an instrument of deliverance for His people (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). Their accusation reveals how deeply they felt his impact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and multiplied our dead.&#8221;</b><p>Samson&#8217;s single-handed victories had piled up Philistine casualties&#8212;1,000 men with a donkey&#8217;s jawbone alone (<a href="/judges/15-15.htm">Judges 15:15</a>). The phrase &#8220;multiplied our dead&#8221; shows the scale of loss they had suffered. Ironically, their boasting foreshadows the even greater loss about to occur when Samson brings the temple down, killing &#8220;more at his death than he had killed in his life&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-30.htm">Judges 16:30</a>). Their pride becomes the prelude to their downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/16-24.htm">Judges 16:24</a> captures a moment of pagan celebration over God&#8217;s servant, yet every phrase exposes both the emptiness of idolatry and the hidden hand of the LORD. The Philistines&#8217; triumph is temporary; their god Dagon receives praise he cannot deserve or sustain. God&#8217;s sovereignty overrules human pride, and Samson&#8217;s apparent defeat becomes the stage for a final, decisive act of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the people</span>, etc. The <span class="accented">.people</span>, as distinguished from the lords in the preceding verse, to show how universally the capture of Samson was ascribed to Dagon. Rulers and people alike praised Dagon. <span class="cmt_word">Saw</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span>. Not on the occasion of his being brought into the temple as mentioned in ver. 25, but after his capture, and whenever they saw him grinding or elsewhere. It was this universal ascription of praise to Dagon that led to the celebration of this great feast. This praise of Dagon is also dwelt upon to show that God, in what happened, vindicated the glory of his own great name, which was blasphemed by the servants of Dagon when they thus made him superior to Jehovah. So Milton makes Samson say, "All the contest is now 'Twixt God and Dagon .... He, be sure, will not connive or linger, thus provoked, but will arise, and his great name assert." Generally, the 'Samson Agonistes' is an excellent commentary on the history of Samson. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/16-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
