The phrase "on that day" often marks a significant moment in biblical narratives, emphasizing the immediacy and urgency of the situation.<p><b>the Benjamites mobilized</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's youngest son, Benjamin. Mobilization here refers to the preparation for battle, highlighting the tribal unity and readiness to defend their own, despite the moral implications of the conflict. This reflects the tribal loyalty and the decentralized nature of Israelite society during the time of the Judges.<p><b>26,000 swordsmen from their cities</b><br>The number 26,000 indicates a substantial military force, suggesting the size and strength of the tribe of Benjamin. The mention of "swordsmen" underscores the preparedness for armed conflict. The cities refer to the various settlements within the territory allotted to Benjamin, which included strategic locations such as Jerusalem and Jericho.<p><b>in addition to the 700 select men of Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah was a significant city within the territory of Benjamin, known for the grievous sin that led to the conflict described in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-21</a>. The "700 select men" implies a group of elite warriors, possibly chosen for their skill and valor. This detail highlights the seriousness with which the Benjamites approached the impending battle.

Earlier, <a href="/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a> pictured Benjamin as a &#8220;ravenous wolf,&#8221; a prophetic glimpse of courage mixed with ferocity. Here that nature surfaces.

The verse confirms Scripture&#8217;s historical precision, showcases tribal solidarity, and warns that skill and strength divorced from obedience lead to tragedy. God&#8217;s Word invites us to align our unity, numbers, and talents with His righteous standard, not merely with tribal loyalty or human pride.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Out of the cities.</span>--They could only live in cities, because the Jebusites still held Jerusalem, and the Canaanites around them were very incompletely subdued.<p><span class= "bld">Twenty and six thousand.</span>--This seems to be the correct number, and is found in the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic. Josephus, however (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 2, ? 10), has 25,000, as also has Codex A of theLXX., and Codex B has 23,000 (see Note on <a href="/judges/20-46.htm" title="So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.">Judges 20:46</a>). We see generally that the Benjamites, like the rest of the Israelites, in spite of their exceptional increase in the wilderness, had been now diminished by about a third since the last census (<a href="/numbers/26-41.htm" title="These are the sons of Benjamin after their families: and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and six hundred.">Numbers 26:41</a>). (See Note on <a href="/judges/20-2.htm" title="And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.">Judges 20:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Seven hundred chosen men.</span>--There seems to be some uncertainty or confusion in the text here. It is difficult to imagine that, as the text stands, the single city of Gibeah furnished to the Benjamites their one choice contingent of seven hundred slingers, and it would be a curious coincidence that the force of Gibeah and the slingers should each be exactly seven hundred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty and six thousand</span>. The numbers of Benjamin in the wilderness were at the first numbering 35,400, and at the second 45,600 (<a href="/numbers/1-36.htm">Numbers 1:36</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-23.htm">Numbers 2:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-41.htm">Numbers 26:41</a>). It is impossible to account with certainty for the falling off in the numbers by so many as near 20,000; but perhaps many were slain in the wars of Canaan, and the unsettled times were unfavourable to early marriages. For the whole of Israel there was, as appeared by ver. 2, note, a falling off of nearly 200,000 men, or, to speak exactly (601,730-400,000 +26,700), of 175,030. <span class="cmt_word">Which were numbered</span>. There is some obscurity in this latter clause; but, in spite of the accents being opposed to it, the A.V. seems certainly right. The rendering acording to the accents, "they (the Benjamites) were numbered, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, seven hundred chosen men," makes no sense, and does not explain who the 700 were. The population of Gibeah would be about 5 &times; 700, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 3500, according to this statement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
