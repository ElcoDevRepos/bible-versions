In the context of Judges, this empowerment is often seen in the judges who deliver Israel from oppression. The Spirit's stirring indicates the beginning of Samson's divine mission. This is similar to other instances in the Old Testament where the Spirit empowers individuals, such as Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The stirring suggests an internal prompting or awakening to action, signifying God's direct involvement in Samson's life and mission.<p><b>at Mahaneh-dan</b><br>Mahaneh-dan, meaning "camp of Dan," is a location associated with the tribe of Dan. This site is significant as it marks the place where the tribe of Dan settled during their migration (<a href="/judges/18-12.htm">Judges 18:12</a>). The mention of Mahaneh-dan highlights the tribal context of Samson's story, as he was from the tribe of Dan. This location serves as a geographical marker for the beginning of Samson's activities and is a reminder of the tribal divisions and settlements in Israel during the period of the judges.<p><b>between Zorah and Eshtaol</b><br>Zorah and Eshtaol are towns in the territory of Dan, near the border with Judah. These locations are significant in Samson's narrative, as they are part of his homeland. Zorah is noted as Samson's birthplace (<a href="/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2</a>), and Eshtaol is frequently mentioned in connection with his early life and burial (<a href="/judges/16-31.htm">Judges 16:31</a>). The mention of these towns situates the narrative in a specific geographical context, emphasizing the local origins of Samson's mission. This area is also archaeologically significant, with evidence of ancient settlements that provide insight into the period's cultural and historical background.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_the_lord.htm">The Spirit of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the divine presence and power of God, which begins to move in Samson, indicating the start of his divine mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, chosen by God to begin the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines.

Samson stands in that same line of Spirit-empowered deliverers.<p>&#8226; Before Pentecost the Holy Spirit selectively empowered individuals for specific tasks (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). His coming on Samson shows divine initiative&#8212;Israel&#8217;s rescue will be God&#8217;s work, not human ingenuity (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today the passage foreshadows the permanent indwelling promised in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>began to stir him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Stir&#8221; pictures an inner prompting, an irresistible urge to act.

God meets Samson where his tribe is encamped, underscoring:<p>&#8211; Ministry begins in one&#8217;s own community (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> starts with Jerusalem).<p>&#8211; Even a spiritually struggling tribe (<a href="/bsb/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a> shows Dan&#8217;s idolatry) can become the setting for God&#8217;s work.<p>&#8226; The camp context hints at warfare; the Judge will function as Israel&#8217;s champion (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>between Zorah and Eshtaol</b><p>&#8226; These neighboring towns lay on Judah&#8217;s border (<a href="/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33</a>). Samson grows up in a borderland&#8212;fitting for someone called to confront the Philistines who occupied nearby territory (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God often raises deliverers from seemingly insignificant places: Bethlehem for David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-15.htm">1 Samuel 17:15</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase roots the event in real geography, reminding us that biblical history unfolds in verifiable locations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a> records the first movement of the Holy Spirit in Samson&#8217;s life. The verse teaches that God Himself initiates deliverance, gradually prepares His chosen servant, and does so within ordinary settings and flawed communities. Samson&#8217;s upcoming feats are therefore to be read not as mere tales of human strength but as demonstrations of God&#8217;s power working through a stirred, Spirit-empowered life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">The Spirit of the Lord.</span>--<a href="/judges/3-10.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.">Judges 3:10</a>.
