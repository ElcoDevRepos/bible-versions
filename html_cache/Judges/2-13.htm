Historically, this period follows the death of Joshua, when the Israelites were settling into the Promised Land. The forsaking of God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often leading to dire consequences. This act of forsaking is a violation of the covenant established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24), where the Israelites pledged exclusive loyalty to Yahweh. The forsaking of God is also a precursor to the cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance that characterize the Book of Judges.<p><b>and served Baal</b><br>Baal was a prominent Canaanite deity associated with fertility, storms, and agriculture. The worship of Baal was widespread among the Canaanites, and it often involved rituals that were abhorrent to the Israelites, such as child sacrifice and temple prostitution. The Israelites' service to Baal represents a significant spiritual decline, as they adopted the religious practices of the surrounding nations, contrary to God's command to remain separate and holy (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). This service to Baal is a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and illustrates the seductive power of idolatry.<p><b>and the Ashtoreths</b><br>Ashtoreth, also known as Astarte or Ishtar, was a goddess of love and war, often associated with Baal. The plural form "Ashtoreths" suggests the worship of multiple manifestations or local versions of this goddess. The worship of Ashtoreth typically involved immoral practices, which were in stark contrast to the moral and ethical standards set by God for His people. The Israelites' worship of the Ashtoreths further demonstrates their assimilation into Canaanite culture and religion, leading them away from the worship of the one true God. This idolatry is condemned throughout the Old Testament and is seen as spiritual adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were led out of Egypt and into the Promised Land.

The plural form may be, as Ewald thinks, the plural of excellence, or like Baalim an allusion to the different forms and attributes under which the goddess was worshipped. The worship of Baalim and Ashtaroth naturally went hand in hand. (See <a href="/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-4.htm" title="Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.">1Samuel 7:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-10.htm" title="And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.">1Samuel 12:10</a>.) Ashtaroth is not to be confused with the Asheroth (rendered "groves" in the E. V.) mentioned in <a href="/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>. The words resemble each other less in Hebrew, as Ashtaroth begins with <span class= "greekheb"></span>, not with <span class= "greekheb"></span>.

The many images of Baal and Ashtoreth are, in the opinion of some, indicated by the plural; but others think that different modifications or impersonations of the god and goddess are indicated. Thus we read of <span class="accented">Baal-berith</span>, the god who presides over covenants; <span class="accented">Baal-zebul</span>, or <span class="accented">Zebub</span>, the god who presides over flies, who could either send or remove a plague of flies, and so on. "Baal (lord or master) was the supreme male divinity of the Phoenician and Canaanitish nations, as Ashtoreth (perhaps <span class="accented">the star</span>, the planet Venus) was their supreme female divinity.
