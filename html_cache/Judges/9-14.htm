The trees represent the people of Israel, and the thornbush symbolizes Abimelech. The use of a thornbush is significant; it is a lowly and undesirable plant, often associated with desolation and curse (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). This choice highlights the folly of choosing an unworthy leader. The parable serves as a critique of Abimelech's kingship, as he was not a legitimate ruler but seized power through violence and manipulation. The thornbush's role contrasts with the noble trees, such as the olive, fig, and vine, which previously declined the offer to reign, symbolizing leaders who prioritize service over power.<p><b>&#8216;Come and reign over us.&#8217;</b><br>This invitation reflects the people's willingness to accept a ruler who is not ideal, driven by desperation or lack of discernment. It echoes the Israelites' later demand for a king in <a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>, where they seek to be like other nations, despite God's warnings. The phrase underscores the theme of human tendency to choose leaders based on immediate needs or desires rather than divine guidance. It also foreshadows the consequences of such choices, as seen in Abimelech's destructive reign. This part of the parable serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of godly leadership and the dangers of aligning with those who do not honor God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The youngest son of Gideon, who survived the massacre of his brothers by Abimelech.
