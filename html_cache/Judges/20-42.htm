The wilderness often symbolizes a place of desolation and testing in the Bible, as seen in the Israelites' 40 years of wandering (<a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16:1-3</a>). The Benjamites' flight toward the wilderness signifies their desperation and the dire situation they faced. This retreat can be compared to other biblical instances where enemies of Israel fled, such as the Canaanites in <a href="/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16</a>. The wilderness here may refer to the rugged terrain east of Gibeah, which provided limited refuge.<p><b>but the battle overtook them</b><br>The phrase indicates that the Benjamites could not escape the pursuing Israelite forces. This reflects the completeness of God's judgment against Benjamin for their sin, as the battle was divinely ordained (<a href="/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18, 28</a>). The inevitability of the battle overtaking them can be seen as a parallel to the inescapable nature of divine justice, reminiscent of the fate of the Egyptians at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23-28</a>). The relentless pursuit by the Israelites underscores the seriousness of the conflict and the determination to eradicate the sin from among them.<p><b>and the men coming out of the cities struck them down there</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the strategic ambush set by the Israelites. The men coming out of the cities were likely part of a tactical maneuver, similar to the ambush at Ai in <a href="/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3-8</a>. This strategy reflects the wisdom and planning involved in the battle, as well as the unity of the Israelite tribes in executing God's judgment. The cities mentioned could be those near Gibeah, where the Benjamites had initially sought refuge. The striking down of the Benjamites signifies the fulfillment of divine retribution and the restoration of justice, echoing the theme of God's sovereignty in battle as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who were engaged in a civil war against the tribe of Benjamin due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The area to which the Benjamites retreated, symbolizing a place of desolation and defeat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The conflict between the Israelites and the Benjamites, which was a result of the moral and social decay within the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities.htm">Cities</a></b><br>Refers to the cities of Israel from which men came out to join the battle against Benjamin, indicating a united front against sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, who were being punished for their refusal to hand over the perpetrators of a heinous crime in Gibeah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, when left unaddressed, leads to destruction and defeat.

It is described in Joshua 16 as "the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout Mount Bethel." (See Robinson, <span class= "ital">Bibl. Res. </span>1:572.) The first thought of fugitives in Eastern Palestine was to get to one of the fords of the Jordan (<a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm" title="And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.">2Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/25-4.htm" title="And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.">2Kings 25:4-5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</span>--This obscure clause is rendered differently in different versions. If the English Version be correct, as it probably is, the meaning must be that the Benjamites fled to their own cities, and were pursued thither and slain by the Israelites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they turned their backs</span>, etc. The narrative now at length advances one step. The result of the Benjamites finding themselves between the ambushment and the army of Israel was that they took to flight in an easterly direction (ver. 43) toward the wilderness, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wilderness described in <a href="/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a> as "the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout Mount Bethel," where the direction of the wilderness relative to Ephraim is also described as being "on the east." In like manner Zedekiah fled towards the plain (<span class="accented">arabah</span>) or plains of Jericho - a term nearly synonymous with <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (<a href="/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Them which came out of the cities</span>, etc. This is a very obscure passage, and is very variously explained. <span class="accented">Those which came out</span> of <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">cities</span> must be the same as are so described in ver. 15, and designates the Benjamites who were not inhabitants of Gibeah. The simplest way, therefore, to understand the passage is to render it without reference to the accents: "And the battle overtook him and those that were from the cities (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of Gibeah and the rest of the Benjamites), destroying him (the whole Benjamite army) in the midst of him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> going right into the midst of them, and destroying right and left. Some, however, render it <span class="accented">in the midst of it</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the wilderness.
