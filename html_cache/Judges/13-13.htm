This divine messenger frequently appears in pivotal moments, such as with Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). Manoah, the father of Samson, is seeking guidance, showing the importance of divine instruction in Israel's history. The angel's response emphasizes the direct communication between God and His people, highlighting the seriousness of the message being delivered.<p><b>&#8220;Your wife is to do everything I told her.&#8221;</b><br>This instruction underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. The angel had previously given specific instructions to Manoah's wife regarding her conduct during pregnancy (<a href="/judges/13-4.htm">Judges 13:4-5</a>), which included abstaining from wine, strong drink, and unclean food. These commands were part of the Nazirite vow, a special dedication to God (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>). The emphasis on the wife's obedience reflects the broader biblical theme of faithfulness to God's word, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience. This also foreshadows the role of Mary, the mother of Jesus, who similarly received divine instructions and responded with obedience (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>The father of Samson, Manoah is a Danite who seeks guidance from God regarding the upbringing of his promised son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who appears to Manoah's wife, announcing the birth of Samson and providing specific instructions for his upbringing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah's_wife.htm">Manoah's Wife</a></b><br>Though unnamed in the text, she is the mother of Samson and receives the initial revelation from the Angel of the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zorah.htm">Zorah</a></b><br>The town in the territory of Dan where Manoah and his family live.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>The future judge of Israel, whose life and mission are foretold by the Angel of the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_instructions.htm">Divine Instructions</a></b><br>God's guidance often comes with specific instructions that require obedience and faithfulness.

The response shows God&#8217;s eagerness to give clear guidance to parents who seek Him (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;angel of the LORD&#8221; is presented in Scripture as the LORD Himself appearing in human form (<a href="/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17-22</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11-18</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>). Manoah&#8217;s respectful fear (v. 22) underscores that this messenger carries divine authority.<p>&#8226; By answering Manoah directly, God affirms the husband&#8217;s leadership while also validating the earlier instructions given solely to his wife (<a href="/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3-7</a>). The incident mirrors how God spoke to both parents of John the Baptist separately and together (<a href="/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11-20, 26</a>-38, 57-63).<p>&#8226; Key takeaways:<p>&#8211; God hears earnest, humble requests for wisdom.<p>&#8211; Divine revelation is consistent; God does not contradict earlier instructions (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8211; When God repeats Himself, it signals the importance of listening carefully (<a href="/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Your wife is to do everything I told her.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The directive is absolute: &#8220;everything.&#8221; Partial obedience would undermine the consecration of the child (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, the angel had laid out specific Nazirite conditions for Samson&#8217;s mother&#8212;no wine or strong drink, no unclean food&#8212;because the boy was to be &#8220;a Nazirite to God from the womb&#8221; (<a href="/judges/13-4.htm">Judges 13:4-5</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-1.htm">Numbers 6:1-8</a>). The mother&#8217;s conduct directly affected the child&#8217;s calling, highlighting parental responsibility (<a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By reiterating the command, the angel emphasizes continuity: what God says once remains binding. Compare <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a> (&#8220;do according to all the law&#8221;), and <a href="/john/2-5.htm">John 2:5</a> (&#8220;Do whatever He tells you&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Practical implications:<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s instructions are not suggestions; they are life-shaping mandates (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-16</a>).<p>&#8211; Obedience in the hidden, everyday choices of a parent can shape a child&#8217;s destiny (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Holiness begins in the home; parents model consecration before their children ever do (<a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/13-13.htm">Judges 13:13</a> highlights God&#8217;s faithful guidance to those who ask and His expectation of complete obedience to His revealed word.
