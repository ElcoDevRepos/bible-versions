The context is Gideon's need for confirmation of God's promise to save Israel through him. This reflects God's patience and understanding of human doubt. It also shows God's sovereignty and control over nature, as He can manipulate natural elements to fulfill His purposes. This event occurs during the time of the Judges, a period characterized by Israel's cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance.<p><b>Only the fleece was dry,</b><br>The dry fleece amidst dew-covered ground is a miraculous sign, emphasizing God's power to alter natural conditions. The fleece, made from wool, would naturally absorb moisture, making its dryness even more remarkable. This sign is the second of two that Gideon requests, the first being the reverse condition. The fleece can be seen as a type of Christ, who remained pure and untouched by sin in a world marred by it. The fleece's dryness amidst dew symbolizes Christ's holiness and separation from sin.<p><b>and dew covered the ground.</b><br>Dew is a common biblical symbol of blessing and divine favor, often associated with God's provision and presence (e.g., <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>). In the ancient Near East, dew was crucial for agriculture, especially in arid regions. The widespread dew signifies God's abundant provision and faithfulness to His promises. This imagery connects to other scriptural instances where God uses natural phenomena to communicate with His people, such as the pillar of cloud and fire in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). The contrast between the dry fleece and the dew-laden ground underscores the miraculous nature of the sign and God's ability to work beyond natural laws.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Besides the simple narrative, which tells us of these results as a sign granted to Gideon in accordance with his prayer, it is of course possible to allegorise the dew as the sign of God's grace, and to say that the first sign represented Israel as replenished with God's love when all was dry around (<a href="/hosea/14-5.htm" title="I will be as the dew to Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.">Hosea 14:5</a>, "I will be as the dew unto Israel;" <a href="/micah/5-7.htm" title="And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the middle of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers on the grass, that tarries not for man, nor waits for the sons of men.">Micah 5:7</a>, "Jacob shall be as the dew"); and the second, the fact that "God manifested himself in the weakness and forsaken condition of His people, while the nations were flourishing all around." Similarly St. Ambrose (<span class= "ital">De Sp. Sanct, </span>Prol. in 1) sees in the fleece full of dew the Hebrew nation hiding the mystery of Christ within itself, and in the dry fleece that mystery extended to all the world, but leaving the Hebrew nation dry. It would be equally possible to give a mystic significance to the threshing-floor, as a type of the universal Church (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>, &c.). But these allegoric applications of simple narratives are, to say the least, precarious; nor is there much value in Ewald's comparison of the fleece to Gideon's character, cool amid the general passion, dry amid the general damp of fear.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/6-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
