Joshua's leadership is marked by faithfulness and obedience to God, qualities that are essential for spiritual leadership.<p><b>the servant of the LORD</b><br>This title highlights Joshua's role and character. Being called a "servant of the LORD" is a high honor, indicating his dedication and submission to God's will. This title is also used for Moses, showing a continuity of leadership and divine mission. It underscores the biblical principle that true leadership is rooted in servanthood, a theme echoed in the New Testament by Jesus Christ, who came not to be served but to serve.<p><b>died at the age of 110</b><br>Joshua's age at death, 110, is significant in the biblical context. It reflects a full and blessed life, as 110 was considered an ideal lifespan in ancient Near Eastern cultures. His death marks the end of an era for Israel, transitioning from the conquest of Canaan to the period of the Judges. This age also connects Joshua to the patriarchs, like Joseph, who also died at 110, symbolizing a life of divine favor and fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Joshua was the son of Nun and the successor of Moses.
