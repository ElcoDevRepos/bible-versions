The two-month period reflects a time of preparation and reflection, which is significant in biblical narratives. It parallels other instances in Scripture where time is set aside for mourning or preparation, such as the 40 days Moses spent on Mount Sinai.<p><b>she returned to her father</b><br>The return signifies obedience and submission to her father's vow, highlighting the cultural and familial expectations of the time. In ancient Israel, family honor and fulfilling vows were paramount, and her return underscores her acceptance of her fate. This act of returning also reflects the broader biblical theme of returning to one's roots or destiny, seen in stories like the Prodigal Son.<p><b>and he did to her as he had vowed</b><br>Jephthah's vow, made in <a href="/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30-31</a>, was to offer whatever came out of his house as a burnt offering to the Lord. This phrase has been the subject of much debate, with interpretations ranging from literal sacrifice to lifelong dedication to temple service. The gravity of fulfilling vows is emphasized throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against making rash vows.<p><b>And she had never had relations with a man</b><br>This detail emphasizes her virginity, which in the cultural context of ancient Israel, was significant for a woman's identity and future. Virginity was often associated with purity and dedication to God, as seen in the Nazarite vow (Numbers 6). This aspect of her life also connects to the theme of sacrifice and dedication, paralleling the purity of offerings required by the Law.<p><b>So it has become a custom in Israel</b><br>The establishment of a custom indicates the lasting impact of this event on the community. It suggests a ritual or tradition that arose from this narrative, possibly involving the commemoration of Jephthah's daughter. This reflects the broader biblical theme of memorials and traditions that serve as reminders of significant events, similar to the Passover or the stones set up by Joshua in the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his rash vow to God, which led to a tragic fulfillment involving his daughter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah's_daughter.htm">Jephthah's Daughter</a></b><br>The unnamed daughter of Jephthah, who becomes the subject of her father's vow and its fulfillment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>The place where Jephthah lived and where he made his vow to the Lord.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vow.htm">The Vow</a></b><br>Jephthah's promise to offer as a burnt offering whatever came out of his house to greet him if he returned victorious from battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation that Jephthah was leading and delivering from the oppression of the Ammonites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_words.htm">The Weight of Words</a></b><br>Jephthah's account teaches us the importance of considering our words carefully, especially when making promises to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rash_decisions.htm">The Consequences of Rash Decisions</a></b><br>This passage highlights the potential consequences of making hasty decisions without seeking God's guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>Despite the tragic outcome, Jephthah's inclusion in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a> reminds us that God can use imperfect people for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_practices_and_god's_will.htm">Cultural Practices and God's Will</a></b><br>The establishment of a custom in Israel from this event shows how cultural practices can emerge from significant events, but they must always be weighed against God's will and commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_women_in_scripture.htm">The Role of Women in Scripture</a></b><br>Jephthah's daughter, though unnamed, plays a significant role in this account, reminding us of the often-overlooked contributions of women in biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_11_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 11:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_11_39_Vow_importance.htm">How does Judges 11:39 illustrate the importance of keeping vows to God?

Those sixty days were not a stall tactic; they were a season of honest lament, like the thirty days Israel mourned for Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>, or the time allowed for rites of grief in <a href="/numbers/20-29.htm">Numbers 20:29</a>. Her return shows she accepted the cost of her father&#8217;s vow rather than fleeing from it&#8212;an obedience reminiscent of Isaac walking back down Moriah with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-7.htm">Genesis 22:7-8</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she returned to her father</b><p>&#8226;&#8195;The phrase underscores voluntary submission.

How was it carried out? Two biblical facts stand side by side:<p>1. God expressly forbids human sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>).<p>2. Burnt offerings were to be wholly consumed (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).<p>Because God&#8217;s law cannot contradict itself, many understand Jephthah to have kept the vow by dedicating his daughter to lifelong service at the tabernacle, not by taking her life. <a href="/leviticus/27-2.htm">Leviticus 27:2-4</a> shows persons could be &#8220;devoted to the LORD&#8221; and redeemed; yet a rash vow could also remain unredeemed (<a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>, &#8220;who keeps his oath even when it hurts&#8221;). Her perpetual virginity&#8212;an irreversible sacrifice of future family and inheritance&#8212;would satisfy the letter of her father&#8217;s words without transgressing God&#8217;s prohibition of murder.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And she had never had relations with a man</b><p>The text repeats her virginity to stress what was lost:<p>&#8226;&#8195;In Israel, bearing children was tied to covenant hope (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-14.htm">Ruth 4:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Perpetual celibacy meant forfeiting that blessing, a living sacrifice comparable to the Nazirites who were &#8220;holy to the LORD&#8221; for life (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting are noted in <a href="/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>; Jephthah&#8217;s daughter likely joined their ranks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So it has become a custom in Israel</b><p><a href="/judges/11-40.htm">Judges 11:40</a> adds, &#8220;Every year the young women of Israel go to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah&#8230;four days each year.&#8221; Her story became an annual reminder that:<p>&#8226;&#8195;God takes our words seriously (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Rash vows can wound innocents (<a href="/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;Even in flawed situations, faithfulness and purity still shine (<a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32-34</a> includes Jephthah among the faithful).<p>The custom functioned like the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26-27</a>) or the Lord&#8217;s Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24-26</a>): a repeated act that keeps a lesson alive across generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/11-39.htm">Judges 11:39</a> records the sober fulfillment of a reckless promise. After two months of mourning, Jephthah&#8217;s daughter willingly returned, and her father honored his vow by setting her apart to lifelong virgin service&#8212;an outcome faithful to his words yet not in conflict with God&#8217;s law against human sacrifice. Her loss became Israel&#8217;s yearly lesson on the gravity of vows, the cost of obedience, and the enduring call to honor the LORD with wholehearted devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">Who did with her according to his vow.</span>--In this significant euphemism the narrator drops the veil--as though with a shudder--over the terrible sacrifice. Of course, "did with her according to his vow" can only mean <span class= "ital">"</span>offered her up for a burnt offering" (<a href="/judges/11-31.htm" title="Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.">Judges 11:31</a>). "Some," says Luther, "affirm that he did not sacrifice her; but the text is clear enough." The attempt, first started by Rabbi Kimchi, to make this mean "kept her unmarried until death"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>shut her up in a sacred celibacy--is a mere sophistication of plain Scripture. That he did actually slay her in accordance with his <span class= "ital">cherem </span>is clear, not only from the plain words, but also for the following reasons:--(1) The customs of that day knew nothing about treating women as <span class= "ital">"</span>nuns." If there had been any institution of vestals among the Jews we should without fail have heard of it, nor would the fate of Jephthah's daughter been here regarded and represented as exceptionally tragic. (2) There are decisive Scriptural analogies to Jephthah's vow, taken in its most literal sense--Abraham (<a href="/genesis/23-3.htm" title="And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,">Genesis 23:3</a>), Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-44.htm" title="And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan.">1Samuel 14:44</a>), &c. (See on <a href="/judges/11-31.htm" title="Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.">Judges 11:31</a>.) (3) There are decisive Pagan analogies, both Oriental (<a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm" title="Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.">2Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="/amos/2-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:">Amos 2:1</a>) and classical. Thus Idomeneus actually sacrificed his eldest son (Serv. <span class= "ital">ad 'n. </span>iii. 331) in an exactly similar vow, and Agamemnon his daughter Iphigenia. (4) The ancient Jews, who were far better acquainted than we can be with the thoughts and customs of their race and the meaning of their own language, have always understood that Jephthah did literally offer his daughter as "a burnt offering." The Targum of Jonathan adds to the words "it was a custom in Israel" the explanation, "in order that no one should make his son or his daughter a burnt offering, as Jephthah did, and did not consult Phinehas the priest. Had he done so, he would have redeemed her with money"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Phinehas would have decided that it was <span class= "ital">less </span>crime to redeem such a <span class= "ital">cherem </span>than to offer a human sacrifice. It is curious to find that another legend (<span class= "ital">hagadah</span>) connects Phinehas with this event in a very different way. It says that Phinehas sanctioned, and even performed the sacrifice, and that for this very reason he was superseded by the indignation of the Israelites, which is the reason they offer for the fact that Eli was of the house, <span class= "ital">not </span>of Phmehas, but of Ithamar (Lightfoot, <span class= "ital">Works, </span>i. 12-18). In the same way Idomeneus, after sacrificing his eldest son, is punished by the gods with plague and by his citizens with banishment. Josephus agrees with these Jewish authorities, and says that Jephthah offered (<span class= "ital">holokautosen</span>) his daughter (see on <a href="/judges/11-31.htm" title="Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.">Judges 11:31</a>); and so does Rabbi Tanchum. The opinion was undisputed till a thousand years after Christ, when Rabbi Kimchi invented the plausible hypothesis which has pleased so many commentators who carry their own notions to the Bible ready made, and then find them there. Ewald contents himself with saying that this "timid modern notion needs no refutation." It is remarkable that we find a similar vow as late as the sixth century after Christ. Abd Almuttalib, grandfather of Mohammed, vows to kill his son Abd Allah if God will give him ten sons. He had twelve sons; but when he wishes to perform his vow the Koreish interfere, and Abd Almuttalib, at the bidding of a priestess, gives one hundred camels as a ransom (Weil, <span class= "ital">Mohammed, </span>p. 8). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who did with her according to his vow</span>. Nothing can be more express than this statement. In fact, except the natural horror we feel at a human sacrifice, there is nothing to cast the least shade of doubt upon the fact that Jephthah's daughter was offered up as a burnt offering, in accordance with heathen notions, but, as Josephus says, neither "conformably to the law, nor acceptably to God." Most of the early Jewish commentators and all the Christian Fathers for ten or eleven centuries (Origen, Chrysostom, Theo-doret, Jerome, Augustine, etc.) held this view. Luther's comment is, "Some affirm that he did not sacrifice her, but the text is clear enough." <span class="cmt_word">She knew</span>.
