The tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, was engaged in a civil war against the other Israelite tribes due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah (Judges 19). This moment of realization signifies the fulfillment of divine justice against the Benjamites for their actions. The defeat also highlights the consequences of sin and disobedience to God's laws, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The Benjamites' realization can be compared to moments of recognition of sin and its consequences in other biblical narratives, such as David's realization of his sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12).<p><b>Now the men of Israel had retreated before Benjamin</b><br>The strategic retreat by the men of Israel was a tactical maneuver rather than a sign of weakness. This retreat was part of a larger military strategy to draw the Benjamites away from their stronghold. The use of such tactics is reminiscent of other biblical battles where God provided wisdom and strategy to His people, such as the battle of Ai in <a href="/joshua/8.htm">Joshua 8</a>. The retreat also demonstrates the Israelites' reliance on divine guidance and their willingness to follow God's instructions, even when it involved unconventional methods.<p><b>because they were relying on the ambush they had set against Gibeah.</b><br>The ambush set against Gibeah was a critical component of the Israelites' battle plan. This tactic involved a hidden force waiting to attack the city once the main Benjamite forces were drawn out. The use of an ambush reflects the Israelites' understanding of warfare and their ability to execute complex strategies. It also underscores the theme of divine justice, as the ambush was part of God's plan to punish the Benjamites for their sin. The concept of an ambush can be seen in other biblical contexts, such as the ambush at Ai (Joshua 8), where God instructed Joshua to use a similar strategy. This reliance on divine strategy points to the importance of seeking God's guidance in overcoming challenges and achieving victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, known for their skilled warriors.

Earlier, they had twice routed Israel (<a href="/judges/20-21.htm">Judges 20:21, 25</a>), but the Lord had assured Israel of ultimate victory (<a href="/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>). Benjamin&#8217;s realization fulfills that divine word.<p>&#8226; The text shows a sudden awakening&#8212;similar to Pharaoh&#8217;s army recognizing God&#8217;s hand against them at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25</a>). When God decrees judgment, recognition can come abruptly and too late for repentance.<p>&#8226; Their defeat is not merely military; it is moral. Benjamin had chosen to shield the wickedness in Gibeah (<a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22&#8211;24</a>; 20:13). <a href="/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5&#8211;6</a> echoes this: &#8220;the wicked are ensnared by their own desires.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now the men of Israel had retreated before Benjamin</b><p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s withdrawal looks like panic, yet it is intentional. Earlier, God directed Israel to set an ambush (<a href="/judges/20-29.htm">Judges 20:29&#8211;30</a>). So the &#8220;retreat&#8221; is a feigned flight, much like Joshua&#8217;s tactic at Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-14.htm">Joshua 8:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The seeming setback tests Israel&#8217;s faith. They must trust God&#8217;s strategy rather than appearances (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Sometimes obedience involves stepping back so that God&#8217;s plan can unfold.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because they were relying on the ambush they had set against Gibeah</b><p>&#8226; The ambush fulfills the precise instructions given in verses 29&#8211;34. Israel divides its forces, placing 10,000 valiant men near Gibeah (<a href="/judges/20-34.htm">Judges 20:34</a>). This coordinated plan mirrors Gideon&#8217;s reliance on divine strategy over brute strength (<a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Relying on&#8221; signals faith in God-given means, not mere human cunning. <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16&#8211;18</a> reminds us that victory is not by &#8220;large army&#8221; but by the Lord&#8217;s eye upon those who fear Him.<p>&#8226; Gibeah&#8217;s destruction serves both justice and purification. <a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-15</a> prescribes rooting out covenant-breaking evil from within Israel, and the ambush answers that command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-36.htm">Judges 20:36</a> records the turning point of the civil war: Benjamin at last recognizes defeat, while Israel&#8217;s apparent retreat is actually trustful obedience to God&#8217;s ambush plan. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s justice prevails, even when His people must first appear weak, and that faith follows divine instruction rather than visible circumstances.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">That they were smitten.</span>--The "they" refers to the Israelites. The rest of the verse gives the reason for the feigned flight.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten</span>. Not of course after 25,000 of them had been smitten, but at that period of the battle more fully described in vers. 40, 41, when the Benjamites, looking behind them, saw Gibeah in flames, and immediately broke and fled towards the wilderness. In the latter half of this verse and in the following verses to ver. 41 the writer recapitulates all the preceding circumstances, some of which have been already mentioned, which led to the particular incident mentioned in the beginning of the verse, that "Benjamin saw that they were smitten;" viz., the feigned flight of the Israelites, the seizing and burning of Gibeah by the liers in wait, the signal of a great smoke, and the turning again of the flying Israelites. It was then that "the men of Benjamin saw that evil was come upon them," and turned their backs and fled. Thus vers. 36 (latter half)-41 bring us back through the details to the identical point already reached at the beginning of ver. 36. In vers. 39, 40 there is another retrograde movement in the narrative, in which the statement of vers. 31, 32 is repeated in order to bring into close juxtaposition Benjamin's keen pursuit of the enemy with his terror when he saw the smoke rising in his rear. <span class="cmt_word">Hasted</span> (ver. 37). This is an amplification with further particulars of ver. 33. The liers in wait not only came forth out of their place, but they made a dash to get into Gibeah before the men of Gibeah, who were pursuing the flying Israelites, could be aware of their intention. <span class="cmt_word">Rushed upon</span>. Perhaps better rendered <span class="accented">fell upon</span>. It is exactly the same phrase as 2 Samuel 27:8, there rather tamely rendered in<span class="accented">vaded</span> and in ver. 10 <span class="accented">made a road</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Drew themselves</span> <span class="cmt_word">along</span>. Some take the word in the common sense of <span class="accented">blowing the trumpet</span>, but it rather <span class="accented">means</span> spread <span class="accented">themselves out</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7a;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.) through the defenceless city, so as to slay and burn in all parts simultaneously. <span class="cmt_word">That they should make a great flame with smoke,</span> etc. (ver. 38). The Hebrew of this verse is difficult to construe, but the A.V. gives substantially the right sense. They seem to be the very orders given to the leader of the ambush. "Make them (the ambush) multiply to send up (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> send up in great quantities) the column of smoke from the city." It seems that the appearance of the smoke was the signal for the Israelites to turn (ver. 41). <span class="cmt_word">The flame</span>, etc. (ver. 40). Rather, <span class="accented">the column began to go up in</span> (or as) <span class="accented">a pillar of smoke. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The flame of the city</span>.
