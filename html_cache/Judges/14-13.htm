The context is a seven-day celebration, typical of ancient Near Eastern wedding customs. Samson's challenge involves a riddle, a common form of entertainment and intellectual exercise in ancient cultures. The inability to solve the riddle would result in a forfeit, highlighting the competitive nature of such feasts.<p><b>you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.&#8221;</b><br>The wager involves thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes, which were valuable items in ancient times. Linen was a luxury fabric, often associated with wealth and status. The number thirty may symbolize completeness or a significant group, as seen in other biblical contexts. This demand underscores the seriousness of the challenge and the potential for significant loss or gain.<p><b>&#8220;Tell us your riddle,&#8221; they replied.</b><br>The response of the Philistine companions shows their willingness to engage in the challenge. Riddles were a popular form of entertainment and intellectual challenge in the ancient world, often used to test wisdom and understanding. This interaction sets the stage for the unfolding drama, as the riddle becomes a pivotal element in the narrative.<p><b>&#8220;Let us hear it.&#8221;</b><br>Their eagerness to hear the riddle reflects the cultural value placed on wit and cleverness.

As Israel&#8217;s judge, he begins destabilizing Philistine confidence from within their own celebration (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>; 15:3-5).<p>&#8226; The number thirty anticipates Samson&#8217;s later slaughter of thirty men in Ashkelon to pay this very debt (<a href="/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>), illustrating how sin&#8217;s wager with the world turns violent and costly (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;&#8216;Tell us your riddle,&#8217; they replied.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The Philistines accept, confident in their collective wisdom. Their eagerness parallels other pagan courts trusting human cleverness&#8212;only to be outdone by God&#8217;s agent (<a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11-12</a>; <a href="/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9-13</a>).<p>&#8226; They presume that, if stumped, they can still resort to intimidation, which they eventually do by threatening Samson&#8217;s bride (<a href="/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene warns of pride that underestimates God&#8217;s servant and overestimates human resources (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;&#8216;Let us hear it.&#8217;&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The invitation moves the plot forward, but it also unearths a spiritual lesson: whenever God&#8217;s truth confronts the world, a hearing is granted&#8212;yet motives are mixed (<a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37-38</a>; <a href="/acts/17-19.htm">Acts 17:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s riddle (&#8220;Out of the eater came something to eat&#8230;,&#8221; <a href="/judges/14-14.htm">Judges 14:14</a>) draws from his private encounter with the lion and honey (<a href="/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5-9</a>). Only Samson and God know the answer, underscoring divine revelation versus human guesswork (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; By asking to hear, the Philistines enter a test that exposes hearts, much like Jesus&#8217; parables sifted listeners (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/14-13.htm">Judges 14:13</a> captures Samson offering a high-stakes wager that tests Philistine pride, exposes human limitation, and sets the stage for God&#8217;s deliverance through unexpected means. The hefty payment of thirty garments signals the costliness of worldly confidence, while the Philistines&#8217; eagerness to hear the riddle reveals their misplaced trust in collective intellect. Through this single verse, Scripture shows that when God&#8217;s chosen servant confronts oppressive powers, even a riddle becomes a weapon, reminding believers that the Lord can use ordinary moments to accomplish extraordinary purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>;
