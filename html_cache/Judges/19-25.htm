The refusal to listen reflects a hardened heart and a rejection of hospitality norms, which were highly valued in ancient Near Eastern culture. This echoes the similar account in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where the men of Sodom refused to heed Lot's plea, illustrating a parallel in the depth of societal corruption.<p><b>So the Levite took his concubine and sent her outside to them,</b><br>The Levite's actions reveal a disturbing lack of protection and care for his concubine, highlighting the low status of women and concubines in ancient Israelite society. This act of sending her out is reminiscent of the offering of Lot's daughters in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, further emphasizing the moral decay. The Levite, a member of the priestly tribe, should have been a spiritual leader, yet his actions betray a failure to uphold God's standards of justice and mercy.<p><b>and they raped her and abused her throughout the night,</b><br>This tragic event underscores the extreme violence and inhumanity present in Gibeah, a city of the tribe of Benjamin. The phrase "throughout the night" indicates prolonged suffering, reflecting the depth of human depravity. This incident serves as a grim reminder of the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God and the absence of righteous leadership. It foreshadows the eventual judgment and near destruction of the tribe of Benjamin in the subsequent chapters.<p><b>and at dawn they let her go.</b><br>The release of the concubine at dawn signifies the end of her torment but also highlights the callousness of her abusers, who only cease their violence with the coming of daylight. Dawn often symbolizes new beginnings or hope in Scripture, yet here it starkly contrasts with the horror of the preceding night. This moment serves as a prelude to the Levite's response and the ensuing civil war, illustrating the far-reaching consequences of sin and the need for repentance and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Levi, who was traveling with his concubine.
