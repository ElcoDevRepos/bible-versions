The tent is significant in ancient Near Eastern culture as a place of hospitality and refuge. Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, is in a position of power as she stands at the entrance, a role typically reserved for the man of the house. This setting foreshadows the unexpected turn of events, as tents were often associated with women&#8217;s domain, and Jael&#8217;s actions will subvert traditional gender roles.<p><b>he said,</b><br>Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite army, is the speaker here. His command reflects his desperation and vulnerability after being defeated by the Israelites under Deborah and Barak. This moment highlights the reversal of fortunes, as a once-powerful leader is now seeking refuge and relying on a woman for protection.<p><b>&#8220;and if anyone comes and asks you,</b><br>This anticipates the possibility of pursuit by Barak and his forces. The phrase underscores the urgency and danger of Sisera&#8217;s situation. It also sets the stage for Jael&#8217;s pivotal role in the narrative, as she must decide whether to comply with Sisera&#8217;s request or act in accordance with God&#8217;s deliverance of Israel.<p><b>&#8216;Is there a man here?&#8217;</b><br>The question reflects the cultural norms of the time, where men were the primary targets in warfare. Sisera&#8217;s concern is for his own safety, assuming that his presence would be the primary interest of any pursuers. This also highlights the irony of the situation, as the expected threat is from men, yet it is a woman who will ultimately defeat him.<p><b>say, &#8216;No.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Sisera instructs Jael to lie, which is a common tactic in warfare and survival situations. This command places Jael in a moral and ethical dilemma, as lying is generally condemned in biblical teaching. However, her subsequent actions align with God&#8217;s deliverance plan for Israel, illustrating the complexity of moral decisions in the context of divine providence. This moment foreshadows Jael&#8217;s decisive action, which will fulfill Deborah&#8217;s prophecy that a woman would claim the victory over Sisera.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jael.htm">Jael</a></b><br>The wife of Heber the Kenite, who plays a crucial role in the defeat of Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite army.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>The commander of the Canaanite army under King Jabin, who flees to Jael's tent seeking refuge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heber_the_kenite.htm">Heber the Kenite</a></b><br>Jael's husband, who had separated from the other Kenites and pitched his tent near Kedesh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_jael.htm">Tent of Jael</a></b><br>The setting where Jael offers Sisera refuge, ultimately leading to his demise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_oppression.htm">Canaanite Oppression</a></b><br>The broader context of the account, where the Israelites are oppressed by King Jabin of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_unexpected_roles.htm">Courage in Unexpected Roles</a></b><br>Jael's actions remind us that God can use anyone, regardless of their societal role, to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_wisdom.htm">Discernment and Wisdom</a></b><br>Jael's decision to deceive Sisera highlights the need for discernment in complex situations, seeking God's wisdom in our actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The account illustrates God's control over events, using even unlikely individuals to bring about His plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hospitality_and_deception.htm">Hospitality and Deception</a></b><br>The account challenges us to consider the ethics of hospitality and deception, urging us to align our actions with God's truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_through_weakness.htm">Victory through Weakness</a></b><br>Jael's victory over Sisera symbolizes how God often uses the weak and unexpected to achieve His purposes, encouraging us to trust in His strength rather than our own.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_4_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 4:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_4_20_God_s_plan_unexpected_people.htm">How does Judges 4:20 demonstrate God's use of unexpected people for His plans?

Similar strategic use of a doorway shows up when Rahab stands between the spies and danger in <a href="/joshua/2-4.htm">Joshua 2:4&#8211;6</a>.<p>&#8226; The tent entrance in nomadic culture was a private space; by stationing Jael there, Sisera believes he can hide within while she shields him&#8212;much like Lot standing at his door in <a href="/genesis/19-6.htm">Genesis 19:6&#8211;7</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s larger storyline is already in motion: Deborah has prophesied that Sisera will fall at the hand of a woman (<a href="/judges/4-9.htm">Judges 4:9</a>). The very place he thinks is safe becomes the place of his judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said</b><p>&#8226; The narrative underscores that these instructions originate with Sisera, not with God. Scripture records human words accurately, even when those words reflect fear or sin (compare Saul&#8217;s panicked command in <a href="/1_samuel/28-22.htm">1 Samuel 28:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Sisera&#8217;s voice is full of self-confidence, yet the previous verse says he is &#8220;exhausted&#8221; (<a href="/judges/4-19.htm">Judges 4:19</a>). His directives expose the emptiness of relying on human strength apart from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And if anyone comes and asks you</b><p>&#8226; Sisera anticipates pursuit; Barak and the Israelite troops are sweeping the area (<a href="/judges/4-16.htm">Judges 4:16</a>). His anxiety mirrors Pharaoh&#8217;s soldiers cornered at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; God often lets the proud recognize, too late, that they are being hunted by divine justice (<a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is there a man here?</b><p>&#8226; The specific wording shows Sisera knows exactly what will be asked: his enemies are looking for a single man. Ironically, Scripture soon describes him as no longer a threat at all (<a href="/judges/4-22.htm">Judges 4:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The question recalls the men of Sodom asking, &#8220;Where are the men who came to you?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/19-5.htm">Genesis 19:5</a>). Both incidents involve a householder being pressured about hidden guests, yet God overturns evil intentions in each case.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Say, &#8216;No.&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; Sisera instructs Jael to lie, paralleling other biblical moments where someone is asked to conceal the presence of God&#8217;s people (<a href="/2_samuel/17-20.htm">2 Samuel 17:20</a>). The Bible reports these deceptions without endorsing them; it simply portrays what happened.<p>&#8226; Jael&#8217;s forthcoming act of killing Sisera (<a href="/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>) is not prompted by his command but by God&#8217;s providential plan. Sisera&#8217;s last recorded word is &#8220;No,&#8221; a denial that seals his fate.<p>&#8226; God employs even human deceit and folly to accomplish His sovereign purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>), proving that no scheme can thwart His will (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/4-20.htm">Judges 4:20</a> captures a desperate commander trying to orchestrate his own salvation by placing Jael on watch, scripting her answers, and trusting a lie. Each phrase highlights his misplaced confidence, contrasts human schemes with divine sovereignty, and sets the stage for God&#8217;s prophetic victory through an unexpected instrument&#8212;Jael. The verse reminds us that no matter how carefully sin plots its escape, God&#8217;s judgment and deliverance unfold exactly as He has spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Stand.</span>--The imperative here used has the masculine, not the feminine termination, but probably only because it is used generally.<p><span class= "bld">That thou shalt say, No.</span>--In that age, and among those nations, and under such circumstances, a lie would have been regarded as perfectly natural and justifiable; even under the Christian dispensation, many casuists declare a lie for self-preservation to be venial, though it is to be hoped that there are millions who, without condemning such a falsehood in <span class= "ital">others, </span>would suffer any extremity rather than be guilty of it themselves. Under any circumstances, it would be very unfair to judge by the standard of Christianity the words and actions of ignorant nomads and idolatrous Canaanites, more than a thousand years before Christ.
