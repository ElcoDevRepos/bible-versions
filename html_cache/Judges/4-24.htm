In the context of Judges, it reflects the cyclical pattern of Israel's history during the time of the judges, where periods of oppression were followed by deliverance and victory. The strengthening of Israel's hand can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to give them victory over their enemies when they are obedient to Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>). This growing strength is also a testament to God's faithfulness in empowering His people despite their previous disobedience.<p><b>against Jabin king of Canaan</b><br>Jabin was a title used for the king of Hazor, a major Canaanite city. Historically, Hazor was a significant city-state in northern Canaan, and archaeological evidence supports its prominence during this period. The mention of Jabin connects this narrative to earlier biblical accounts, such as <a href="/joshua/11.htm">Joshua 11</a>, where another Jabin, king of Hazor, was defeated by Joshua. This suggests a recurring theme of conflict between Israel and the Canaanite powers, symbolizing the ongoing struggle between God's people and the forces opposed to His rule.<p><b>until they destroyed him</b><br>The complete destruction of Jabin signifies the total victory granted by God to the Israelites. This destruction is not just a military victory but also a spiritual triumph, as it represents the eradication of Canaanite influence and idolatry from among the Israelites. The phrase echoes the divine mandate given to Israel to drive out the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>, where believers are assured of victory through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were under oppression by Jabin, king of Canaan.
