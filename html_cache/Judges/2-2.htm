The Canaanites practiced religions that were abominable to God, and making covenants with them would risk Israel adopting these practices. This directive echoes earlier commands in <a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32-33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>, where God warned against forming treaties with the inhabitants of the Promised Land. The prohibition against covenants underscores the importance of spiritual purity and loyalty to God alone.<p><b>but you shall tear down their altars.</b><br>The command to destroy Canaanite altars was intended to eliminate the temptation of idol worship. Altars were central to the religious practices of the Canaanites, often associated with the worship of Baal and Asherah. By tearing them down, Israel would demonstrate their rejection of false gods and their commitment to Yahweh. This act of destruction was both a physical and symbolic cleansing of the land, aligning with God's holiness. Similar instructions are found in <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>, emphasizing the need to eradicate idolatry completely.<p><b>Yet you have not obeyed My voice.</b><br>This statement highlights Israel's disobedience and failure to follow God's clear instructions. Despite witnessing God's power and faithfulness, the Israelites repeatedly fell into the sin of compromise. Their disobedience led to spiritual and moral decline, as seen throughout the Book of Judges. This phrase serves as a reminder of the consequences of ignoring God's commands and the importance of obedience in maintaining a covenant relationship with Him.<p><b>What is this you have done?</b><br>This rhetorical question from God underscores the gravity of Israel's actions and invites reflection on their unfaithfulness. It echoes the divine questioning seen in <a href="/genesis/3-13.htm">Genesis 3:13</a>, where God asked Eve about her disobedience. The question is not for God's benefit but to prompt the Israelites to recognize their sin and its impact. It serves as a call to repentance and a reminder of the covenant responsibilities they have neglected.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were commanded to conquer the land of Canaan and remain faithful to God's covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanites.htm">The Canaanites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land whom the Israelites were instructed not to make covenants with, due to their idolatrous practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who delivers God's rebuke to the Israelites for their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land, which the Israelites were to inhabit and purify from idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars.htm">Altars</a></b><br>Structures used for worship, which the Israelites were commanded to destroy to prevent idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure to obey God's command to destroy the altars led to spiritual compromise.
