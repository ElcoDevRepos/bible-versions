Nighttime was a period when lawlessness could prevail, as seen in other biblical accounts such as the betrayal of Jesus (<a href="/john/13-30.htm">John 13:30</a>). The cover of darkness provided an opportunity for the men of Gibeah to carry out their wicked plans without immediate repercussions.<p><b>the men of Gibeah rose up against me</b><br>Gibeah was a city in the territory of Benjamin. The men of Gibeah rising up indicates a collective action, suggesting a deep-seated moral corruption within the community. This event echoes the depravity found in Sodom (Genesis 19), highlighting a recurring theme of societal decay in the absence of righteous leadership.<p><b>and surrounded the house</b><br>The act of surrounding the house signifies an aggressive and hostile intent, reminiscent of the siege tactics used in warfare. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to depict overwhelming danger or judgment (<a href="/2_kings/6-14.htm">2 Kings 6:14</a>). It underscores the severity of the threat faced by the Levite and his concubine.<p><b>They intended to kill me</b><br>The intention to kill reflects the extreme violence and lawlessness of the men of Gibeah. This mirrors the broader theme of the book of Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>), illustrating the chaos and moral decline during this period.<p><b>but they abused my concubine, and she died</b><br>The abuse and subsequent death of the concubine is a tragic and brutal act that highlights the devaluation of human life and dignity. This event serves as a catalyst for the ensuing civil war among the tribes of Israel. It also parallels the story of the Levite's concubine with the account of the unnamed woman in <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>, where the violation of Dinah leads to conflict. The concubine's death is a stark reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for justice and righteousness, themes that are ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who came to restore and redeem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_of_gibeah.htm">Leaders of Gibeah</a></b><br>These were the men responsible for the heinous act against the Levite's concubine.
