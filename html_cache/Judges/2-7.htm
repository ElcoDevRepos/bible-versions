Joshua's leadership is marked by obedience to God, as seen in the conquest of Canaan. His influence ensured that the people remained faithful to the covenant with God. The period of Joshua's leadership is characterized by unity and commitment to God's commands, as seen in <a href="/joshua/24-31.htm">Joshua 24:31</a>, which parallels this verse. Joshua's role as a type of Christ is evident in his name, which means "The LORD is salvation," prefiguring Jesus' role as the Savior.<p><b>and of the elders who outlived him</b><br>The elders mentioned here were leaders who had firsthand experience of God's miraculous works during the Exodus and the conquest of Canaan. Their leadership helped maintain the spiritual and moral direction of the nation after Joshua's death. This continuity of leadership underscores the importance of godly leadership in maintaining faithfulness to God. The elders' role can be compared to the apostles in the New Testament, who continued Jesus' mission after His ascension.<p><b>who had seen all the great works that the LORD had done for Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of witnessing God's mighty acts, which included the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, the provision of manna, and the victories in Canaan. These events were foundational to Israel's identity and faith. The firsthand experience of these miracles reinforced the elders' faith and their ability to lead the people. This concept of witnessing God's works is echoed in the New Testament, where the apostles are witnesses to Jesus' resurrection and miracles, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.
