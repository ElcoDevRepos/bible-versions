It was originally called Kiriath Arba and is one of the oldest cities in the world. The allocation of Hebron to Caleb by the tribe of Judah fulfills the promise made to him and demonstrates the tribal leadership and inheritance practices in ancient Israel. Hebron later becomes a city of refuge and a Levitical city, further emphasizing its importance.<p><b>who drove out the descendants of the three sons of Anak</b><br>The descendants of Anak, known as the Anakim, were a race of giants mentioned in <a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>.

Caleb's successful expulsion of these formidable inhabitants is a testament to his faith and courage, as well as God's faithfulness in enabling His people to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.
