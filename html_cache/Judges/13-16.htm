This figure appears at critical moments, such as with Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). The angel's presence indicates divine intervention and guidance.<p><b>&#8220;Even if I stay, I will not eat your food.</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and covenant. The angel's refusal to eat signifies that this encounter is not about human hospitality but divine instruction. It emphasizes the sacredness of the moment and the angel's heavenly origin, as seen in similar instances with angels in <a href="/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a> and <a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41-43</a>.<p><b>But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>The burnt offering was a common form of sacrifice in Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God (Leviticus 1). The angel redirects Manoah's intention from hospitality to worship, highlighting the importance of offering sacrifices to God alone. This instruction aligns with the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>For Manoah did not know that it was the angel of the LORD.</b><br>Manoah's lack of recognition underscores the mystery and majesty of divine encounters. This theme is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as Jacob wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>) and the disciples on the road to Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13-32</a>).

God graciously meets us, but He is never obligated to conform to human expectations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will not eat your food</b><p>He declines the hospitality Manoah offers, underscoring that the heavenly messenger is not a mere traveler in need of refreshment.<p>&#8226; God is self-sufficient (<a href="/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Angels do eat in certain visions (<a href="/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>), but here the refusal guards Manoah from confusing fellowship with worship (<a href="/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But if you prepare a burnt offering</b><p>The shift from a common meal to a sacrificial act redirects Manoah&#8217;s focus from social courtesy to true devotion. A burnt offering signified total consecration (<a href="/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1-9</a>). Gideon received similar guidance when the angel told him to lay out a sacrifice instead of serving a meal (<a href="/judges/6-17.htm">Judges 6:17-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Offer it to the LORD</b><p>The angel insists that worship must be aimed solely at Yahweh, not at the messenger.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a> reminds Israel to have no other gods before Him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a> echoes this exclusivity when the commander of the LORD&#8217;s army tells Joshua that worship belongs to God alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For Manoah did not know that it was the angel of the LORD</b><p>This parenthetical note explains Manoah&#8217;s confusion; he thought he was entertaining a prophet or dignitary. <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> later encourages believers that some &#8220;have entertained angels unaware,&#8221; highlighting God&#8217;s hidden workings. Only after the angel ascends in the flame (<a href="/judges/13-20.htm">Judges 13:20-21</a>) does Manoah grasp the visitor&#8217;s true identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a> teaches that God graciously engages human beings yet guards His glory. Manoah&#8217;s hospitality was admirable, but true honor belonged to the LORD through sacrifice, not to the heavenly messenger through shared food. The verse calls believers to direct every act of devotion to God alone, recognizing His holiness and self-sufficiency while trusting His patient guidance when we do not yet see clearly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Thou must offer it unto the Lord.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">a burnt offering unto the Lord thou mayest offer it. </span>(Comp. <a href="/judges/6-20.htm" title="And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.

The angel, perhaps perceiving that Manoah was in doubt as to who he might be, had a holy dread lest he might offer the kid to him, just as the angel whom St. John was about to worship said, "See thou do it not" (<a href="/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>); and Barnabas and Paul ran in among the people of Lycaonia to restrain them from offering sacrifice to them (<a href="/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14-18</a>). The order of the words, which is rightly given in the A.V., makes it a clear direction to offer the sacrifice to no one but the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/13-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the Angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1448;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
