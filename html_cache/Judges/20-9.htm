Gibeah, a city in the territory of Benjamin, is central to the narrative due to the grievous sin committed there, reminiscent of Sodom's wickedness (Genesis 19). The Israelites' resolve to act against Gibeah reflects a broader theme of communal responsibility and justice in the face of moral corruption. This decision underscores the severity of the crime and the necessity for decisive action, aligning with the biblical principle of purging evil from among the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>).<p><b>We will go against it</b><br>This phrase highlights the intention to confront and address the sin directly. The Israelites' approach to Gibeah is not merely punitive but also serves as a warning to the nation about the consequences of moral decay. The act of going against Gibeah can be seen as a form of divine judgment, where the Israelites act as instruments of God's justice. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God uses His people to execute judgment, such as the conquest of Canaan (Joshua 6).<p><b>as the lot dictates.</b><br>The use of casting lots indicates a reliance on divine guidance to determine the course of action. Casting lots was a common biblical practice to discern God's will, seen in decisions like the division of the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>) and the selection of Saul as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20-21</a>). This method underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and the desire to align human actions with divine purposes. It reflects a trust in God's providence, ensuring that the decision to attack Gibeah is not based on human impulse but on divine direction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin, where a grievous crime was committed against a Levite's concubine, leading to a call for justice by the other tribes of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A man whose concubine was abused and killed in Gibeah, sparking outrage and a call for retribution among the tribes of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribes_of_israel.htm">The Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The collective tribes, excluding Benjamin, who gathered to address the atrocity committed in Gibeah and sought to bring justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_benjamin.htm">The Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>The tribe that defended the inhabitants of Gibeah, leading to a civil conflict with the other tribes of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_at_mizpah.htm">The Assembly at Mizpah</a></b><br>The gathering of the Israelite tribes to discuss and decide on the course of action against Gibeah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_justice.htm">The Importance of Justice</a></b><br>The Israelites' decision to act against Gibeah underscores the necessity of addressing sin and injustice within a community.

This is like the decision of the Amphictyonic counsel against the guilty city of Crissa (Grote, iv. 85). But perhaps it should be rendered "we will cast the lot upon it," to divide its territory when conquered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We will go up by lot against it</span>. The words <span class="accented">we will go up</span> are not in the Hebrew, but are supplied by the Septuagint, who very likely found in their Hebrew copy the word <span class="accented">na'aleh</span>, we will go up, which has since (perchance) fallen out of the Hebrew text from its resemblance to the following word '<span class="accented">aleha</span> against it. The sense will then be, Not one of us will shrink from the dangers of the war; but we will cast lots who shall go up against Gibeah, and who shall be employed in collecting victuals for the army, 40,000 having to be told off for the latter service. And exactly in the same spirit (if indeed the answer was not actually given by lot) they inquired of the Lord who should go up first (in ver. 18), and, we may presume also, who should follow in the subsequent attacks, though this is omitted for brevity. Others, however, think the words <span class="accented">against it by lot</span> are purposely abrupt, and that the meaning is that Israel would deal with Gibeah as they had done with the Canaanites, viz., destroy their city, and divide its territory by lot among the other tribes, after the analogy of <a href="/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8-10</a>. But this interpretation is not borne out by what actually happened, nor is the phrase a likely one to have been used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1429;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we will do</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Gibeah:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(lag&#183;gi&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1390.htm">Strong's 1390: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gibeah -- 'hill', three cities in Palestine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">We will go against it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1462;&#1430;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;le&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as the lot dictates.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1486.htm">Strong's 1486: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lot -- a lot (for casting)</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/20-9.htm">OT History: Judges 20:9 But now this is the thing which (Jd Judg.
