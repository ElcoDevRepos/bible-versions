Jerusalem, at this time, was a Jebusite city, not yet the central city of Israel. This battle signifies the beginning of Judah's efforts to establish dominance in the region. The mention of Judah highlights the tribe's prominence, as it is from Judah that King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come, fulfilling the prophecy of the scepter not departing from Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>).<p><b>and captured it.</b><br>The capture of Jerusalem by Judah indicates a temporary victory, as the city would later be recaptured by the Jebusites until King David's reign (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-7</a>). This reflects the ongoing struggle for control in the region and the incomplete nature of the conquest during the period of the Judges. The capture also foreshadows Jerusalem's future significance as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<p><b>They put the city to the sword</b><br>This phrase indicates a complete military victory, involving the destruction of the inhabitants. Such actions were common in ancient warfare and were often seen as a means of purifying the land from pagan influences, in accordance with God's commands to Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This act of putting the city to the sword underscores the severity of the conquest and the fulfillment of divine judgment against the Canaanite peoples.<p><b>and set it on fire.</b><br>Burning the city was a symbolic act of total destruction, ensuring that it could not be easily reoccupied or used as a stronghold against Israel. Fire often represents judgment and purification in the Bible, and here it signifies the removal of idolatrous practices associated with the Jebusites. This destruction prefigures the ultimate purification and renewal that will come through Christ, who will establish a new Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_judah.htm">Men of Judah</a></b><br>The tribe of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its leadership and strength.

Such judgment underscores the seriousness of Canaanite sin and God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also shows that Judah was carrying out God&#8217;s explicit wartime instructions, not acting from personal vengeance (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, it serves as a sober reminder that sin brings real judgment, while pointing forward to Christ who bore that judgment for us (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set it on fire</b><p>&#8226; Burning a conquered city signified total defeat and removed pagan strongholds (<a href="/joshua/8-28.htm">Joshua 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Fire often marks divine judgment in Scripture&#8212;consider Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) and later Jerusalem&#8217;s own fall to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By destroying the city, Judah prevented the immediate re-establishment of idolatry, yet the incomplete occupation left room for its eventual re-emergence, illustrating the cost of half-measures (<a href="/judges/3-5.htm">Judges 3:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a> records Judah&#8217;s swift obedience: they attack, take, and destroy Jerusalem as God directed.

Yet the later resurgence of Jebusite control exposes Israel&#8217;s pattern of incomplete obedience, warning us that genuine faith follows through fully. At the same time, the passage anticipates Judah&#8217;s future King&#8212;David&#8212;and ultimately the Messiah, through whom God will claim a lasting, unshakable kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Now.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And.</span><p><span class= "bld">Had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it.</span>--Our version here most unwarrantably interpolates the word "<span class= "ital">had," </span>meaning it perhaps as a sort of explanatory gloss to imply that the conquest took place before the fact mentioned in the last verse.
