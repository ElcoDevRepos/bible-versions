It highlights the theological foundation of Israel's actions, attributing their victories to divine intervention rather than human strength. This is consistent with the broader biblical narrative where God is seen as the ultimate deliverer and protector of His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>.<p><b>delivered Sihon and all his people</b><br>Sihon was the king of the Amorites, a significant Canaanite group. The term "delivered" indicates a divine act of judgment against Sihon and his people, fulfilling God's promise to give the land to Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-36</a>). This act of deliverance is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God intervenes on behalf of Israel against their enemies.<p><b>into the hand of Israel,</b><br>The phrase "into the hand of" signifies complete control or victory. It reflects the biblical motif of God granting His people victory over their adversaries, as seen in <a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>. This victory is not just military but also spiritual, as it demonstrates God's faithfulness to His covenant promises.<p><b>who defeated them.</b><br>This succinct statement of victory underscores the effectiveness of God's deliverance. The defeat of Sihon and his people is a testament to God's power and Israel's obedience to His commands. It also serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of opposing God's chosen people.<p><b>So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites</b><br>The taking possession of the land fulfills the Abrahamic covenant promise of land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). It also signifies a transition from nomadic life to settlement, which is crucial for the development of Israel as a nation. This act of taking possession is a type of the ultimate inheritance believers receive through Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>.<p><b>who inhabited that country,</b><br>This phrase indicates the geographical and cultural context of the conquest. The Amorites were a dominant group in Canaan, and their defeat marked a significant shift in the region's power dynamics. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of Amorite settlements, providing historical context to the biblical narrative. The conquest of their land is a precursor to the broader conquest of Canaan, as detailed in the book of Joshua.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who actively intervenes in the history of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, led by Jephthah at this time, engaged in conflict with the Amorites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a></b><br>The king of the Amorites, who opposed Israel and was defeated by them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of people living in the land that Israel was to possess, representing opposition to God's promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_the_amorites.htm">The Land of the Amorites</a></b><br>The territory that Israel took possession of after defeating Sihon and his people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of history and the affairs of nations.
