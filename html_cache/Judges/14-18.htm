The men of the city, the Philistines, were under pressure to solve Samson's riddle to avoid the consequences of their wager. This reflects the cultural practice of riddles and challenges in ancient times, often used to demonstrate wisdom or cunning. The urgency before sunset indicates their desperation and the importance of the deadline.<p><b>&#8220;What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?&#8221;</b><br>The riddle's answer is directly tied to Samson's earlier encounter with a lion, where he killed it and later found bees and honey in its carcass. Honey, often a symbol of abundance and pleasure in the Bible, contrasts with the strength and ferocity of a lion, a common symbol of power. This phrase highlights the Philistines' cunning in extracting the answer from Samson's wife, reflecting the theme of betrayal and deceit.<p><b>So he said to them:</b><br>Samson's response is immediate and accusatory, indicating his awareness of their deceit. This interaction underscores the tension between Samson and the Philistines, setting the stage for further conflict. It also reflects the personal nature of the betrayal, as it involves his wife.<p><b>&#8220;If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle!&#8221;</b><br>The metaphor of "plowing with my heifer" is a vivid expression of betrayal, suggesting that the Philistines used his wife to manipulate and deceive him. In ancient agricultural societies, a heifer was a valuable asset, and the metaphor implies misuse of something precious to Samson. This phrase also foreshadows the ongoing conflict between Samson and the Philistines, as it reveals the personal and communal tensions that drive the narrative. The use of agricultural imagery connects to the agrarian context of the time, where such metaphors would be readily understood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.

Samson&#8217;s reply unmasks their betrayal of marital trust and highlights that only by illicit means could they &#8220;solve&#8221; what God had hidden. The episode demonstrates that human scheming cannot thwart the Lord; rather, He turns even deceit into a catalyst for judging His enemies and advancing His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">What is sweeter than honey?</span>--Their answer is given in the same rhythmical form as the riddle itself.<p><span class= "bld">If ye had not plowed with my heifer.</span>--Many commentators, following Rabbi Levi Ben Gershom, read in this proverbial phrase an implication that Samson suspected his wife of adultery; but there is no sufficient reason for this view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of the city</span> - the same as were spoken of in ver. 11 as Samson's companions. <span class="cmt_word">Before the sun went down</span> - just in time, therefore, to save the wager, as defined in ver. 12. This is the uncommon word for the sun used also in <a href="/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13</a>, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">What is sweeter</span>, etc. They put their answer in a form to make it seem as if they had guessed the riddle; but Samson instantly perceived his wife's treachery, and showed that he did so by quoting the proverb of plowing with another person s heifer. They had not used their own wit to find out the riddle, but had learnt the secret at Samson's cost, through his wife. He insinuates that had they acted fairly he would have won the wager. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/14-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Before</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1496;&#1462;&#1433;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7789;e&#183;rem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
