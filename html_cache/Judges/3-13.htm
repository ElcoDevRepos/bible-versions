The Ammonites, descendants of Lot, often conflicted with Israel (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36-38</a>). The Amalekites, descendants of Esau, were known for their persistent enmity against Israel, first attacking them in <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>. This alliance highlights the recurring theme of Israel's neighbors uniting against them, a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Eglon attacked and defeated Israel</b><br>Eglon's attack represents a period of judgment upon Israel due to their disobedience and idolatry, as outlined earlier in <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>. The defeat signifies God's allowance of foreign oppression as a means to bring Israel to repentance. This cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is a central theme in the Book of Judges.<p><b>taking possession of the City of Palms</b><br>The "City of Palms" refers to Jericho, a city with significant biblical history. Jericho was the first city conquered by Israel under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 6). Its capture by Eglon symbolizes a reversal of Israel's earlier victories and a loss of the blessings they had received. Jericho's strategic location made it a valuable asset for controlling trade routes and exerting influence in the region.

The alliance with Ammon and Amalek shows God&#8217;s sovereign hand permitting a coalition of long-standing foes&#8212;Moab to the east, Ammon just north of Moab, and the nomadic Amalekites of the south (<a href="/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; These nations trace back to relationships hostile to Israel from the start (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36-38</a>; <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). By rallying them, Eglon multiplied military pressure far beyond what Moab alone could exert.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us how sin removes divine protection: &#8220;The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of their enemies&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>). Israel&#8217;s disobedience opened the door for this three-pronged threat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eglon attacked and defeated Israel</b><p>&#8226; The onslaught was decisive: &#8220;you shall flee before your enemies&#8221; had been Moses&#8217; warning if Israel broke covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>). <a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a> shows that warning fulfilled.<p>&#8226; Notice the progression in Judges: sin (3:7), servitude (3:8-14), supplication (3:15), salvation (3:15-30), and serenity (3:30). Verse 13 sits in the servitude stage, emphasizing how far Israel had fallen since Joshua&#8217;s victories.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s purpose in allowing defeat was corrective, not destructive. He disciplines &#8220;those He loves&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).

For it to fall back into enemy hands highlights the depth of Israel&#8217;s spiritual decline.<p>&#8226; Jericho&#8217;s fertile oasis and strategic location near the Jordan crossing gave Moab a forward base to tax trade, control movement, and humiliate Israel.<p>&#8226; The reversal is sobering: the walls God once brought down for His people now shelter their oppressor. Yet it also sets up God&#8217;s power to reverse fortunes again (<a href="/2_kings/14-26.htm">2 Kings 14:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a> shows God permitting King Eglon&#8217;s tri-nation alliance to punish a wayward Israel.

Yet even in judgment, the stage is set for grace: the same Lord who allowed Moabite dominion will soon raise up Ehud and restore the land, proving His faithfulness to discipline, deliver, and keep covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The children of Ammon.</span>--They were closely allied with the Moabites by affinities of race and character.
