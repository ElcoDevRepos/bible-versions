This is consistent with other Old Testament appearances, such as to Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). The woman here is Manoah's wife, who remains unnamed in the text, highlighting her role rather than her identity. This appearance occurs in the region of Zorah, within the territory of the tribe of Dan, during a time when Israel was oppressed by the Philistines.<p><b>and said to her,</b><br>The direct communication from the angel signifies the importance of the message. In biblical narratives, divine messages often come with significant implications for the individual and the nation of Israel. This encounter is reminiscent of other biblical announcements of miraculous births, such as those to Sarah (<a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>).<p><b>&#8220;It is true that you are barren and have no children;</b><br>Barrenness was a significant social and personal issue in ancient Israel, often seen as a source of shame or divine disfavor. The acknowledgment of her barrenness sets the stage for a miraculous intervention, emphasizing God's power to bring life where there is none. This theme of God overcoming barrenness is seen in the stories of Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Hannah.<p><b>but you will conceive and give birth to a son.</b><br>This promise of a son is a direct intervention by God, indicating that the child will have a special purpose. The birth of Samson, the son in question, is part of God's plan to begin delivering Israel from Philistine oppression. This announcement parallels the birth of other significant biblical figures, such as Isaac, Samuel, and John the Baptist, each of whom played a crucial role in God's redemptive history. The promise also foreshadows the ultimate miraculous birth of Jesus Christ, who would deliver humanity from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger often seen as a theophany, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, who delivers God's message to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman (Manoah's Wife)</a></b><br>Although unnamed in the text, she is the wife of Manoah and the mother of Samson.
