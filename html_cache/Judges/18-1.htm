The absence of a king indicates a period of decentralized leadership, where Israel was governed by judges. This lack of centralized authority often led to moral and social chaos, as seen throughout the Book of Judges. The repeated mention of "no king" in Judges (17:6, 18:1, 19:1, 21:25) underscores the need for righteous leadership, foreshadowing Israel's eventual demand for a monarchy. This period is marked by a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance, highlighting the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to God without strong leadership.<p><b>and the tribe of the Danites was looking for territory to occupy</b><br>The Danites' search for territory reflects their failure to fully conquer the land allotted to them in <a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>. This failure is attributed to their inability to drive out the Amorites (<a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34-35</a>), demonstrating a lack of faith and obedience to God's command to possess the land. The Danites' quest for new territory illustrates the broader theme of incomplete conquest and disobedience among the tribes of Israel. This search also foreshadows their eventual migration northward, where they would establish a new settlement in Laish, later renamed Dan (<a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27-29</a>).<p><b>For up to that time they had not come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights the Danites' unique situation among the tribes. While each tribe was allotted a specific inheritance in the Promised Land, the Danites struggled to secure theirs. This lack of inheritance is both a literal and spiritual issue, as it reflects their failure to trust in God's promises and fulfill their covenant responsibilities. The concept of inheritance is significant in biblical theology, symbolizing God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). The Danites' situation serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobedience and the importance of faith in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descendants of Dan, one of the twelve sons of Jacob.

But as long as any part of the tribe was not settled, the tribe as such, in its unity, was still seeking a settlement. The land for their inheritance had not yet fallen to the tribe in its integrity. This is in part accounted for by what we read <a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>, that the Amorites would not suffer the children of Dan to come down to the valley, so that those who could not get possession of their land there would be crowded into other parts of the tribal territory.
