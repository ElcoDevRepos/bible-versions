The grapevine, or vine, is personified, symbolizing a refusal to abandon its purpose. The vine is often a symbol of Israel (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>) and represents fruitfulness and blessing. The reply indicates a sense of purpose and contentment in fulfilling its God-given role.<p><b>Should I stop giving my wine</b><br>Wine in biblical times was a staple of the diet and a symbol of joy and celebration (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). It was used in religious ceremonies and offerings (<a href="/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>). The rhetorical question highlights the absurdity of abandoning a beneficial and divinely appointed role. The vine's wine is a metaphor for the blessings and joy that come from fulfilling one's purpose.<p><b>that cheers both God and man</b><br>Wine was used in offerings to God, symbolizing joy and fellowship with Him (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-10</a>). It also brought joy to people, being a central part of feasts and celebrations (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>). This dual aspect underscores the vine's importance in both divine and human contexts, suggesting that fulfilling one's role brings joy to both God and humanity.<p><b>to hold sway over the trees?</b><br>The phrase "to hold sway" implies ruling or having authority. The parable contrasts the vine's contentment in its role with the ambition of Abimelech, who seeks power at any cost. The trees represent the people of Shechem and their desire for a king. The vine's refusal to rule highlights the folly of seeking power for its own sake, a theme echoed in Jesus' teachings on servanthood and humility (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vine.htm">The Vine</a></b><br>In this parable, the vine represents a character that is offered a position of leadership but declines, valuing its current role and contributions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, Jotham is the youngest son of Gideon (Jerubbaal) who survived the massacre of his brothers by Abimelech.
