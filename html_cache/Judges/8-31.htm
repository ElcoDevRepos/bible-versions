Concubines were often taken for various reasons, including political alliances, social status, or to bear children. The presence of concubines in biblical narratives often highlights the complexities and moral challenges of the time, reflecting the patriarchal society and the deviation from God's original design for marriage.<p><b>who dwelt in Shechem</b><br>Shechem was a significant city in the central hill country of Canaan, located in the tribal territory of Ephraim. It held historical and religious importance, being the site where God first promised the land to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>) and where Joshua renewed the covenant with Israel (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>). The mention of Shechem here may indicate political or social motivations behind Gideon's relationship with the concubine, as Shechem was a center of power and influence.<p><b>also bore him a son</b><br>The birth of a son to Gideon's concubine signifies the continuation of his lineage, but it also introduces potential conflict and division within his family. Sons born to concubines often faced issues of legitimacy and inheritance, which could lead to strife, as seen in the subsequent narrative of Abimelech.<p><b>and he named him Abimelech</b><br>The name Abimelech means "my father is king," which is significant given Gideon's refusal to accept kingship over Israel (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>). This name may reflect Gideon's aspirations or the expectations placed upon Abimelech. Abimelech's later actions, as recorded in <a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>, reveal his ambition to rule, leading to violence and tragedy. This narrative foreshadows the dangers of human ambition and the rejection of God's authority, serving as a cautionary tale about the consequences of straying from divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon (Jerubbaal)</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory over the Midianites.

This mixed legacy foreshadows Abimelech&#8217;s later rise and bloodshed in the same city (<a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1-6</a>).<p>- Gideon&#8217;s concubine remaining in Shechem suggests he kept her at a distance, creating a relational divide that Abimelech would later exploit (<a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Also bore him a son</b><p>- Despite Gideon&#8217;s earlier declaration, &#8220;I will not rule over you&#8230; the LORD shall rule over you&#8221; (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>), his expansive family structure mirrors that of Near-Eastern kings.<p>- The birth of this additional son sets up tension between the sons born in Ophrah and the son born in Shechem (<a href="/judges/9-5.htm">Judges 9:5</a>).<p>- Scripture shows that hidden or ignored areas of disobedience often bear painful fruit in the next generation (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he named him Abimelech</b><p>- Naming a child reflected parental hopes and identity (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>). Gideon&#8217;s choice of the name Abimelech&#8212;previously used of Philistine rulers (<a href="/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>; 26:1)&#8212;hints at royal aspirations, whether conscious or not.<p>- This name becomes prophetic: Abimelech later declares himself king and murders his brothers (<a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1-6</a>).<p>- The contrast is stark: Gideon refused the title of king verbally (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>), yet his actions and his son&#8217;s name suggest a different story, underscoring that words without consistent obedience breed confusion (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/8-31.htm">Judges 8:31</a> captures a seemingly small detail&#8212;one concubine, one city, one son&#8212;but each clause exposes cracks in Gideon&#8217;s legacy. His tolerated compromise (concubine), geographical distance (Shechem), expanded household (another son), and suggestive naming (Abimelech) converge to sow the seeds of the next chapter&#8217;s violence. Scripture records it plainly so we can see the unavoidable link between private choices and public consequences and be moved to wholehearted, consistent faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">His concubine that was in Shechem.</span>--In <a href="/judges/9-18.htm" title="And you are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, three score and ten persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)">Judges 9:18</a> she is contemptuously called his "maid servant." The sequel (<a href="/context/judges/9-1.htm" title="And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brothers, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,">Judges 9:1-4</a>) seems to show that she belonged to the Canaanite population of Shechem. If so, Gideon's conduct in making her a concubine was as much against the Mosaic law as that of Solomon, though it may have had the same colour of worldly expediency. But it is probable that the requirements of the Mosaic law were much better known in the reign of Solomon, when the priests had once more become influential, than they were in this anarchical period. This concubine exercised an influence sufficiently important to cause the preservation of her name by tradition--Drumah (Jos. <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 7, ? 1).<p><span class= "bld">Whose name he called Abimelech.</span>--For "called" the margin has <span class= "ital">set. </span>The phrase is not the ordinary one, and perhaps implies that Abimelech (Father-king--"a king, my father") was a surname given him by his father on observing his ambitious and boastful character. It seems more probable that the name was given by the Shechemites and his mother, and it may not have been without some influence for evil upon his ultimate career. The name has exactly the same significance as Padishah and Attalik, the title of the Khan of Bokhara (Gesenius). Being a well-understood dynastic title (Genesis 20; Psalms 34 title), it would be all the more significant. He was like a bad reproduction of Gideon, with the courage and energy of his father, but with none of his virtues.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose name he called</span>. This is badly translated; it should he, he <span class="accented">gave him the name of Abimelech - literally</span>, <span class="accented">he set his name Abimelech.</span> There are two phrases in Hebrew. The one, he <span class="accented">called his name</span> Seth, Noah, Ishmael, Isaac, Esau, Jacob, etc., as the case may be. And this is the phrase always, though not exclusively (see, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/genesis/35-10.htm">Genesis 35:10</a>; <a href="/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>), used of the name given to a child at its birth or circumcision. The other is, he <span class="accented">gave</span> or <span class="accented">set him the</span> name, or, <span class="accented">he gave</span> or <span class="accented">set his name</span> so-and-so, and this phrase is only used of additional names, or surnames given later in life. The examples are Judges 13:31; <a href="/2_kings/17-34.htm">2 Kings 17:34</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-7.htm">Daniel 2:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>. The inference is that the name of <span class="accented">Abimelech</span>, which means <span class="accented">father of a king</span>, and was the name of the royal family of Gerar, was given to Abimelech as a significant surname, and was perhaps one of the causes which induced him to seize the kingdom. A third phrase is found in <a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-4.htm">2 Chronicles 36:4</a>: <span class="accented">he turned his name to Jehoiakim</span>; <span class="accented">changed his name to Zedekiah.</span> The Hebrew is the same in all these passages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His concubine,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1500;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#238;&#183;la&#7713;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
