He is the son of Kenaz, who is Caleb's younger brother, indicating a close familial relationship with Caleb, a prominent leader from the tribe of Judah. This connection highlights the importance of family lineage and tribal affiliations in Israelite society. Othniel's capture of the city demonstrates his military prowess and leadership, setting the stage for his later role as Israel's first judge (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9-11</a>). The city in question is Debir, also known as Kiriath Sepher, which Caleb had previously offered as a challenge to the Israelites, promising his daughter in marriage to whoever captured it (<a href="/joshua/15-16.htm">Joshua 15:16-17</a>). This event underscores the practice of rewarding military success with marriage alliances, a common cultural practice in the ancient Near East.<p><b>and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage</b><br>Caleb's decision to give his daughter Acsah in marriage to Othniel is significant both culturally and theologically. In ancient Israel, marriages often served to strengthen family ties and consolidate power within tribes. Acsah's marriage to Othniel not only rewards Othniel's bravery but also ensures that Caleb's lineage remains strong and influential. This act reflects the patriarchal structure of the society, where fathers arranged marriages for their daughters. Theologically, this union can be seen as part of God's providential plan, as Othniel later becomes a deliverer for Israel, prefiguring the role of Christ as a deliverer and judge. The marriage also highlights the theme of faithfulness and reward, as Caleb, a man of faith who wholly followed the Lord (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>), sees his family blessed through Othniel's leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/othniel.htm">Othniel</a></b><br>He is the son of Kenaz and the younger brother of Caleb.

Othniel does not deliberate; he acts&#8212;much like Caleb did forty-five years earlier when he urged Israel to &#8220;go up at once&#8221; and take the land (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Othniel&#8217;s readiness prefigures his later role: &#8220;The LORD raised up Othniel son of Kenaz &#8230; so he became Israel&#8217;s judge&#8221; (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9-11</a>).

It is here added that he was Caleb's younger brother. (See <a href="/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>.) The Hebrew may mean either that Othniel was "son of Kenaz and brother of Caleb" (in which case he married his niece); or "son of Kenaz, who was Caleb's brother" (as in "Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother," <a href="/2_samuel/13-3.htm" title="But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.">2Samuel 13:3</a>), in which case Achsah was his cousin. The Masoretes, to whom is due the punctuation, &c., of our Hebrew Scriptures, show by their pointing that they understood the words in the <span class= "ital">former </span>sense. But though Ben-kenaz may simply mean Kenezite (<a href="/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/32-12.htm" title="Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.">Numbers 32:12</a>), it is strange in that case that Othniel should never be called a son of Jephunneh. If he was a brother of Caleb's, he must have lived to extreme old age, and have been an old man when he married Achsah. For the importance of Caleb's family, see <a href="/1_chronicles/27-15.htm" title="The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:15</a>.
