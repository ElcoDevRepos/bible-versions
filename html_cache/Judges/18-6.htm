The presence of a priest in this context highlights the religious practices of the time, where individuals often sought divine guidance through priests. This reflects the decentralized and often syncretistic religious practices during the period of the Judges, where there was no central place of worship, and everyone did what was right in their own eyes (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>). The priest's role here is significant as it shows the influence and authority religious figures held, even when not serving in an official capacity at the Tabernacle.<p><b>&#8220;Go in peace.</b><br>The phrase "Go in peace" is a common biblical expression of blessing and assurance. It indicates a desire for the well-being and safety of the travelers. This blessing is often used in the context of sending someone on a journey or mission, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/1-17.htm">1 Samuel 1:17</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/15-9.htm">2 Samuel 15:9</a>. It reflects a cultural emphasis on hospitality and the importance of peace as a divine gift.<p><b>The LORD is watching over your journey.&#8221;</b><br>This assurance from the priest suggests divine approval and protection over the Danites' expedition. The concept of God watching over a journey is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing God's omnipresence and providence (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>). However, in the broader context of Judges, this statement is ironic. The Danites' journey leads to the conquest of Laish and the establishment of idolatry, which is contrary to God's commandments. This highlights the tension between perceived divine approval and actual divine will, a common theme in the book of Judges where human actions often conflict with God's law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A Levite who was serving as a priest for Micah, a man from the hill country of Ephraim.
