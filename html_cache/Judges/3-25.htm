This delay highlights the cultural norms of privacy and respect for a king's personal space. The growing concern reflects the tension and suspense in the narrative, emphasizing the unexpected nature of divine deliverance through Ehud's actions.<p><b>and saw that he had still not opened the doors of the upper room.</b><br>The upper room, often used for private meetings or rest, signifies a place of vulnerability for Eglon. The locked doors symbolize a false sense of security, which is a recurring theme in Scripture where human defenses are inadequate against God's plans. The delay in opening the doors underscores the servants' hesitation and the dramatic irony of the situation.<p><b>Then they took the key and opened the doors&#8212;</b><br>Keys in ancient times were large and cumbersome, often a symbol of authority and control. The act of taking the key and opening the doors signifies a shift from passive waiting to active investigation. This moment marks the transition from ignorance to the revelation of Eglon's fate, paralleling moments in Scripture where hidden truths are unveiled.<p><b>and there was their lord lying dead on the floor.</b><br>The discovery of Eglon's body fulfills Ehud's mission and God's deliverance of Israel from Moabite oppression. The phrase "lying dead on the floor" starkly contrasts the king's former power and authority, illustrating the theme of divine justice. This scene foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Christ, who, unlike Eglon, conquers through His own death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed judge of Israel who delivered the Israelites from Moabite oppression by assassinating King Eglon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eglon.htm">Eglon</a></b><br>The king of Moab who oppressed Israel for eighteen years.
