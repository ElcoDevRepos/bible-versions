This interaction highlights the unique role of women in leadership during a time when male leadership was predominant. Deborah's position as a judge and prophetess is significant, as it demonstrates God's use of women to fulfill His purposes, similar to Miriam and later, Huldah.<p><b>If you will go with me, I will go</b><br>Barak's request for Deborah to accompany him suggests his reliance on her spiritual authority and guidance. This reflects the cultural context where prophets were seen as mediators of God's will. Barak's dependence on Deborah can be seen as a lack of confidence in his own leadership or as a recognition of the divine favor and wisdom she possesses. This mirrors the Israelites' dependence on God's presence, as seen in the Ark of the Covenant leading them in battle.<p><b>but if you will not go with me, I will not go</b><br>Barak's insistence on Deborah's presence underscores the importance of divine guidance in Israel's military endeavors. It also highlights the theme of faith and obedience, as Barak's condition reveals a hesitancy to act without assurance of God's presence. This can be compared to Moses' reluctance to lead without God's assurance in <a href="/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15</a>. Barak's request may also foreshadow the New Testament principle of seeking God's kingdom and righteousness first, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barak.htm">Barak</a></b><br>A military leader of Israel from the tribe of Naphtali, called by God through the prophetess Deborah to lead an army against the Canaanite king Jabin and his commander Sisera.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel, who provided spiritual and military leadership.

When she summons Barak with God&#8217;s marching orders (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6-7</a>), Barak responds personally and directly to her.<p>&#8226; By addressing Deborah instead of negotiating with other military leaders, Barak shows he accepts her God-given authority. Similar recognition of prophetic leadership is seen when Israel comes to Samuel for direction (<a href="/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a> later places Barak among the heroes of faith, confirming that Scripture itself views this dialogue as part of a genuine, God-honoring trust relationship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If you will go with me</b><p>Barak anchors his obedience to the prophetess&#8217;s presence.<p>&#8226; Like Moses pleading, &#8220;If Your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15</a>), Barak knows victory depends on God&#8217;s guidance&#8212;and Deborah embodies that guidance.<p>&#8226; For Israel, a prophet going into battle was normal (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-2.htm">Deuteronomy 20:2-4</a>), signaling to the troops that the LORD Himself marched ahead. Barak&#8217;s request therefore echoes covenant practice, not cowardice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will go</b><p>Barak&#8217;s willingness is immediate once Deborah agrees.<p>&#8226; This quick yes mirrors how later he will &#8220;rout Sisera&#8221; once Deborah declares, &#8220;Up, for this is the day the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand&#8221; (<a href="/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; True faith is responsive: &#8220;With my God I can scale a wall&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-29.htm">Psalm 18:29</a>). Barak is poised to act, provided the visible token of God&#8217;s word&#8212;the prophetess&#8212;accompanies him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but if you will not go with me</b><p>Here we glimpse the tension between faith and fear.<p>&#8226; Barak hesitates to move without God&#8217;s representative, much like Gideon needed the fleece (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>) or was allowed to take his servant if afraid (<a href="/judges/7-10.htm">Judges 7:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Deborah does not rebuke him for sin but states the consequence: &#8220;the honor will not be yours, for the LORD will deliver Sisera into the hand of a woman&#8221; (<a href="/judges/4-9.htm">Judges 4:9</a>). The text affirms that God still works through imperfect yet obedient servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will not go</b><p>This line fixes the condition.<p>&#8226; Barak will forfeit earthly glory rather than fight without the assurance of God&#8217;s presence. His stance underscores that victory belongs to the LORD, not to human strategy (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately God honors the heart that clings to Him; Barak&#8217;s name stands in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a> alongside Gideon, Samson, and David, while Sisera&#8217;s defeat through Jael fulfills Deborah&#8217;s prophecy (<a href="/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/4-8.htm">Judges 4:8</a> shows a commander who refuses to march unless the LORD&#8217;s prophetess goes with him. Barak&#8217;s words reveal respect for God-appointed authority, dependence on divine presence, and a willingness to trade personal glory for assured guidance. Scripture records his response not to shame him but to illustrate how the LORD accomplishes His purposes through those who trust His word, even when that trust is mingled with human weakness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">If thou wilt go with me.</span>--The enterprise seemed so daring and so hopeless, that if not for his own sake, yet for the sake of his army, Barak felt how much would be gained by the presence of the inspired prophetess. The LXX. has the remarkable addition, "Because I know not the day in which the Lord prospers the angel with me." This is a sort of excuse for his want of perfect faith. He depends on Deborah to give him the immediate augury of victory. "In the Messenian war the soldiers fought bravely because their seers were present" (Pausan. iv. 16--Cassel).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Barak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;r&#257;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1301.htm">Strong's 1301: </a> </span><span class="str2">Barak -- 'flash of lightning', an Israelite leader</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
