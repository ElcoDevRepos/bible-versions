The number 18,000 indicates a substantial portion of the Benjamite fighting force, reflecting the severity of the conflict. This event is part of a larger narrative where the tribe of Benjamin is nearly annihilated due to their defense of the men of Gibeah, who committed a grievous crime. The fall of these men signifies the judgment upon Benjamin for their actions and the consequences of internal strife within Israel. This also serves as a reminder of the destructive nature of sin and disobedience to God's laws.<p><b>all men of valor</b><br>The term "men of valor" refers to the warriors' bravery and skill in battle. Despite their courage and strength, they were unable to withstand the judgment that came upon them. This phrase underscores the futility of relying solely on human strength and valor when opposed to divine justice. It also reflects the tragic loss of potential and leadership within the tribe of Benjamin, as these men represented the best of their warriors. The concept of "men of valor" is echoed throughout Scripture, often used to describe those who are mighty in battle, such as David's mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-39</a>). This highlights the importance of aligning one's strength with God's purposes rather than opposing them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_benjamin.htm">The Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for their fierce warriors.
