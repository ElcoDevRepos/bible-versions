In the context of Judges, the "princes" refers to the tribal leaders or judges who were responsible for guiding the people according to God's laws. The period of the Judges was marked by a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. Leadership was crucial in rallying the people to return to God and fight against their oppressors. This leadership is seen as divinely appointed, as God raised up judges to deliver Israel (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>). The role of these leaders can be compared to the role of Christ as the ultimate leader and deliverer of His people.<p><b>when the people volunteer</b><br>The voluntary participation of the people signifies a collective willingness to follow God's direction and support their leaders. This reflects a communal commitment to God's covenant, reminiscent of the unity seen in the early church (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>). The willingness of the people to volunteer is crucial for the success of any divine mission, as seen in the battles led by figures like Moses, Joshua, and later, King David. This phrase underscores the importance of unity and cooperation among God's people, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture.<p><b>bless the LORD</b><br>The call to "bless the LORD" is an exhortation to praise and thank God for His guidance and deliverance. In the context of <a href="/judges/5.htm">Judges 5</a>, this is part of the Song of Deborah, a victory hymn celebrating God's intervention in delivering Israel from the Canaanite king Jabin and his commander Sisera. Blessing the LORD is a response to His faithfulness and mighty acts, a theme echoed throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103:1-2</a>). This phrase also points to the ultimate purpose of all creation, which is to glorify God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel who, along with Barak, led Israel to victory over the Canaanite army.
