This act of setting up a graven image directly violates the second commandment given in <a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>, which prohibits the making and worshiping of idols. The narrative reflects the spiritual decline and syncretism prevalent in Israel during the time of the Judges, where people did what was right in their own eyes (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>). The use of Micah's idol signifies a departure from true worship of Yahweh, illustrating the ease with which the Israelites adopted pagan practices.<p><b>and it was there the whole time</b><br>This indicates the duration of the idolatrous practice, suggesting a long-term deviation from the worship of the true God. The persistence of the idol in Dan's religious life underscores the entrenched nature of idolatry in Israel during this period. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the difficulty of returning to true worship once false practices are established. This period of idolatry lasted until the time of Samuel, who began to lead Israel back to the worship of Yahweh (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-4</a>).<p><b>the house of God was in Shiloh</b><br>Shiloh was the religious center of Israel before the establishment of the temple in Jerusalem. It was where the Tabernacle, the dwelling place of God's presence, was located (<a href="/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>). The contrast between the legitimate worship at Shiloh and the idolatrous practices in Dan highlights the spiritual disunity and fragmentation within Israel. Shiloh's significance is further emphasized in <a href="/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1-3</a>, where it is the setting for the early life of Samuel. The presence of the house of God in Shiloh during this time serves as a backdrop to the narrative, illustrating the tension between true worship and the pervasive idolatry in the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>An Ephraimite who created a shrine with a graven image and hired a Levite to be his priest, which was contrary to God's commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/danites.htm">Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel that sought territory for themselves and took Micah's idol and priest, setting up the idol in their new city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/graven_image.htm">Graven Image</a></b><br>An idol made by Micah, representing a direct violation of the second commandment against idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_god_in_shiloh.htm">House of God in Shiloh</a></b><br>The central place of worship for Israel at the time, where the tabernacle was located, signifying the proper place for worship and sacrifice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>A significant religious center in Israel where the tabernacle was located, representing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual blindness and separation from God.
