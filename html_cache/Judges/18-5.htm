The context is the period of the Judges, a time characterized by a lack of centralized leadership in Israel, leading to moral and spiritual chaos. The Danites were seeking new territory because they had not yet secured their inheritance (<a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>). This reflects the broader theme of Israel's incomplete conquest of Canaan.<p><b>&#8220;Please inquire of God</b><br>The Danites approach a Levite priest, who is serving in the house of Micah, to seek divine guidance. This reflects the practice of seeking God's will through a priest, which was common in Israelite culture. The use of a Levite, despite his questionable association with Micah's idolatrous shrine, indicates a desire for divine approval, albeit through compromised means. This highlights the syncretism and religious confusion prevalent during the time of the Judges.<p><b>to determine whether we will have a successful journey.&#8221;</b><br>The request for a successful journey underscores the Danites' concern for divine favor in their quest for a new homeland. This reflects the biblical principle that success is ultimately dependent on God's blessing (<a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>). The Danites' journey can be seen as a microcosm of Israel's larger journey to secure the Promised Land, drawing parallels to the Israelites' reliance on God's guidance during the Exodus and conquest of Canaan. However, their reliance on a compromised religious system foreshadows the spiritual failures that would lead to their eventual downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel seeking a new territory because they had not yet received their inheritance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>An Ephraimite who had set up a shrine with an idol and appointed his own priest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A young Levite who became a priest for Micah and was later approached by the Danites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/laish.htm">Laish</a></b><br>The city the Danites were scouting to conquer and settle in.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>The Danites' expedition to find a new land for their tribe.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_guidance.htm">Seeking God's Guidance</a></b><br>The importance of seeking God's will before making significant decisions is emphasized.
