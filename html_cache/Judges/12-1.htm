Their assembly and crossing of the Jordan indicate a significant mobilization, suggesting a strong sense of grievance or entitlement. Zaphon, likely located in the territory of Gad, was a strategic location for crossing the Jordan River. This movement reflects the tribal tensions and rivalries that were common in the period of the Judges, as tribes often acted independently and sometimes in conflict with one another.<p><b>They said to Jephthah,</b><br>Jephthah was a judge of Israel, known for his leadership and military prowess. His background as the son of a harlot and his initial rejection by his family highlight themes of redemption and God's use of unlikely individuals for His purposes. The Ephraimites' approach to Jephthah underscores their dissatisfaction and the expectation of being included in military campaigns, reflecting their desire for honor and spoils of war.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you crossed over to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you?</b><br>The Ammonites were a perennial enemy of Israel, often oppressing them. Jephthah's campaign against them was a significant military victory. The Ephraimites' question reveals their anger at being excluded from the battle, which they perceived as a slight against their honor and a missed opportunity for plunder. This reflects the tribal dynamics of the time, where alliances and participation in battles were crucial for maintaining status and influence.<p><b>We will burn your house down with you inside!&#8221;</b><br>This threat of violence indicates the severity of the Ephraimites' anger and the potential for civil conflict within Israel. Such internal strife was not uncommon during the time of the Judges, a period marked by a lack of centralized leadership and frequent cycles of sin, oppression, and deliverance. The threat also highlights the volatile nature of tribal relationships and the lengths to which tribes would go to assert their grievances. This internal discord contrasts with the unity and peace that God desired for His people, as seen in other parts of Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_ephraim.htm">Men of Ephraim</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel known for their strength and pride.

The Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">Tsaphonah, </span>rendered <span class= "ital">Sephenia </span>in some MSS. of the LXX. (Cod. A., <span class= "ital">Kephenia</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Hence some suppose that it means "towards Tsaphon," a town in the Jordan valley not far from Succoth, which the Jews identified with Amathus (<a href="/joshua/13-27.htm" title="And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.">Joshua 13:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And didst not call us.</span>--The tribe of Ephraim throughout the Book of Judges is represented in a most unenviable light--slothful and acquiescent in time of oppression, and turbulently arrogant when others have taken the initiative and won the victory (<a href="/context/joshua/17-14.htm" title="And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, for as much as the LORD has blessed me till now?">Joshua 17:14-18</a>; <a href="/judges/8-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.">Judges 8:1</a>). They brought on their own heads the terrible disgrace and humiliation which Jephthah inflicted on them. They resembled Sparta in dilatoriness, and perhaps in courage; but when Athens had won Marathon, Sparta had at least the generosity to congratulate her (Herod. v. 20). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Northward</span>, or, otherwise rendered, to <span class="accented">Zaphon</span>, a city of the Gadites mentioned in <a href="/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> together with Succoth, and thought to be <span class="accented">the modern</span>, <span class="accented">Amateh</span> on the Wady Rajlb (see Vanderveld's map). It is difficult to say with certainty which rendering is right, but on the whole the latter seems most probable. Although Gilead does lie north-east of Ephraim, it hardly seems a natural description of the Ephraimite movement to say they "went northwards;" whereas if they marched to Zaphon the phrase would be precise. The previous phrase, <span class="cmt_word">gathered themselves together</span>, means <span class="accented">mustered for battle</span>, as in <a href="/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23, 24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">We will burn thine house</span>, etc. - the same savage threat as the Philistine youths made use of to induce Samson's wife to discover and reveal his riddle (<a href="/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>), and as the Philistines actually put in practice upon her and her father in revenge for the destruction of their corn (<a href="/judges/15-6.htm">Judges 15:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Passedst thou over</span>, as in <a href="/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29, 32</a>;
