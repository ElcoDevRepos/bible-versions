Gilgal is significant as the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). It was a place of covenant renewal and circumcision (<a href="/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2-9</a>), symbolizing Israel's commitment to God. The presence of idols here highlights the spiritual decline and syncretism that had infiltrated Israelite society.<p><b>he himself turned back</b><br>Ehud's decision to turn back suggests a deliberate and strategic plan. This action demonstrates his courage and cunning, as he risks returning to the enemy's presence. It reflects the biblical theme of God using unexpected means and people to deliver His people, as seen with other judges like Gideon and Deborah.<p><b>and said, &#8220;I have a secret message for you, O king.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "secret message" implies a sense of urgency and importance. In the ancient Near East, secret messages were often associated with divine or prophetic revelations. Ehud's approach to the king under the guise of delivering a confidential message shows his shrewdness and ability to exploit the king's curiosity and desire for exclusive knowledge.<p><b>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; said the king,</b><br>The king's command for silence indicates his interest and willingness to hear the message privately. This reflects the cultural practice of kings valuing secret counsel and the potential for divine communication. It also sets the stage for Ehud's plan to isolate the king, making it easier to carry out his mission.<p><b>and all his attendants left him.</b><br>The departure of the attendants signifies the king's trust in Ehud and his expectation of receiving a significant message. This moment of isolation is crucial for Ehud's plan to succeed. It highlights the vulnerability of the king and the providential circumstances that allow Ehud to act.

He wished (1) to secure his end, which would be more difficult amid the soldiers and attendants who would guard the king during the presentation of the tribute; (2) to avoid endangering his comrades; (3) to provide, if possible, for his own escape. By going away with the deputation of serfs<p>which he had introduced, he would still more lull suspicion asleep.<p><span class= "bld">From the quarries.</span>--The Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">pesilim. </span>The LXX., followed by our margin, render it "graven images;" and the Vulgate, "from Gilgal, where were idols." (Luther, <span class= "ital">G&#8221;tzen.</span>) Such is the meaning of <span class= "ital">pesilim </span>in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-41.htm" title="So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day.">2Kings 17:41</a>; <a href="/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a>, &c. The rendering, <span class= "ital">"</span>stone quarries," is derived from the Chaldee and Rabbi Jarchi; but it probably means idols of some kind--probably those of Moab. Some explain it of the twelve stones which were taken out of Jordan, and pitched at Gilgal (<a href="/joshua/4-2.htm" title="Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,">Joshua 4:2</a>). The LXX. (in some MSS.) make it mean that <span class= "ital">Eglon </span>returned, but this is clearly a mistake. Gilgal was near Jericho, and when Ehud had accompanied his comrades to some well-known landmark at Gilgal, he returned to Jericho. Josephus says he had "two attendants" with him; but the word "people" in <a href="/judges/3-18.htm" title="And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.">Judges 3:18</a> implies that many more had accompanied him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The quarries</span>.
