The "angel of the LORD" is often understood as a theophany, a manifestation of God Himself, rather than a mere angelic being. This encounter is similar to those experienced by other biblical figures such as Abraham (Genesis 18) and Moses (Exodus 3). The recognition of the divine presence signifies a shift from doubt to faith, as Gideon understands the gravity of his mission and the divine support behind it.<p><b>he said, &#8220;Oh no, Lord GOD!</b><br>Gideon's exclamation reflects a common biblical reaction to encountering the divine, characterized by fear and awe. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) emphasizes the sovereignty and holiness of God. This response is reminiscent of Isaiah's reaction in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, where he expresses a sense of unworthiness in the presence of God. It underscores the human recognition of God's majesty and the fear of judgment.<p><b>I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!&#8221;</b><br>Seeing God "face to face" was believed to be a perilous experience, as expressed in <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>, where God tells Moses that no one can see His face and live. Gideon's fear is rooted in this understanding, highlighting the seriousness of his encounter. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God through Jesus Christ, who is described as the image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). Gideon's experience prefigures the ultimate revelation of God in Christ, who bridges the gap between the divine and human.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Gideon suddenly grasps his unworthiness before holy Majesty, echoing Isaiah&#8217;s cry, &#8220;Woe to me! &#8230; my eyes have seen the King&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling Him &#8220;Lord GOD&#8221; (Adonai Yahweh) signals submission; Gideon bows to sovereign authority much like David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18</a>.<p>&#8226; Reverent fear is a right response when sinful humanity recognizes direct contact with a holy God (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!</b><p>&#8226; Gideon recalls the warning, &#8220;You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). Believing he has looked upon deity, he expects judgment.<p>&#8226; Yet the very next verse brings assurance: &#8220;Peace be with you; do not be afraid, for you will not die&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-23.htm">Judges 6:23</a>). Grace triumphs over fear, foreshadowing the saving peace believers receive through Christ (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Other patriarchs survived similar encounters&#8212;Jacob in <a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a> named the place Peniel, &#8220;for I have seen God face to face&#8221;&#8212;showing that God mercifully bridges the gap between His holiness and our frailty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22</a> captures the pivotal moment when Gideon moves from skepticism to awe. Realizing the divine identity of the Visitor, he responds with reverent fear, confessing his unworthiness and expecting death. God, however, answers that fear with peace, revealing His character: holy yet gracious, awesome yet approachable. The verse invites believers to recognize God&#8217;s presence, revere His holiness, and rest in His mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">When Gideon perceived.</span>--The last sign gave him a deeper sense than before of the grandeur of the messenger who had come to him.<p><span class= "bld">Alas !</span>--There is no need to supply "I shall die" at the end of the clause, but that this was the apprehension in Gideon's mind is shown by his cry of alarm.<p><span class= "bld">For because.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">for to this end. </span>The belief that death or misfortune would be the result of looking on any Divine being was universal among the Jews.
