His presence in this narrative highlights the moral and spiritual decline in Israel during the time of the Judges. The term "husband" here is notable because it reflects the cultural practice of concubinage, where a concubine had a recognized but lesser status than a wife. This situation underscores the complex social and familial structures of ancient Israel. The Levite's response is part of a larger assembly of the tribes of Israel, indicating the gravity of the situation and the communal approach to justice.<p><b>I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.</b><br>Gibeah, a town in the territory of Benjamin, becomes infamous due to the events that unfold. This location is significant as it later becomes the royal city of King Saul, Israel's first king. The mention of spending the night suggests the cultural expectation of hospitality, which was a sacred duty in ancient Near Eastern societies. The failure of the people of Gibeah to provide this hospitality, leading to the tragic events, highlights the moral decay and lawlessness prevalent during this period, as described in <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>, "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes." This phrase also foreshadows the violence and chaos that will ensue, serving as a microcosm of the broader spiritual and social disorder in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties.

His role heightens the gravity of the events; a Levite should have been a model of covenant faithfulness, yet he is caught in the moral collapse of Israel (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; 21:25).<p>&#8226; The narrative reminds us that even those in spiritual service are affected when society abandons God&#8217;s standards (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the husband of the murdered woman</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Her death is not an abstract crime but a personal violation of marital trust and God-given dignity (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>).<p>&#8226;

His answer becomes the legal basis for Israel&#8217;s action against Benjamin, illustrating corporate responsibility for justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-1.htm">Deuteronomy 21:1&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226;
