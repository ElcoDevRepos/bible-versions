The city square was a common gathering place in ancient cities, often used for social interaction and commerce. It was customary for travelers to wait there for someone to offer them hospitality, as inns were rare. This setting highlights the cultural expectation of hospitality in ancient Israel, a theme that is central to this story. The traveler, a Levite, represents a figure who should have been readily welcomed, reflecting the moral decline in Israel during the time of the Judges.<p><b>the old man asked</b><br>The old man is depicted as a resident of Gibeah, a city within the territory of Benjamin. His inquiry reflects the cultural norm of offering hospitality to strangers, a practice deeply rooted in the traditions of the Near East. The old man's willingness to engage with the traveler contrasts with the indifference of the other inhabitants of Gibeah, underscoring the breakdown of social and moral order in Israel. This encounter foreshadows the tragic events that follow, highlighting the theme of hospitality&#8212;or the lack thereof&#8212;as a measure of righteousness.<p><b>&#8220;Where are you going, and where have you come from?&#8221;</b><br>These questions are typical of ancient Near Eastern hospitality customs, serving both as a polite inquiry and a means to assess the needs of the traveler. The questions also serve to introduce the Levite's journey, which is a critical element of the narrative. The Levite's response reveals his background and the purpose of his journey, setting the stage for the unfolding events. This interaction can be seen as a reflection of the broader spiritual journey of Israel, as the nation grapples with its identity and relationship with God during the time of the Judges. The questions also echo the biblical theme of pilgrimage and sojourning, reminding readers of the transient nature of life and the ultimate journey towards God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_traveler.htm">The Traveler (Levite)</a></b><br>A Levite who is journeying with his concubine and servant, seeking lodging in the city of Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_man.htm">The Old Man</a></b><br>An inhabitant of Gibeah who offers hospitality to the traveler, showing concern for his welfare.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin, known for its inhospitable and later, immoral behavior as the account unfolds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_square.htm">The City Square</a></b><br>The public area where travelers would wait for someone to offer them lodging, highlighting the cultural expectation of hospitality.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>The Levite's journey is a central event, setting the stage for the subsequent tragic events in Gibeah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_hospitality.htm">The Importance of Hospitality</a></b><br>Hospitality is a recurring biblical theme, reflecting God's love and care for all people.
