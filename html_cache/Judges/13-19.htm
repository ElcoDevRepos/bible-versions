The young goat, or "kid," was a common sacrificial animal, symbolizing atonement and dedication. The grain offering, often made of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, represented the fruits of human labor and thanksgiving. This combination of offerings reflects a holistic approach to worship, involving both animal sacrifice and the produce of the land, indicating a complete dedication to God.<p><b>and offered them on a rock to the LORD.</b><br>The use of a rock as an altar is significant, as it suggests a natural, unhewn place of sacrifice, which aligns with the instructions given in <a href="/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a> about building altars. This act of offering on a rock signifies purity and simplicity in worship, free from human alteration. Offering to the LORD indicates a direct act of worship and submission to Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel, who is distinct from the pagan deities of the surrounding nations.<p><b>And as Manoah and his wife looked on,</b><br>The presence of Manoah and his wife as witnesses to the offering underscores the communal aspect of worship and the importance of family in spiritual practices. Their observation of the event highlights their active participation and anticipation of God's response. This moment also emphasizes the role of both husband and wife in the spiritual life of the family, reflecting the biblical theme of partnership in faith.<p><b>the LORD did a marvelous thing.</b><br>The "marvelous thing" refers to a miraculous event, often seen as a divine confirmation of God's presence and approval. In the broader biblical narrative, such acts are signs of God's power and involvement in human affairs, often serving as a precursor to significant events or revelations. This phrase connects to other instances in Scripture where God performs wonders, such as the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> or the fire from heaven in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>, symbolizing divine intervention and the fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>The father of Samson, Manoah is a Danite who seeks to understand the divine message regarding the birth of his son.
