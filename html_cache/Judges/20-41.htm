The Israelites, after initially retreating, turned back to confront the Benjamites. This tactic is reminiscent of Joshua's strategy at Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-18.htm">Joshua 8:18-21</a>), where a feigned retreat led to a decisive victory. The turning back signifies a shift in momentum, suggesting divine intervention and fulfillment of God's promise to deliver the Benjamites into Israel's hands (<a href="/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>).<p><b>and the men of Benjamin were terrified</b><br>The terror of the Benjamites reflects a sudden realization of their vulnerable position. This fear can be compared to the fear that fell upon the Canaanites when they faced the Israelites (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). It underscores the psychological impact of warfare and the divine judgment upon Benjamin for their sin (<a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22-30</a>). The fear also fulfills the biblical principle that those who oppose God's people will ultimately face fear and defeat (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>).<p><b>when they realized that disaster had come upon them</b><br>The disaster refers to the overwhelming defeat and destruction that the Benjamites faced. This realization is a moment of reckoning, akin to the judgment that fell upon Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>). It serves as a warning of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God's commandments. The disaster also foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will come upon all who oppose God's will, as seen in prophetic scriptures like <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who were engaged in a civil war against the tribe of Benjamin due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_benjamin.htm">Men of Benjamin</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, who were defending themselves against the other tribes of Israel.

Just as Joshua&#8217;s forces turned back on Ai when the signal was given (<a href="/joshua/8-18.htm">Joshua 8:18-22</a>), Israel here moves in confident obedience to the LORD&#8217;s plan (<a href="/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28, 36</a>-38).<p>- Spiritually, the phrase reminds us that victory belongs to those who wait for God&#8217;s instruction, not to those who rush ahead in self-reliance (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the men of Benjamin were terrified</b><p>- The Benjaminites had begun the day self-assured, &#8220;striking down about thirty men&#8221; (<a href="/judges/20-39.htm">Judges 20:39</a>), but sudden reversal shattered their courage.<p>- Terror in Scripture often signals the moment when God&#8217;s judgment becomes unmistakable (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15</a>). Here it exposes the futility of fighting against the community of God&#8217;s people when that community finally aligns with His will.<p>- Fear also fulfills the warning that unrepentant sin eventually breeds dread (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>). Benjamin had defended gross wickedness in Gibeah; now their hearts melt when righteousness confronts them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when they realized that disaster had come upon them</b><p>- &#8220;Disaster&#8221; (or &#8220;evil&#8221; in some translations) is not random misfortune; it is the just consequence of persistent rebellion (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p>- The realization echoes Pharaoh&#8217;s moment of awakening at the Red Sea&#8212;too late to escape the LORD&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a>). Benjamin sees the city burning behind them (<a href="/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>) and the Israelite army closing in front; every escape route is sealed.<p>- God&#8217;s holiness demands that sin be confronted, whether in pagan nations or within Israel itself (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a>). Benjamin&#8217;s disaster underscores that belonging to the covenant people does not grant immunity from discipline (<a href="/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-41.htm">Judges 20:41</a> captures the pivot in a tragic civil war: Israel, now acting under God&#8217;s direction, reverses course and attacks; Benjamin, once confident, is seized by terror; and the tribe suddenly understands that divine judgment for tolerated sin has overtaken them. The verse reminds us that obedience brings decisive victory, unchecked sin leads to inevitable disaster, and God&#8217;s righteousness prevails even when His people must confront their own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">And when the men of Israel turned again.</span>--Another detail of the rally described in <a href="/judges/20-33.htm" title="And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.">Judges 20:33</a>, and its effect (<a href="/judges/20-34.htm" title="And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.">Judges 20:34</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
