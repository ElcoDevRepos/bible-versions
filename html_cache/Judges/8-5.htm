Succoth was part of the tribal territory of Gad, one of the tribes of Israel. This interaction highlights the internal divisions within Israel during the time of the Judges, as the tribes were not always united in their efforts against common enemies. The request Gideon makes is significant because it tests the loyalty and support of fellow Israelites in a time of need.<p><b>&#8220;Please give my troops some bread,</b><br>Gideon's request for bread underscores the practical needs of his army. In the ancient Near East, providing food for troops was a common expectation, especially among allies. Bread, a staple food, symbolizes sustenance and support. This request also reflects the broader biblical theme of hospitality and provision, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>, where David requests provisions from Nabal.<p><b>for they are exhausted,</b><br>The exhaustion of Gideon's troops is a testament to their relentless pursuit of the Midianite kings. This phrase highlights the physical demands of warfare and the perseverance required to achieve victory. It also serves as a reminder of the human limitations faced by even the most faithful servants of God, echoing themes found in <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, where strength is renewed by the Lord.<p><b>and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna,</b><br>Zebah and Zalmunna were kings of Midian, a nomadic people who oppressed Israel. Gideon's pursuit of these kings is part of his divinely appointed mission to deliver Israel from Midianite oppression. This pursuit reflects the biblical theme of God's deliverance through chosen leaders, paralleling the pursuit of justice and righteousness seen throughout scripture, such as in the life of King David.<p><b>the kings of Midian.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of the Midianite kings emphasizes the scale and significance of Gideon's mission. The Midianites were a formidable enemy, and their defeat was crucial for Israel's peace and security. This phrase connects to the broader narrative of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to protect and deliver His people, as seen in the covenantal promises to Abraham and his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

It was situated in the tribe of Gad, and is probably the <span class= "ital">Sukkot </span>mentioned by Burckhardt as on the east of Jordan, south wards from Bethshean. The "valley of Succoth" is mentioned in <a href="/psalms/60-6.htm" title="God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.">Psalm 60:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/108-7.htm" title="God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.">Psalm 108:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Loaves of bread.</span>--The loaves are round cakes (<span class= "ital">ciccar</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>His request was a very modest and considerate one. He did not "requisition" them for forces, or for intelligence, or for any active assistance, because he might bear in mind that they on the east of Jordan would, in case of any reverse or incomplete victory, be the first to feel the vengeance of the neighbouring-Midianites. But to supply bread to their own hungry countrymen, who were fighting their battles, was an act of common humanity which even the Midianites could not greatly resent.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the people that follow me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">which is at my feet, </span>as in <a href="/judges/4-10.htm" title="And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.">Judges 4:10</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Succoth</span>. On the east side of Jordan, as appears plainly from the narrative in <a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17, 18</a>; for we read there that Jacob journeyed from Mount Gilead to Mahanaim, thence to Penuel, and from Pe-nuel to Succoth, so called from the <span class="accented">booths</span> or tabernacles which he made for his cattle; and that after leaving Succoth he came to the city of Shechem (called Shalem)," in the land of Canaan," showing that Succoth was not in the land of Canaan. In <a href="/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> we are also distinctly told that Succoth was in the trans-Jordanic tribe of Gad (which lay south of the Jabbok), in the valley of the Jordan, where its proximity to <span class="accented">Mahanaim</span> (vers. 26, 30) shows it to be the same place as Jacob's <span class="accented">Succoth</span>, which was also near the Jabbok (<a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>). The identification of Succoth with any modern representative is very uncertain. Jerome mentions a trans-Jordanic place named Soc-<span class="accented">hoth</span>, in the region of Beth-shan, or Scythe-polls; and Burkhardt also mentions a place described by him as "the ruins of Sukkot," two hours from Bysan (Beth-shan), and on the east of Jordan. But this, as well as the <span class="accented">Sakut</span> of Robinson and Van de Velde, on the west of Jordan, about ten miles south of Beth-shan, is too far north for the Suceoth of Jacob, which is shown to be the same as the Succoth of Gideon by the connection of the latter with Penuel (ver. 8), and which, as above noticed, is shown to be the same as the Succoth of <a href="/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13</a>. by its proximity to Mahanaim. We must await some further light before we can decide the exact position of Succoth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [Gideon] said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
