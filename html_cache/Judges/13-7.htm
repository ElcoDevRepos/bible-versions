In biblical narratives, such encounters are significant, marking divine intervention or the announcement of a special purpose. The angelic visitation underscores the importance of the message and the child to be born.<p><b>&#8216;Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son.</b><br>This announcement of a miraculous birth is a recurring theme in Scripture, often signaling the birth of a significant figure in God's plan. Similar announcements are seen with Isaac (<a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>), John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>), and Jesus (<a href="/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>). The promise of a son to a previously barren woman highlights God's power and sovereignty in fulfilling His purposes.<p><b>Now, therefore, do not drink wine or strong drink,</b><br>The instruction to abstain from wine or strong drink is part of the Nazirite vow, a special consecration to God described in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>. This vow included abstaining from alcohol, not cutting one's hair, and avoiding contact with the dead. The abstention from wine symbolizes purity and separation from worldly pleasures, emphasizing dedication to God.<p><b>and do not eat anything unclean,</b><br>This command aligns with the dietary laws given to Israel in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, which distinguished clean and unclean foods. Observing these laws was a sign of obedience and holiness, setting the Israelites apart from other nations. For the mother of a Nazirite, this requirement underscores the child's consecration even before birth.<p><b>because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb</b><br>Samson's Nazirite status from the womb is unique, as most Nazirites took the vow voluntarily and temporarily. This lifelong consecration indicates a special divine purpose for Samson, setting him apart for God's service. It prefigures the concept of being set apart for God's work, as seen in the lives of prophets and ultimately in Jesus Christ, who was consecrated for His redemptive mission.<p><b>until the day of his death.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The lifelong nature of Samson's Nazirite vow is significant, as it implies a continuous dedication to God. However, Samson's life, as recorded in Judges, shows a struggle with this commitment, reflecting the tension between divine calling and human weakness. This foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of perfect dedication in Jesus Christ, who lived a sinless life and fulfilled His mission completely.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who delivers God's message to Manoah's wife, foretelling the birth of Samson and his Nazirite vow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah's_wife.htm">Manoah's Wife</a></b><br>The unnamed woman who receives the prophecy about her son, Samson.

Since Samuel was also a Nazarite, we see that the distress of the people had led mothers to meditate on the old law of life-dedication to God. In Samson's case this vow was imposed on him from his birth, perhaps to teach the Israelites a moral lesson. Other Nazarites were John the Baptist and James, the Lord's brother. It is not impossible that Joseph was a Nazarite, for in <a href="/genesis/49-26.htm" title="The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brothers.">Genesis 49:26</a> this word is used, though in the English Version it is rendered "separated" from his brethren.
