Resistance was expected (<a href="/exodus/23-29.htm">Exodus 23:29-30</a>), yet divine power had already toppled Jericho and Hazor; the issue here is not God&#8217;s inability but Israel&#8217;s unwillingness (<a href="/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>).<p>&#8226; Determined Canaanites test Israel&#8217;s faith; steadfast obedience would have seen victory (<a href="/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10-12</a>, Caleb&#8217;s example).<p>&#8226; Spiritual parallel: entrenched sin patterns remain &#8220;determined&#8221; until believers, relying on the Spirit, decisively remove them (<a href="/romans/6-11.htm">Romans 6:11-13</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a> records Manasseh&#8217;s choice to tolerate what God had commanded to expel. Strategic cities were left in enemy hands because Israel shrank back when faced with determined opposition. The verse warns that partial obedience undermines future blessing, invites ongoing conflict, and compromises testimony. Victory is available, but only when God&#8217;s people fully trust His promises and act in complete obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Neither did Manasseh.</span>--The sacred historian is glancing at the conquest of Canaan, advancing from the southern tribes upwards to central and northern Palestine.
