Morning, especially at sunrise, is often associated with new beginnings and divine intervention in the Bible. This timing could symbolize the dawning of God's justice. In biblical narratives, morning is a time when God often acts decisively (e.g., <a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>, when the sea returned to its place at morning). The strategic advantage of attacking at sunrise is also practical, as it allows for the element of surprise and the full day ahead for battle.<p><b>get up and advance against the city</b><br>The command to "get up" implies readiness and obedience to divine instruction. The city in question is Shechem, a significant location in Israel's history. It was a city of refuge and a place where covenants were made (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>). The advance against Shechem is not just a military maneuver but a confrontation with a city that has turned away from its covenantal obligations. This phrase also echoes the call to spiritual vigilance and readiness to confront sin and rebellion.<p><b>When Gaal and his men come out against you</b><br>Gaal, son of Ebed, represents opposition to God's chosen leader, Abimelech. His presence in Shechem signifies internal strife and rebellion within Israel. Gaal's challenge to Abimelech is reminiscent of other biblical figures who opposed God's anointed, such as Absalom against David. This internal conflict highlights the recurring theme of Israel's struggle with leadership and fidelity to God.<p><b>do to them whatever you are able</b><br>This phrase underscores the responsibility and agency given to the leader, Zebul, in this context. It reflects the biblical principle of human responsibility in carrying out divine justice. The phrase also suggests a test of faith and capability, as Zebul must rely on his wisdom and strength to execute judgment. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative where God empowers individuals to act according to His will, as seen in the stories of Joshua and David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), who sought to establish himself as king over Shechem by violent means, including the murder of his seventy brothers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gaal_son_of_ebed.htm">Gaal son of Ebed</a></b><br>A man who opposed Abimelech and sought to lead a rebellion against him in Shechem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebul.htm">Zebul</a></b><br>The governor of the city of Shechem, loyal to Abimelech, who secretly informed Abimelech of Gaal's plans and advised him on how to counter the rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>An ancient city in the hill country of Ephraim, significant in Israel's history, where Abimelech sought to consolidate his power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The event where Abimelech, following Zebul's advice, ambushed Gaal and his followers, leading to a decisive conflict.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_ambition_and_pride.htm">The Dangers of Ambition and Pride</a></b><br>Abimelech's account warns against unchecked ambition and pride, which can lead to destructive outcomes.
