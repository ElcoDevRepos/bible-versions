Jephthah was a Gileadite who led Israel to victory over the Ammonites. His story is marked by his vow and the tragic fulfillment involving his daughter. The transition suggests a period of relative peace or stability following Jephthah's leadership, as was common after the judges delivered Israel from oppression.<p><b>Ibzan of Bethlehem</b><br>Ibzan is identified as being from Bethlehem, which is significant as Bethlehem is a town with deep biblical roots. It is the birthplace of King David and later, Jesus Christ, highlighting its importance in biblical history. There are two Bethlehems in Israel: one in Judah and one in Zebulun. The text does not specify which Bethlehem, but traditionally, it is thought to be the one in Judah. This connection to Bethlehem may foreshadow the coming of the ultimate Judge and King, Jesus Christ, who would also come from Bethlehem.<p><b>Judged Israel</b><br>The role of a judge in Israel was not only judicial but also military and spiritual. Judges were raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression and lead them back to covenant faithfulness. Ibzan's judgeship suggests he played a role in maintaining justice and order in Israel during his tenure. The cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance seen throughout the Book of Judges is a reminder of Israel's need for a righteous and eternal judge, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ibzan.htm">Ibzan</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who succeeded Jephthah.
