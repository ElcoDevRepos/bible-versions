The speaker, Gaal, is expressing a wish to lead the people of Shechem, indicating a political ambition that mirrors the instability of Israel during this period. The longing for authority can be seen throughout the Old Testament, where leaders are often raised by God to deliver Israel, such as Moses and Joshua. This desire for leadership contrasts with the biblical ideal of God as the ultimate authority over His people.<p><b>I would remove Abimelech</b><br>Abimelech, the son of Gideon, had declared himself king after the death of his father, despite Gideon's refusal to establish a monarchy. His rule was marked by violence, including the murder of his seventy brothers. Gaal's statement reveals the tension and dissatisfaction with Abimelech's tyrannical rule. This reflects the broader theme in Judges of the consequences of Israel's disobedience and desire for human kingship, which ultimately leads to chaos and suffering. The removal of unjust leaders is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in the stories of Saul and other kings who failed to follow God's commandments.<p><b>I would say to him, &#8216;Muster your army and come out!&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This challenge to Abimelech is a call to battle, reflecting the frequent conflicts and warfare in the period of the Judges. The phrase suggests a direct confrontation, a common method of resolving disputes in ancient times. The call to "muster your army" indicates the reliance on military strength and human power, contrasting with the biblical theme of relying on God's strength and guidance. This challenge can be compared to David's confrontation with Goliath, where faith in God, rather than military might, leads to victory. The phrase also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Abimelech, as his reliance on force and intimidation ultimately leads to his demise, illustrating the biblical principle that pride and tyranny lead to destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gaal_son_of_ebed.htm">Gaal son of Ebed</a></b><br>A man who incites rebellion against Abimelech, expressing a desire to lead the people of Shechem and challenge Abimelech's rule.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (Jerubbaal) who becomes a self-appointed king over Israel, known for his violent rise to power and the murder of his seventy brothers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>A significant city in Israel's history, often associated with covenantal events, but here it becomes a center of political intrigue and rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebul.htm">Zebul</a></b><br>The governor of the city of Shechem, loyal to Abimelech, who plays a role in the unfolding conflict between Gaal and Abimelech.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellion.htm">The Rebellion</a></b><br>The event where Gaal attempts to rally the people of Shechem against Abimelech, highlighting the instability and division within Israel during this period.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_ambition_and_pride.htm">The Dangers of Ambition and Pride</a></b><br>Gaal's desire for power and his boastful challenge to Abimelech serve as a warning against unchecked ambition and pride.

Gaal dreams of authority, plots to depose an unrighteous ruler, voices defiant challenges, and summons battle&#8212;all without seeking the Lord. The verse therefore warns that self-exaltation and boastful confidence invite swift downfall, while reminding us that God remains in control of every throne and every conflict.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Would to God this people were under my hand !</span>--Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/15-4.htm" title="Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!">2Samuel 15:4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And he said to Abimelech.</span>--The "he said" may be the impersonal idiom (comp. <a href="/joshua/7-26.htm" title="And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day.
