This divine messenger's presence signifies God's direct intervention in Israel's affairs. The angel's instructions to Gideon are part of a divine test and revelation, emphasizing the sacred nature of the encounter.<p><b>Take the meat and the unleavened bread</b><br>The offering of meat and unleavened bread is reminiscent of sacrificial practices in Israelite worship, symbolizing sustenance and purity. Unleavened bread, used during Passover, signifies haste and purity, connecting Gideon's actions to Israel's deliverance history. The use of these elements underscores the sacredness of the offering and Gideon's role as a deliverer.<p><b>lay them on this rock</b><br>The rock serves as an altar, a common practice in ancient Israel where natural formations were used for worship. This act of laying the offering on the rock signifies consecration and dedication to God. Rocks as altars are seen throughout the Old Testament, symbolizing God's strength and permanence.<p><b>and pour out the broth</b><br>Pouring out the broth is an act of libation, a form of offering that signifies the complete dedication of the sacrifice to God. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who poured out His life for humanity. The broth, representing life and sustenance, being poured out, prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus.<p><b>And Gideon did so</b><br>Gideon's obedience is crucial, demonstrating his faith and submission to God's will. This act of compliance is a turning point, marking Gideon's transformation from a hesitant individual to a leader chosen by God. His obedience foreshadows the obedience of Christ, who submitted to the Father's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
