Micah's act of ordaining a Levite himself reflects a deviation from the established religious order, highlighting the period's spiritual confusion and the lack of centralized worship. This act underscores the theme of Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The Levite's acceptance of this ordination suggests a decline in adherence to the covenantal laws, as Levites were meant to serve in the tabernacle, not in private homes.<p><b>and the young man became his priest</b><br>The role of a priest was to mediate between God and the people, offering sacrifices and teaching the Law. By appointing the young Levite as his personal priest, Micah was attempting to legitimize his private shrine and idols (<a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>). This action reflects the syncretism and idolatry prevalent in Israel during the time of the Judges. The young man's acceptance of this role indicates a compromise of his Levitical duties, as priests were to serve the entire community, not individual households. This situation foreshadows the later corruption of the priesthood, as seen in the books of Samuel.<p><b>and lived in his house</b><br>The Levite's residence in Micah's house symbolizes the privatization of religious practice, contrary to the communal worship prescribed in the Law. This arrangement suggests a shift from the God-ordained structure of worship centered around the tabernacle to a more personalized, and thus corrupted, form of religion. The Levite's willingness to live with Micah for personal gain (<a href="/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>) reflects the broader moral and spiritual decline of the period. This scenario contrasts with the New Testament depiction of Jesus Christ, who emphasized true worship "in spirit and truth" (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>), pointing to a future where worship would not be confined to specific locations or personal interests.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>An Ephraimite who created a shrine in his home, made an ephod and household gods, and appointed his own son as a priest before finding a Levite to serve in this role.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A young man from Bethlehem in Judah, who was wandering and looking for a place to stay.
