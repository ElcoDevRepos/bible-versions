The term "survivors" indicates those who remained faithful and were preserved by God. The "nobles" could refer to the leaders or rulers of Israel, possibly those who were called to lead the people in battle. This reflects the biblical theme of God using a faithful remnant to achieve His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>.<p><b>the people of the LORD came down to me</b><br>"People of the LORD" signifies the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This phrase emphasizes that the Israelites are not just any people, but those chosen by God. The phrase "came down to me" suggests a gathering or rallying around a leader, in this case, Deborah, who is the speaker in this song. This reflects the unity and divine calling of the Israelites to act under God's guidance, similar to how God called Gideon in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>.<p><b>against the mighty.</b><br>The "mighty" refers to the Canaanite forces led by Sisera, who were oppressing Israel. This phrase highlights the contrast between the seemingly weak and oppressed Israelites and the powerful Canaanite army. It underscores the biblical theme of God empowering the weak to overcome the strong, as seen in David's victory over Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>. This also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over the powers of sin and death, as described in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel who, along with Barak, led Israel to victory over the Canaanite king Jabin and his commander Sisera.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/barak.htm">Barak</a></b><br>The military leader who, under Deborah's guidance, led the Israelite army against Sisera.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_survivors.htm">The Survivors</a></b><br>Refers to the remnant of Israel who survived oppression and came together to fight against their oppressors.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nobles.htm">The Nobles</a></b><br>Likely refers to the leaders or influential figures among the Israelites who played a role in the battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mighty.htm">The Mighty</a></b><br>Represents the Canaanite forces led by Sisera, who were considered powerful and formidable.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_empowers_the_remnant.htm">God Empowers the Remnant</a></b><br>God often uses a faithful remnant to accomplish His purposes.

The MSS. of the LXX. vary, and the Vulgate merely gives a paraphrase. The Alexandrine MS. of the LXX. may be correct: "Then descended a remnant against the mighty." Ewald renders it, "Then descended a remnant of the nobles of the people." They were only "a remnant," because at least six of the tribes--Judah, Simeon, Dan, Asher, Reuben, Gad--held aloof.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord made me have dominion over the mighty.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Jehovah descended to me among the heroes. </span>The LXX.
