This reflects the biblical principle of seeking wisdom and guidance from others, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>, "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed." It also shows a participatory leadership style, which contrasts with the autocratic rule often seen in ancient Near Eastern monarchies.<p><b>and appointed those who would sing to the LORD</b><br>Jehoshaphat's decision to appoint singers highlights the importance of worship in spiritual warfare. The Levites, who were traditionally responsible for temple worship, likely comprised these singers. This act underscores the power of praise and worship as a means of invoking God's presence and favor, as seen in <a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>, which states that God inhabits the praises of His people.<p><b>and praise the splendor of His holiness.</b><br>The focus on God's holiness emphasizes His otherness and purity. Holiness is a central attribute of God, as seen throughout Scripture, including <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the seraphim proclaim, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty." Praising God's holiness acknowledges His supreme authority and sets the tone for divine intervention.<p><b>As they went out before the army,</b><br>The singers leading the army is a strategic and symbolic act, placing worship at the forefront of the battle. This unusual military tactic demonstrates faith in God's power rather than human strength. It echoes the story of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>, where the Israelites marched around the city with priests and trumpets leading the way.<p><b>they were singing: &#8220;Give thanks to the LORD,</b><br>The act of giving thanks in the face of impending battle is an expression of faith and trust in God's deliverance. Thanksgiving is a recurring theme in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>, which repeatedly calls for giving thanks to the LORD for His enduring love.<p><b>for His loving devotion endures forever.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights God's covenant faithfulness, a central theme in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word "hesed," often translated as "loving devotion" or "steadfast love," signifies God's unwavering commitment to His people. This assurance of God's eternal love is echoed in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, which speaks of His mercies being new every morning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the nation in seeking God's guidance and deliverance from their enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing a coalition of enemies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_singers.htm">The Singers</a></b><br>Appointed by Jehoshaphat to lead the army with praise and worship, emphasizing the power of worship in spiritual warfare.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose holiness and enduring love are central to the worship and victory of His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_army.htm">The Army</a></b><br>The military force of Judah, which was led into battle by worship rather than conventional warfare tactics.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_praise.htm">The Power of Praise</a></b><br>Worship is a powerful weapon in spiritual warfare.
