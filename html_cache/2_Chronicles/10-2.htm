His name means "the people will contend," which foreshadows his role in the division of Israel. The context here is the death of Solomon and the ascension of Rehoboam, Solomon's son, to the throne. Jeroboam had previously been told by the prophet Ahijah that he would rule over ten tribes of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). This prophecy sets the stage for the events in <a href="/2_chronicles/10.htm">2 Chronicles 10</a>. Jeroboam's hearing of the situation indicates the spread of news and the political unrest following Solomon's reign.<p><b>he returned from Egypt</b><br>Jeroboam's return from Egypt is significant. He had fled there to escape Solomon's wrath after Ahijah's prophecy (<a href="/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). Egypt, during this period, was a place of refuge for political exiles, as seen with other biblical figures like Moses. Jeroboam's return signifies a shift in political power and the fulfillment of God's word through Ahijah. Egypt's role as a sanctuary highlights the geopolitical dynamics of the ancient Near East, where neighboring nations often played roles in Israel's internal affairs.<p><b>where he had fled from King Solomon</b><br>Jeroboam's flight from Solomon underscores the tension and potential threat he posed to Solomon's kingdom. Solomon, despite his wisdom, faced internal challenges, including the discontent of the northern tribes. Jeroboam's escape to Egypt reflects the broader theme of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His plans despite human opposition. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of exile and return, a recurring theme in Israel's history. Solomon's inability to secure his kingdom against God's declared plan through Ahijah illustrates the limits of human power against divine will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_son_of_nebat.htm">Jeroboam son of Nebat</a></b><br>A significant figure in Israel's history, Jeroboam was an industrious servant of Solomon who later became the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The verse invites confidence that every detail in God&#8217;s plan&#8212;names, rumors, journeys, even forced exiles&#8212;serves His unerring purposes and will unfold exactly as Scripture declares.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Who was in Egypt.</span>--Really a parenthesis, "And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard (now he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the face of Solomon the king), that Jeroboam returned from Egypt." The chronicler has omitted to say he was <span class= "ital">still</span> in Egypt (<span class= "ital">'odenn-,</span> Kings), because he has not alluded before to his flight thither. (See <a href="/context/1_kings/11-26.htm" title="And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.">1Kings 11:26-40</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</span>--Kings continues the parenthesis, "and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt." The words <span class= "ital">dwelt</span> and <span class= "ital">returned</span> are spelt with the same letters in Hebrew, the difference being one of pointing only.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - In these verses the compiler brings up lost time. He has not mentioned before the name of Jeroboam, just as he has not mentioned the lustful sins of Solomon that led to idolatry, and these sequel idolatries of his, that heralded the shattering of his kingdom immediately on his decease. So we are now told all in one how Jeroboam, in his refuge-retreat in Egypt (<a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26-40</a>), "heard" of Solomon's demise, and apparently (see first clause of our third verse) heard of it in this wise, that "they," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "all Israel" (of our first verse) "had sent and called him" Probably the growing sense of discontent and the rankling in those tribes that were not closely breathing the atmosphere of Jerusalem and the one home county, because of their burdens and taxation, and possibly also Ephraim's ancient and famed rivalry, knew instinctively that this hour of Solomon's death was the hour, if any, of their redemption. The <span class="accented">lacunae</span> in the history speak for themselves; for though the tribes, after the long seething of their com-plainings and sufferings, needed but short time for deliberation, Solomon's death must have been an accomplished fact before they (whoever the "they" were) sent to Egypt to Jeroboam; and that sending and his returning or otherwise, at any rate his hearing and consequent returning, must have taken time. Considering all this, it <span class="accented">is re</span>markable that no note of time is found. But had only our first verse been placed as the last of the foregoing chapter, the ambiguity would have been less. For the strange variations on the history of Jeroboam (a name, together with that of Rehoboam, new to Solomon's time, meaning "many-peopled," while Rehoboam signifies "increaser of people"), as found in the Hebrew texts, and additions to it, see the Septuagint Version, <a href="/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-24.htm">1 Kings 12:24</a>; and A. P. Stanley's article, "Jeroboam," in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. 979, 980; and comp. again <a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26-40</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-13.htm">1 Kings 14:13, 17, 18</a>. Stanley's faith in the Septuagint notwithstanding, its variations and additions are not reconcileable enough with either the Hebrew text or themselves to command anything like unfeigned acceptance. One thing may be considered to come out without much obscurity or uncertainty - that Jeroboam was the acknowledged rather than tacit leader of an opposition that was tacit at present rather than acknowledged; nor is it at all improbable, under all the circumstances, that the Rehoboam party <span class="accented">in</span>, knowing well how the ground really lay, were as content to let the coronation, so to call it, at Shechem linger awhile for Jeroboam's return, as Jeroboam's opposition party <span class="accented">out</span> desired and perhaps compelled the delay. Of course, Jeroboam knew well, none better than he, as of old the overseer of the forced labour and taxation of Ephraim (<a href="/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>), how grievous the service and how heavy the yoke to his people, even when he had acquitted himself as the most "industrious" of taskmasters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/10-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Jeroboam</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3379.htm">Strong's 3379: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jeroboam -- 'the people increase', the name of two Israelites kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Nebat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1496;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5028.htm">Strong's 5028: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nebat -- father of Jeroboam</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard about this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1448;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(ki&#353;&#183;m&#333;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
