Gerar, a city located in the Negev region, was historically significant as a Philistine city and a place where Abraham and Isaac had interactions (<a href="/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20:1, 26</a>:1). The pursuit to Gerar indicates a decisive victory, as the enemy was chased far from Judah's borders. This reflects God's favor and the fulfillment of His promise to protect and give victory to those who are faithful (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>).<p><b>The Cushites fell and could not recover,</b><br>The Cushites, likely from the region of modern-day Sudan or Ethiopia, were known for their strength and numbers. Their inability to recover signifies a complete and overwhelming defeat. This mirrors other biblical accounts where God intervenes to ensure the victory of His people, such as the defeat of the Midianites by Gideon (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>). It emphasizes the theme of divine intervention in battles, where human strength is insufficient without God's aid.<p><b>for they were crushed before the LORD and His army.</b><br>The phrase "before the LORD and His army" highlights that the victory was attributed to divine intervention rather than mere military might. This reflects the biblical principle that God fights for His people (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>). The imagery of God leading His army is reminiscent of the Lord as a warrior (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>) and foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over evil (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p><b>So the people of Judah carried off a great amount of plunder.</b><br>The collection of plunder signifies not only a military victory but also a transfer of wealth and resources, which was common in ancient warfare. This act of taking plunder is seen throughout the Old Testament as a sign of God's blessing and provision (<a href="/joshua/8-27.htm">Joshua 8:27</a>). It also serves as a tangible reminder of God's faithfulness and the rewards of obedience, aligning with the covenant blessings promised to Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led his people in a time of religious reform and military victory.

After the LORD routed Zerah&#8217;s vast Cushite force (14:11-12), Asa does not stop at the initial victory; he presses on until the enemy is driven completely from the land.<p>&#8226; Gerar lies on Judah&#8217;s southwestern edge (<a href="/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1</a>), so the pursuit covers many miles&#8212;evidence of God-given stamina similar to the Israelites who &#8220;pursued the Philistines&#8230; as far as the entrance of Gath and Ekron&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-52.htm">1 Samuel 17:52</a>).<p>&#8226; This determined follow-through fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>: &#8220;The LORD will cause the enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you. They will march out against you in one direction but flee before you in seven.&#8221; God&#8217;s promise motivates Asa to keep moving until the threat is neutralized.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Cushites fell and could not recover</b><p>&#8226; Scripture records, &#8220;The Cushites fell and could not recover.&#8221; The verb paints a finality: their military strength is broken beyond repair.<p>&#8226; Earlier, their numbers dwarfed Judah (an army of a million, 14:9). Yet the result mirrors <a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>, where Pharaoh&#8217;s chariots &#8220;went down into the sea, &#8230; not one of them survived.&#8221; When God fights, size is irrelevant (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also anticipates <a href="/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>, where the prophet reminds Asa, &#8220;Were not the Cushites and Libyans a vast army&#8230;? Yet because you relied on the LORD, He delivered them into your hand.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Crushed before the LORD and His army</b><p>&#8226; The Spirit shifts focus from Judah&#8217;s soldiers to the true Captain: &#8220;they were crushed before the LORD and His army.&#8221; Judah&#8217;s troops are called &#8220;His army,&#8221; underscoring that God Himself commands and empowers (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14-15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>&#8226; The outcome is credited directly to divine action. <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a> echoes the same truth: &#8220;It was not by their sword that they took the land&#8230; it was Your hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Asa&#8217;s earlier prayer claimed this promise: &#8220;O LORD&#8230; in Your name we have come against this multitude&#8221; (14:11). The verse confirms that God honored that faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the people of Judah carried off a great amount of plunder</b><p>&#8226; Victory leads to overflow: Judah &#8220;carried off a great amount of plunder.&#8221; The Old Testament repeatedly links obedience and reliance on God with tangible blessing (<a href="/1_samuel/30-18.htm">1 Samuel 30:18-20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-8.htm">2 Kings 7:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The abundance also weakens future threats by stripping the enemy&#8217;s resources (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14-15</a>). This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, &#8220;the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Material gain is never the primary goal, yet it testifies that the LORD &#8220;rewards those who earnestly seek Him&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/14-13.htm">2 Chronicles 14:13</a> shows a complete divine victory: Judah, led by King Asa, chases the Cushite invaders all the way to Gerar, and the once-formidable enemy collapses irreversibly. The verse highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness to fight for His people, crediting Him as the real Commander of Judah&#8217;s army. Because the LORD shatters opposition, His people not only survive but also gather abundant spoil. The passage calls believers to trust, obey, and press on in confidence that the same LORD still secures triumph for those who rely on Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Pursued them unto Gerar.</span>--(<a href="/genesis/20-1.htm" title="And Abraham journeyed from there toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.">Genesis 20:1</a>.) <span class= "ital">Kirbet-el-Gerar,</span> in the Wady Gerar, about eight miles S.S.E. of Gaza, on the route to Egypt (LXX.
