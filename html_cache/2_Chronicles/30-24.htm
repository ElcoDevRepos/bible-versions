His contribution of a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep signifies his commitment to the Passover celebration, which had not been observed on such a scale since the days of Solomon. This act of generosity reflects the king's dedication to God and his desire to lead the nation in repentance and renewal. The large number of animals indicates the scale of the festival and the king's role in facilitating worship for the people. This also highlights the importance of sacrificial offerings in the Old Testament as a means of atonement and worship.<p><b>and the officials contributed a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep for the assembly</b><br>The officials, likely including princes and other leaders of Judah, followed Hezekiah's example by contributing significantly to the Passover celebration. Their participation underscores the collective leadership's support for Hezekiah's reforms and the communal nature of worship in Israel. The additional thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep provided by the officials further emphasize the magnitude of the event and the unity among the leaders in promoting religious observance. This collective effort can be seen as a model of leadership that prioritizes spiritual renewal and community involvement.<p><b>and a great number of priests consecrated themselves</b><br>The consecration of a great number of priests indicates a revival of religious duties and a return to the proper observance of temple rituals. The priests' consecration was necessary for them to perform their roles in the Passover celebration, which involved offering sacrifices and leading the people in worship. This phrase highlights the importance of purity and preparation in serving God, as the priests had to be ceremonially clean to carry out their duties. The involvement of many priests also suggests a widespread renewal of faith and commitment among the religious leaders, aligning with Hezekiah's reforms and the overall spiritual revival in Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored the celebration of the Passover.
