His influence was pivotal in guiding Joash, especially in the early years of his reign. The act of taking two wives for Joash reflects the cultural practices of the time, where polygamy was not uncommon among royalty and leaders in Israel. This practice was often associated with political alliances and the desire to ensure a strong lineage. While the Mosaic Law permitted polygamy, it also warned against the potential pitfalls, as seen in the lives of figures like Solomon. Jehoiada's involvement in this decision underscores his authority and influence in the kingdom, acting as a father figure to Joash.<p><b>and he had sons and daughters</b><br>The mention of sons and daughters indicates the continuation of Joash's lineage, which was crucial for the Davidic line. The birth of children would have been seen as a blessing and a sign of God's favor, ensuring the stability and future of the kingdom. This phrase also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his descendants would continue to rule. The presence of both sons and daughters suggests a complete family unit, which was important for maintaining alliances and securing the throne. The emphasis on progeny connects to the broader biblical theme of God's covenant with David and the anticipation of the Messiah, who would ultimately come from this lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>A high priest who played a crucial role in the restoration of the Davidic line by protecting and guiding King Joash.
