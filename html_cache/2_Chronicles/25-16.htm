The prophet is delivering a message from God, which is a common role for prophets in the Old Testament. Prophets often faced opposition and danger when delivering God's messages, as seen with figures like Jeremiah and Elijah.<p><b>the king asked, &#8220;Have we made you the counselor to the king?</b><br>King Amaziah's question reflects a common attitude of resistance to prophetic messages, especially when they challenge royal authority. This mirrors other instances in the Bible where kings reject prophetic counsel, such as King Ahab with Micaiah (<a href="/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>). It highlights the tension between divine authority and human authority.<p><b>Stop! Why be struck down?&#8221;</b><br>The king's command to stop and his threat of violence reveal his unwillingness to accept correction. This reflects a broader biblical theme of the consequences of rejecting God's word, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/29.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>, which warns of sudden destruction for those who harden their necks against reproof.<p><b>So the prophet stopped,</b><br>The prophet's cessation of speech demonstrates obedience to the king's command, but it also signifies the completion of his duty to deliver God's message. Prophets were often required to speak regardless of the reception, as seen with Ezekiel, who was told to speak whether the people listened or not (<a href="/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a>).<p><b>but he said, &#8220;I know that God has determined to destroy you,</b><br>This statement is a declaration of divine judgment. The certainty of God's determination reflects the biblical principle that God's plans are sovereign and unchangeable, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>. It also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Amaziah, aligning with the biblical theme of divine retribution.<p><b>because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.&#8221;</b><br>The prophet identifies the king's actions and his refusal to listen as the reasons for impending judgment. This echoes the Deuteronomic principle of blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). It serves as a warning about the consequences of ignoring divine counsel, a recurring theme throughout the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>- The king of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the Lord but later turned away from God by worshiping the gods of Edom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet.htm">The Prophet</a></b><br>- An unnamed prophet sent by God to warn King Amaziah about his idolatry and the consequences of his actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>- The southern kingdom of Israel, over which Amaziah reigned.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>- A neighboring nation defeated by Amaziah, whose gods he foolishly adopted, leading to his downfall.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>- The divine decision to bring destruction upon Amaziah due to his disobedience and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Amaziah's pride led him to reject wise counsel.
