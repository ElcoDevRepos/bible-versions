The use of cypress in the temple signifies the importance and permanence of the structure. In biblical symbolism, cypress can represent strength and immortality, reflecting the eternal nature of God's presence. The main room, or the Holy Place, was a central part of the temple where priests performed daily rituals, emphasizing the sacredness of this space.<p><b>which he overlaid with fine gold</b><br>Gold is a symbol of purity, divinity, and kingship throughout the Bible. The overlaying of cypress with gold in the temple signifies the holiness and glory of God. This lavish use of gold reflects the wealth and splendor of Solomon's reign and the importance of the temple as a dwelling place for God's presence. The use of gold in the temple also connects to the heavenly visions described in Revelation, where the New Jerusalem is depicted with streets of gold, symbolizing divine perfection and glory.<p><b>and decorated with palm trees and chains</b><br>Palm trees are often associated with victory, triumph, and eternal life in biblical literature. They were used in the Feast of Tabernacles and are seen in the imagery of Revelation, symbolizing the righteous who stand before God. The decoration of the temple with palm trees may represent the victory and peace that come from God's presence. Chains, likely referring to decorative chains, could symbolize unity and connection, possibly representing the interconnectedness of God's people or the binding nature of the covenant. The combination of these elements in the temple's design highlights the beauty and complexity of God's creation and His covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.

This rendering is wrong. The verb is <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> given above (ver. 4). It is repeated in the next clause of this very verse as "overlaid," as also in vers. 7, 8, 9. The generic word "covered" would serve all the occasions on which the word occurs here. From a comparison of the parallel it becomes plain that the meaning is that the crone structure of floor and walls was covered over with wood (<a href="/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7, 15, 18</a>). That wood for the floor was <span class="accented">fir</span> (<a href="/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a>), probably slim for the <span class="accented">walls</span>, which must depend partly on the translation of this ver. 15. It would seem to say that (beside the stone) there was an inner stratum, both to walls and floor, of <span class="accented">cedar</span> (reason for which would be easy of conjecture). But another translation obviates the necessity of this inner stratum supposition, rendering "from the floor to the top of the wall." According to this, while the overlaying gold was on cedar for walls and ceiling (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>), it was on fir for the floor, which does <span class="accented">not seem what our</span> present verse purports, unless, according to the suggestion of some, "fir" be interpreted to include cedar. <span class="cmt_word">Set thereon palm trees and chains</span>.
