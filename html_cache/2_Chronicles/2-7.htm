The need for a skilled craftsman highlights the importance of artistry and craftsmanship in the construction of the temple, reflecting the glory and majesty of God. The emphasis on engraving suggests detailed and intricate work, which was a significant aspect of ancient Near Eastern art and architecture. This request also underscores the collaboration between Israel and other nations, as Solomon seeks expertise beyond his own people.<p><b>to work with gold and silver, with bronze and iron</b><br>These materials were commonly used in ancient construction and decoration, especially in royal and religious settings. Gold and silver were often associated with wealth and divinity, while bronze and iron were used for their strength and durability. The use of these metals in the temple signifies the splendor and permanence of God's dwelling place. This also reflects the wealth and resources available to Solomon, fulfilling the promise of prosperity given to Israel.<p><b>and with purple, crimson, and blue yarn</b><br>These colors were highly valued in the ancient world, often associated with royalty and the divine. Purple, in particular, was a symbol of nobility and was produced from the costly dye of the murex snail. Crimson and blue also held significant cultural and religious meanings. The use of these colors in the temple's construction and decoration would have conveyed the sacredness and royal status of the temple as the house of God.<p><b>He will work with my craftsmen in Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>This phrase indicates the collaboration between foreign and local artisans, showing the unity and cooperation in the temple's construction. The craftsmen in Judah and Jerusalem were likely trained and prepared by David, who had gathered materials and plans for the temple. This collaboration also symbolizes the gathering of diverse talents and resources for the service of God, reflecting the unity of God's people.<p><b>whom my father David provided</b><br>David's preparation for the temple, though he was not allowed to build it, demonstrates his dedication and vision for a permanent dwelling place for God. David's provision of craftsmen and materials laid the foundation for Solomon's successful completion of the temple. This continuity between David and Solomon highlights the fulfillment of God's promises and the importance of generational faithfulness in God's plan.

By comparison of ver. 3, it appears that Solomon makes of Hiram's services to David his father a very plea why his own requests addressed now to Hiram should be granted. If we may be guided by the <span class="accented">form</span> of the expressions used in <a href="/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11, 12</a>, Hiram had in the first instance volunteered help to David, and had not waited to be applied to by David. This would show us more clearly the force of Solomon's plea. Further, if we note the language of <a href="/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>, we may be disposed to think that it fills a gap in our present connection, and indicates that, though Solomon appears here to have had to take the initiative, an easy opportunity was opened, in the courteous embassy sent him in the persons of Hiram's "servants." That the king of this most privileged, separate, and exclusive people of Israel (and <span class="accented">he</span> the one who conducted that people to the very zenith of their fame) should have to apply and be permitted to apply to foreign and, so to say, heathen help, in so intrinsic a matter as the finding of the "cunning" and the "skill" of head and hand for the most sacred and distinctive <span class="accented">chef d'oeuvre</span> of the said exclusive nation, is a grand instance of nature breaking all trammels, even when most divinely purposed, and a grand token of the dawning comity of nations, of free-trade under the unlikeliest auspices, and of the brotherhood of humanity, never more broadly illustrated than when on an international scale. The competence of the Phoenicians and the people of Sidon and those over whom Hiram immediately reigned in the working of the metals, and furthermore in a very wide range of other subjects, is well sustained by the allusions of very various authorities (already instanced under 1 Chronicles 14:1, and <span class="accented">passim</span>; Homer, 'Iliad,' 6:289-294; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:614; 15:415-426; Herod., 3:19; 7:23, 44, 96; Strabo, 16:2. &sect; 23). The man who was sent is described in vers. 13, 14, <span class="accented">infra</span>, as also <a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13, 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Purple, ... crimson, ... blue</span>. It is not absolutely necessary to suppose that the same Hiram, so skilled in working of gold, silver, brass, and iron, was <span class="accented">the</span> authority sent for these matters of various coloured dyes for the cloths that would later on be required for curtains and other similar purposes in the temple. So far, indeed, as the literal construction of the words go, this would seem to be what is meant, and no doubt <span class="accented">may</span> have been the case, though unlikely. The <span class="accented">purple</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). A Chaldee form of this word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) occurs three times in <a href="/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7, 16, 29</a>, and appears in each of those cases in our Authorized Version as "scarlet." Neither of these words is the word used in the numerous passages of Exodus, Numbers, Judges, Esther, Proverbs, Canticles, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, nor, indeed, in ver. 13, <span class="accented">infra</span> and <a href="/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>. In all these places, numbering nearly forty, the word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>. The purple was probably obtained from some shell-fish on the coast of the Mediterranean. The <span class="accented">crimson</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>). Gesenius says that this was a colour obtained from multitudinous insects that tenanted one kind of the flex (<span class="accented">Coccus ilicis</span>), and that the word is from the Persian language. The Persian <span class="accented">kerm</span>, Sanscrit <span class="accented">krimi</span>, Armenian <span class="accented">karmir</span>, German <span class="accented">carmesin</span>, and our own "crimson," keep the same framework of letters or sound to a remarkable degree. This word is found only here, ver. 13, <span class="accented">infra</span>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>. The <span class="accented">crimson</span> of <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>, and the <span class="accented">scarlet</span> of some forty places in the Pentateuch and other books, come as the rendering of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The <span class="accented">blue</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>). This is the same word as is used in some fifty other passages in Exodus, Numbers, and in later books. This colour was obtained from a shell-fish (<span class="accented">Helix ianthina</span>) found in the Mediterranean, the shell of which was blue. <span class="cmt_word">Can skill to grave</span>. The word "to grave" is the piel conjugation of the very familiar Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, "to open." Out of twenty-nine times that the verb occurs in some part of the piel conjugation, it is translated "grave" nine times, "loosed" eleven times, "put off" twice, "ungirded" once, "opened" four times, "appear" once, and "go free" once. Perhaps the "opening" the ground with the plough (<a href="/isaiah/28-24.htm">Isaiah 28:24</a>) leads most easily on to the idea of "engraving." <span class="cmt_word">Cunning men whom...
