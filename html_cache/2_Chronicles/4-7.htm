Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, was extensively used in the temple, indicating the sacredness of the place where God would dwell among His people. The lampstands are reminiscent of the single lampstand in the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>), which was a type of Christ as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The increase from one to ten lampstands may symbolize the expansion and fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<p><b>according to their specifications</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of following divine instructions precisely, as seen throughout the construction of the Tabernacle and the Temple. The specifications likely refer to the detailed instructions given by God, similar to those provided to Moses for the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>). This adherence to divine design underscores the principle that worship and service to God must align with His revealed will.<p><b>and placed them in the temple</b><br>The placement of the lampstands in the temple highlights their role in illuminating the holy place, symbolizing the presence and guidance of God. The temple, as the central place of worship, was where God's glory dwelled among His people. The lampstands' presence in the temple signifies the light of God's truth and His covenant relationship with Israel.<p><b>five on the south side and five on the north</b><br>The symmetrical arrangement of the lampstands, five on each side, reflects the order and balance in God's creation and His dwelling place. This arrangement may also symbolize completeness and perfection, as the number ten often represents in biblical numerology. The positioning on the south and north sides ensures that the entire holy place is illuminated, symbolizing the pervasive and all-encompassing nature of God's light and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.
