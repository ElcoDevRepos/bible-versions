Mount Seir was the region inhabited by the Edomites, descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. This internal conflict among these groups highlights the longstanding tensions between the descendants of Abraham and Lot. The rising up against Mount Seir can be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment, as the Edomites had historically opposed Israel (see <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>). This event also demonstrates God's sovereignty in using the enemies of Israel to bring about His purposes.<p><b>devoting them to destruction</b><br>The phrase "devoting them to destruction" is reminiscent of the Hebrew concept of "herem," which means to devote something to God by completely destroying it. This was often commanded by God in the context of holy war, as seen in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). The destruction of the inhabitants of Mount Seir by their allies can be seen as a divine act of judgment, where God uses the enemies of His people to execute His justice.<p><b>And when they had finished off the inhabitants of Seir</b><br>The complete destruction of the inhabitants of Seir signifies the thoroughness of the judgment executed. This phrase underscores the totality of the defeat, leaving no survivors, which is a common theme in biblical narratives where God intervenes on behalf of His people. The historical enmity between Edom and Israel (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>) is resolved through divine intervention, showcasing God's ability to protect and deliver His people from their adversaries.<p><b>they helped to destroy one another</b><br>This self-destruction among the enemies of Israel is a recurring biblical motif, where God causes confusion among opposing forces (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>). It serves as a testament to God's power to save His people without them having to engage in battle. This miraculous deliverance prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, where the forces of evil are defeated through divine intervention rather than human effort. The self-destruction of these nations also foreshadows the eventual downfall of all who oppose God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A group descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.
