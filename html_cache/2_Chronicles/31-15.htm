Hezekiah's authority was significant in re-establishing the order and practices that had been neglected during the reign of his predecessors. His leadership is a type of Christ, who also brings order and restoration to God's people.<p><b>Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah</b><br>These names represent the priests who were entrusted with the task of distributing the portions. Each name has a meaning that reflects their roles or characteristics: Eden means "delight," Miniamin means "from the right hand," Jeshua means "the Lord saves," Shemaiah means "heard by the Lord," Amariah means "the Lord has promised," and Shecaniah means "the Lord dwells." These individuals were likely chosen for their faithfulness and integrity, reflecting the importance of trustworthy leadership in spiritual matters.<p><b>faithfully distributed portions</b><br>The distribution of portions refers to the allocation of the tithes and offerings collected for the support of the priests and Levites. Faithfulness in this task was crucial to ensure that the needs of those serving in the temple were met, allowing them to focus on their spiritual duties. This act of distribution is reminiscent of the early church in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a>, where the apostles appointed deacons to ensure fair distribution to the widows.<p><b>to their fellow priests in their cities</b><br>This indicates that the distribution was not centralized but took place in various cities where the priests resided. It highlights the decentralized nature of the priestly service, where priests lived among the people they served, fostering a closer relationship between the clergy and the laity. This practice ensured that the spiritual needs of the people were met throughout the land, not just in Jerusalem.<p><b>according to their divisions</b><br>The divisions refer to the organized groups of priests and Levites who served in the temple according to a schedule. This system was established by King David (1 Chronicles 24) to ensure that temple service was orderly and that all priests had the opportunity to serve. It reflects the importance of order and structure in worship, which is a theme throughout Scripture.<p><b>old and young alike</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the inclusivity of the distribution, ensuring that both the experienced and the less experienced priests received their due portions. It underscores the biblical principle of equality and fairness, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul speaks of the unity and equality of all believers in Christ. This inclusivity also points to the value of both wisdom and youthful energy in the service of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eden,_miniamin,_jeshua,_shemaiah,_amariah,_and_shecaniah.htm">Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah</a></b><br>These individuals were appointed to oversee the distribution of offerings to the priests and Levites.
