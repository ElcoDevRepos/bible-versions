Joash became king at a young age, and his early reign was heavily influenced by Jehoiada the priest. The phrase suggests a period of stability and growth in Joash's reign, allowing him to focus on religious reforms. This timing is significant as it reflects a period when Joash had matured and was able to make independent decisions regarding the spiritual and physical state of the kingdom.<p><b>Joash set his heart</b><br>The expression "set his heart" implies a deep, personal commitment and determination. In biblical terms, the heart often represents the center of one's will and emotions. Joash's decision to repair the temple was not merely a political or superficial act but a sincere desire to honor God. This reflects the influence of Jehoiada's godly mentorship and the importance of spiritual leadership in guiding the king's priorities.<p><b>on repairing the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, which had fallen into disrepair due to neglect and the idolatrous practices of previous kings. Repairing the temple was a significant undertaking, both physically and spiritually, as it symbolized the restoration of proper worship and covenant faithfulness. This act of restoration is reminiscent of other biblical figures who prioritized the temple, such as Hezekiah and Josiah, and foreshadows the ultimate restoration through Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). The temple's repair also highlights the importance of maintaining a place dedicated to the worship of God, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash</a></b><br>The king of Judah who began his reign at a young age and was influenced by the priest Jehoiada.

The phrase signals that Joash had matured beyond childhood; he had already reigned several years (compare <a href="/2_chronicles/24-1.htm">2 Chronicles 24:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The people had made covenantal reforms, tearing down Baal&#8217;s temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-17.htm">2 Chronicles 23:17</a>), yet the LORD&#8217;s own Temple still bore the scars of neglect and vandalism (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This timing highlights God&#8217;s patience: after cleansing the land of idolatry, He now prompts His king to restore true worship at the proper place (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joash set his heart</b><p>&#8226;

True reform begins within; outward projects flow from inward commitment (<a href="/psalms/119-10.htm">Psalm 119:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on repairing the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226;
