The fortified cities were strategically important for defense and trade. Archaeological evidence suggests that many of these cities, such as Lachish and Azekah, had significant fortifications. The capture of these cities indicates a severe breach in Judah's defenses and highlights the vulnerability of the kingdom due to its spiritual decline. This event fulfills the warning given in <a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25-26</a>, where it is prophesied that Shishak would attack Jerusalem because of the people's unfaithfulness to God.<p><b>and came as far as Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital city, was the political and spiritual center of Judah. Shishak's advance to Jerusalem signifies a direct threat to the heart of the nation. Historically, this event occurred around 925 BC, during a time when Egypt was regaining power after a period of decline. Theologically, this invasion serves as a divine judgment against Rehoboam and the people of Judah for abandoning the covenant with God. The fact that Shishak did not destroy Jerusalem but instead took treasures from the temple and the royal palace (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-9.htm">2 Chronicles 12:9</a>) can be seen as a merciful act of God, allowing the city to remain intact. This incident foreshadows future sieges of Jerusalem, such as those by the Babylonians, and serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, Rehoboam was Solomon's son.
