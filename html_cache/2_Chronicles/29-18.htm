King Hezekiah, a king of Judah, is known for his religious reforms and efforts to restore proper worship in the temple. His reign is marked by a return to the worship of Yahweh, contrasting with the idolatry of his predecessors. The Levites and priests, responsible for temple duties, report to Hezekiah, showing the king's active role in spiritual leadership. This reflects the biblical principle of leaders being accountable to God and His appointed representatives.<p><b>We have cleansed the entire house of the LORD</b><br>The cleansing of the temple signifies a renewal of covenant faithfulness and a return to proper worship practices. The temple, located in Jerusalem, was the central place of worship for the Israelites. Over time, it had been defiled by idolatrous practices, particularly under King Ahaz. The cleansing involved removing idols and purifying the sacred space, aligning with the Levitical laws of purity. This act symbolizes repentance and a desire to restore the relationship between God and His people, echoing themes found in passages like <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>, which speaks of creating a clean heart.<p><b>The altar of burnt offering with all its utensils</b><br>The altar of burnt offering was central to the sacrificial system, representing atonement and reconciliation with God. Located in the temple courtyard, it was used for sacrifices that symbolized the people's devotion and repentance. The cleansing of the altar and its utensils underscores the importance of purity in worship and the need for proper preparation before approaching God. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the sacrificial system's requirements as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>.<p><b>And the table of the showbread with all its utensils</b><br>The table of the showbread, situated in the Holy Place of the temple, held the bread of the Presence, symbolizing God's provision and covenant with Israel. The showbread, replaced weekly, was a reminder of God's sustenance and the people's dependence on Him. Cleansing the table and its utensils signifies a restoration of fellowship and communion with God. This element of temple worship points forward to Jesus, who declared Himself the "bread of life" in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, emphasizing spiritual nourishment and eternal life through Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore proper worship in the temple.

Nothing associated with sacrifice could remain defiled.<p>&#8226; For believers, the restored altar hints at the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>) and our daily offering of ourselves (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and the table of the showbread with all its utensils.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The table stood inside the Holy Place, holding twelve loaves that symbolized continual fellowship between God and His covenant people (<a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Purifying the table signals that renewed worship is not just about removing sin but also about restored communion.
