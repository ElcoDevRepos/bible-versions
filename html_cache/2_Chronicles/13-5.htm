According to ancient custom, salt was indispensable at formal meals for the ratification of friendship and alliance; and only a "salt treaty "was held to be secure. Salt therefore accompanied sacrifices, as being, in fact, so many renewals of the covenant between man and God. (<a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm" title="And every oblation of your meat offering shall you season with salt; neither shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meat offering: with all your offerings you shall offer salt.">Leviticus 2:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-24.htm" title="And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the LORD.">Ezekiel 43:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-7.htm" title="And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 24:7</a> in the LXX.)<p>The antique phrase, "covenant of salt," is otherwise important, as bearing on the authenticity of this speech.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-12.</span> - The idea of Abijah in this religious harangue, addressed or supposed to be addressed to the kingdom of the ten tribes, was good, and the execution was spirited. While, however, he preaches well to others, there are not wanting signs that he can blind himself as to some failure of practice on his own part. The points of the argument running through his harangue are correct, skilfully chosen, and well and religiously thrust home on the heart of his supposed audience. The practical trust of himself and his army are testified to in vers. 14, 15, and abundantly rewarded. This sequel-practical trust is the best credential of the sincerity of his foregoing appeal and harangue. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gave the kingdom... to David for ever</span>. With the thrice-repeated "for ever" of what we call <a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>, and the very emphatic language of the fifteenth verse in that passage, in the memory of Abijah, no one can say he was not justified by the letter and to the letter in what he now says. At the same time, how is it that Abijah does not in all fairness quote the matter of <a href="/2_chronicles/6-16.htm">2 Chronicles 6:16</a> <span class="accented">last</span> clause, and of its parallel, <a href="/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a> last clause, and of <a href="/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28-37</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-12.htm">Psalm 132:12</a>? <span class="cmt_word">Covenant of salt</span> (see <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-24.htm">Ezekiel 43:24</a>; <a href="/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>). The use of salt was ordered first for the meal offerings, which, consisting mainly of flour, did not need it as an antiseptic; afterwards it was ordered for "all" offerings, including the "burnt offering:" as surely as leaven was proscribed, salt was prescribed (<a href="/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>). "The covenant of salt" meant the imperish-ableness and irrevocableness of the engagement made between the two parties to the covenant The widespread and deeply significant use of it among other and heathen nations is remarkable indeed, and is attested by Pliny ('Hist. Natal 31:41) in forcible words: "Nulla (sacra) conficiuntur sine mola salsa" (Her., 2 Sat. 3:200; Virgil, 'AEn.,' 2:133; Hom., ' Iliad,' 1:449). Some think it a sufficient explanation of the text, "covenant of salt," that, especially in the East, solemn engagements and vows were often recognized and strengthened by hospitalities<span class="cmt_word">,</span> as shown to guests, and of these salt was an indispensable element. It is true that some of the ancient indications and descriptions of friendship and close friendships turned on phrases (similar ones, indeed, still existing) into which the word "salt" entered, but that these phrases arose from the fact that salt was so general a constituent of human food seems insufficient explanation, where we can find one of a more direct and more directly religious, or, as the case might be (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> with heathen sacrifices), superstitious birth. Religion and superstition between them have been the most world-wide, incalculable, and untraceable originators and disseminators of half the possible phrases of human language! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do you not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
