His reign is noted for its initial period of idolatry and apostasy, as he led Judah into practices that were abominable in the sight of God, such as idol worship and child sacrifice. This phrase suggests that there were many other deeds and events during his reign that are not detailed in this particular account, indicating a complex and multifaceted rule.<p><b>along with his prayer to his God</b><br>This refers to Manasseh's prayer of repentance, which is a significant turning point in his life. After being taken captive by the Assyrians, Manasseh humbled himself and sought the Lord, demonstrating the power of genuine repentance and God's willingness to forgive. This prayer is recorded in the apocryphal "Prayer of Manasseh," which, while not included in the canonical Bible, provides insight into his contrition and plea for mercy.<p><b>and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel</b><br>Seers, or prophets, played a crucial role in delivering God's messages to the kings of Israel and Judah. These prophets warned Manasseh of the consequences of his actions and called him to repentance. The reference to "the God of Israel" emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and His people, highlighting the seriousness of Manasseh's initial rebellion and the divine authority of the prophetic messages.<p><b>they are indeed written in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</b><br>This phrase indicates that there were other historical records, now lost, that documented the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah.
