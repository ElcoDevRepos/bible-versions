Sheba is often associated with the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia. Her visit to King Solomon highlights the far-reaching fame of Solomon's wisdom and wealth. The Queen of Sheba's journey signifies the recognition of Solomon's God-given wisdom by foreign nations, fulfilling the promise that Solomon's wisdom would be renowned (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). Her interaction with Solomon also prefigures the Gentiles' acknowledgment of the God of Israel, a theme that resonates throughout the Old Testament and finds fulfillment in the New Testament with the inclusion of Gentiles in the early Church.<p><b>The report I heard in my own country</b><br>The Queen of Sheba's acknowledgment of the report she heard underscores the widespread reputation of Solomon's wisdom and the prosperity of his kingdom. This report likely included accounts of Solomon's judicial decisions, his writings, and the grandeur of his court. The fact that such reports reached distant lands like Sheba indicates the extensive trade networks and communication channels of the ancient Near East. This also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon's name great (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12-13</a>).<p><b>About your words and wisdom</b><br>Solomon's wisdom is a central theme in the biblical narrative, often associated with his ability to govern justly and his deep understanding of nature and human behavior. His wisdom is a gift from God, granted in response to Solomon's request for discernment (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). The Queen of Sheba's focus on Solomon's words and wisdom highlights the divine source of his insight, which is not merely intellectual but also spiritual, pointing to the wisdom of God that surpasses human understanding (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>).<p><b>Is true</b><br>The Queen of Sheba's confirmation of the reports she heard serves as a testament to the authenticity of Solomon's wisdom and the truth of God's promises. Her declaration affirms the reliability of the accounts of Solomon's reign and the fulfillment of God's covenant with David, Solomon's father. This acknowledgment by a foreign dignitary also prefigures the recognition of Jesus Christ's wisdom and authority by those outside the Jewish community, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>), where Jesus refers to the Queen of Sheba's visit as a foreshadowing of the Gentiles' acceptance of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>A monarch from the region of Sheba, likely located in present-day Yemen or Ethiopia.

By seeking personal audience, measuring testimony against reality, and proclaiming the report as &#8220;true,&#8221; she models a journey from hearsay to conviction.
