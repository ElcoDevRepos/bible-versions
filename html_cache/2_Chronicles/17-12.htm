This phrase indicates not only military and political strength but also spiritual fortitude. Jehoshaphat's commitment to following the ways of his father Asa and seeking the Lord contributed to his growing strength. His reforms, which included removing high places and Asherah poles, reflect a dedication to purifying worship in Judah. This strength can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to bless those who are faithful to Him, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>.<p><b>and he built fortresses</b><br>Building fortresses was a strategic move to protect the kingdom from external threats. These fortifications would have been essential in a time when neighboring nations, such as Israel to the north and various other regional powers, posed potential threats. The construction of fortresses demonstrates Jehoshaphat's wisdom in ensuring the security and stability of his kingdom. This action aligns with the biblical principle of being prepared and vigilant, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>, which states, "The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the Lord."<p><b>and store cities in Judah</b><br>Store cities were crucial for maintaining the economic stability and resilience of the kingdom. These cities would have stored grain, oil, and other essential supplies, ensuring that Judah could withstand sieges or times of famine. The establishment of store cities reflects a prudent and forward-thinking administration. This practice is reminiscent of Joseph's actions in Egypt, where he stored grain during the seven years of plenty to prepare for the seven years of famine (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48-49</a>). Jehoshaphat's actions demonstrate a reliance on God's provision while also exercising wise stewardship over the resources entrusted to him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to strengthen the kingdom both spiritually and militarily.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with Jerusalem as its capital.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fortresses_and_store_cities.htm">Fortresses and Store Cities</a></b><br>Strategic military and economic structures built by Jehoshaphat to protect and sustain the kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/strength_in_god.htm">Strength in God</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's strength came from his reliance on God.

Earlier, &#8220;the LORD established the kingdom in his hand&#8221; (v. 5), showing divine backing is the foundation of every advance (cf. <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar wording is used of David: &#8220;David went on and became great, and the LORD God of Hosts was with him&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/5-10.htm">2 Samuel 5:10</a>).

Jehoshaphat honors proven wisdom: preserve what God entrusts.<p>&#8226; These fortresses served to deter aggression from surrounding nations like Moab, Ammon, and the Edomites (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical take-away:<p>&#8211; Faith trusts God; prudence plans.
