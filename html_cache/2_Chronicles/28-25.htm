Judah, the southern kingdom, was meant to be a place where the worship of Yahweh was centralized, particularly in Jerusalem at the temple. The mention of "every city" suggests a deliberate and systematic effort to introduce idolatry throughout the land, undermining the religious reforms of previous kings like Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah.<p><b>he built high places</b><br>High places were elevated sites often used for worship in ancient Israel and surrounding regions. These sites were typically associated with pagan rituals and were condemned by the prophets and reforming kings. The construction of high places by Ahaz represents a direct violation of the Deuteronomic law, which commanded the destruction of such sites (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>). This action reflects a turning away from the centralized worship in Jerusalem and a return to Canaanite religious practices.<p><b>to offer incense to other gods</b><br>Offering incense was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religious rituals, symbolizing prayers or offerings rising to the deity. The phrase "to other gods" highlights the syncretism and apostasy of Ahaz, who not only abandoned the worship of Yahweh but actively promoted the worship of foreign deities. This act of idolatry is reminiscent of the practices condemned by the prophets, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4-5</a>, where the burning of incense to Baal is specifically mentioned.<p><b>and so he provoked the LORD</b><br>Provoking the LORD refers to actions that incite God's anger and judgment. In the context of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, idolatry was seen as spiritual adultery, a betrayal of the exclusive worship owed to Yahweh. The provocation here is not just a breach of religious duty but a personal affront to God, who had chosen Israel as His people. This theme of provocation is echoed in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>, where Israel's idolatry is described as provoking God to anger.<p><b>the God of his fathers</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of the covenant relationship established with the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;and later reaffirmed with David and Solomon. By referring to "the God of his fathers," the text underscores the historical and spiritual heritage that Ahaz is rejecting. It also serves as a reminder of the faithfulness of God to His promises, despite the unfaithfulness of the people. This covenantal faithfulness is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>, where God identifies Himself as the God of the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his idolatrous practices and turning away from the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Ahaz reigned and led the people into idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Elevated sites where sacrifices and worship were offered, often associated with pagan rituals and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/other_gods.htm">Other gods</a></b><br>Refers to the deities of surrounding nations that Ahaz and the people of Judah worshipped, contrary to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord,_the_god_of_his_fathers.htm">The LORD, the God of his fathers</a></b><br>Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel, whom Ahaz provoked by his actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual decline and separation from God.

Though some earlier kings tolerated them (<a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>), Ahaz deliberately multiplied them.<p>- By &#8220;built,&#8221; the text stresses intentionality (cf. <a href="/2_kings/16-4.htm">2 Kings 16:4</a>); this was a construction program, not a careless drift.<p>- The action directly violated the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;4</a>) and mocked Solomon&#8217;s single temple, the divinely sanctioned worship center (2 Chron 6:6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to offer incense to other gods</b><p>- Incense symbolized prayer and devotion (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3&#8211;4</a>). Ahaz diverted that sacred symbol to &#8220;other gods,&#8221; a frontal assault on God&#8217;s exclusivity (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>- Earlier kings sometimes sacrificed at high places yet claimed to honor Yahweh (e.g., 2 Chron 20:32&#8211;33). Ahaz crossed another line by openly serving foreign deities (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>) including Molech, burning his own son (2 Chron 28:3).<p>- The perversion of incense echoes Nadab and Abihu&#8217;s &#8220;unauthorized fire&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;2</a>), which likewise drew divine wrath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and so he provoked the LORD</b><p>- &#8220;Provoked&#8221; conveys inflaming God&#8217;s righteous anger (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16, 21</a>). The covenant promised blessing for obedience and inevitable judgment for idolatry (<a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30&#8211;33</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s reaction soon came through military defeats (2 Chron 28:5&#8211;6) and the humiliating tribute to Assyria (2 Chron 28:20&#8211;21).<p>- <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a> reminds that &#8220;sin is a disgrace to any people&#8221;; Ahaz&#8217;s sins invited disgrace on Judah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the God of his fathers</b><p>- The phrase roots covenant faithfulness in history: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>- By rejecting the &#8220;God of his fathers,&#8221; Ahaz severed himself from the heritage of faith and God&#8217;s promises (2 Chron 21:7), contrasting with good kings who &#8220;walked in the ways of David&#8221; (2 Chron 29:2).<p>- The title also signals God&#8217;s unchanging character: though provoked, He remains the same God who delivered their ancestors (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>), ready to restore if they repent (2 Chron 7:14).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/28-25.htm">2 Chronicles 28:25</a> portrays King Ahaz&#8217;s thorough, intentional abandonment of covenant worship. He spread idolatry to every corner of Judah, erected illicit high places, and redirected sacred incense to false gods. These actions flagrantly violated God&#8217;s commands, ignited divine anger, and broke ties with the faith of Israel&#8217;s forefathers. The verse warns that widespread, deliberate compromise invites God&#8217;s judgment, yet it also highlights His consistent character: the same God of the fathers stands ready to bless obedience and restore the repentant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And in every several city</span> <span class= "bld">of Judah he made high places.</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/2_chronicles/28-2.htm" title="For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.">2Chronicles 28:2-4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And provoked to anger.</span>--<a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm" title="They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>.
