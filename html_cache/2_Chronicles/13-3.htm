The term "chosen men" indicates that these were select troops, likely the best warriors available, reflecting a strategic military decision. This event occurs during the divided monarchy period, following the split of Israel after Solomon's reign. The number 400,000, while possibly symbolic, suggests a significant force, emphasizing the seriousness of the conflict. The division of the kingdom was a result of Solomon's idolatry and the subsequent judgment, as prophesied in <a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>.<p><b>while Jeroboam drew up in formation against him with 800,000 chosen and mighty men of valor</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, assembles a larger force, described as "chosen and mighty men of valor." This indicates not only a numerical advantage but also the quality and experience of his troops. The disparity in numbers highlights the tension and stakes of the battle. Jeroboam's reign was marked by idolatry, as he set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>), leading Israel into sin. The conflict between Abijah and Jeroboam can be seen as a continuation of the spiritual and political struggles that began with the division of the kingdom. The battle serves as a backdrop for God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to David, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>, where Abijah reminds Jeroboam of the covenant God made with David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Rehoboam, and grandson of Solomon.

The numbers of the verse present a yet closer agreement with the results of that census as reported in <a href="/2_samuel/24-9.htm" title="And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.">2Samuel 24:9</a>; where, as here, the total strength of the Israelite warriors is given as 800,000, and that of Judah as 500,000. This correspondence makes it improbable that the figures have been falsified in transmission. (See Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/13-17.htm" title="And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.">2Chronicles 13:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Jeroboam also set the battle in array.</span>--<span class= "ital">While Jeroboam had drawn up against him.</span> Vulg., <span class= "ital">instruxite contra aciem.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - It is not within the province of an expositor to <span class="accented">assert</span> dogmatically that numbers like these in this verse should be deprived of one cipher, and that the slaughter of ver. 17 must be, consequently, similarly discounted. It would be, however, a great relief to faith to be able to <span class="accented">give proof</span> that this treatment would be true to fact. At present the numbers can be shown to be consistent with other numbers, such as those of the entire man-population (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-17</a>); and this seems the best that can be said in support of them. It does not, however, suffice to bring comfortable conviction. It is remarkable, among the difficulties that the question entails, that we do not get any satisfactory explanation as to how such vast numbers of slain bodies were <span class="accented">disposed</span> of in a compass of ground comparatively so small. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Abijah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_29.htm">Strong's 29: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abijah -- 'Yah is my father', an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1462;&#1488;&#1456;&#1505;&#1465;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ye&#8217;&#183;s&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
