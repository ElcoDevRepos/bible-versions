This indicates a level of autonomy and decision-making among the populace, even under the shadow of foreign powers like Egypt and Babylon. Jehoahaz, also known as Shallum, was the fourth son of King Josiah, a righteous king who had instituted significant religious reforms in Judah. The choice of Jehoahaz over his older brothers may reflect the people's desire for a continuation of Josiah's policies or a preference for a younger, more pliable ruler.<p><b>and made him king in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital city of Judah, was the political and spiritual center of the nation. The coronation of Jehoahaz in Jerusalem signifies the legitimacy and official recognition of his kingship. This act of making him king was a significant political move, as it was done without the immediate approval of Egypt, which had significant influence over the region at the time. The city itself, with its temple, was central to Jewish identity and worship, making the kingship in Jerusalem not just a political role but also a spiritual one.<p><b>in place of his father</b><br>Jehoahaz was made king following the death of his father, Josiah, who was killed in battle at Megiddo by Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt. Josiah's death marked the end of a period of religious reform and relative independence for Judah. The transition of power from Josiah to Jehoahaz was a critical moment, as it represented a shift from a godly king to one whose reign would be short and marked by subjugation to foreign powers. This phrase highlights the dynastic succession typical of the Davidic line, yet it also foreshadows the instability and decline that would follow Josiah's death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoahaz.htm">Jehoahaz</a></b><br>The son of King Josiah, Jehoahaz was chosen by the people to be king after his father's death.
