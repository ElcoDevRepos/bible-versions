Her visit signifies the widespread renown of Solomon's wisdom and wealth, which had reached distant lands. This fame was not only due to his political and economic achievements but also his wisdom, which was a gift from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>). The fame of Solomon can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon renowned (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>).<p><b>she came to test him with difficult questions</b><br>The queen's intent to test Solomon with riddles or hard questions reflects a common practice in the ancient Near East, where rulers would engage in intellectual exchanges to demonstrate wisdom and discernment. This encounter highlights the biblical theme of wisdom, which is central to Solomon's reign. The testing also serves to validate Solomon's God-given wisdom, as he successfully answers her questions (<a href="/1_kings/10-3.htm">1 Kings 10:3</a>).<p><b>She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan&#8212;with camels bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones</b><br>The mention of a large caravan and the specific items she brought underscores the wealth and significance of the queen's visit. Spices, gold, and precious stones were luxury items, indicating the prosperity of Sheba and the importance of the diplomatic relationship she sought with Israel. The gifts also reflect the ancient custom of bringing tributes to a king, which can be seen in other biblical accounts (e.g., <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10-11</a>).<p><b>And she came to Solomon and spoke with him about all that was on her mind</b><br>This phrase suggests a deep and comprehensive dialogue between the queen and Solomon, covering various topics. It indicates her genuine curiosity and desire to understand the source of Solomon's wisdom and the nature of his relationship with God. This interaction can be seen as a type of the Gentiles seeking the wisdom of Christ, as Solomon is often viewed as a type of Christ in his role as a wise and just king (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>A monarch from a wealthy and distant land, often associated with the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia.

Sheba</span>. This was the name of a descendant of Cush, a Hamite (<a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a>); also of a son of Joktan, a Shemite (<a href="/genesis/10-28.htm">Genesis 10:28</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-22.htm">1 Chronicles 1:22</a>); also of a son of Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a>). It is quite uncertain who of these constituted, or preponderated in, the country of Sheba here referred to. This is probably Saba, the capital of Yemen, an important province of Arabia, west of the Red Sea, north of the Indian Ocean, and extending upward nearly to Idumaea. The city was reputed splendid, the country wealthy, and long as the most southerly inhabited part of the world. If it were, as is believed, first occupied by Cushites it was afterwards peopled also by Joktanites and Jokahanites, as above. In addition- to the two celebrated allusions to it, ever memorable, see as other references, <a href="/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10, 15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22, 23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>; <a href="/luke/11-31.htm">Luke 11:31</a> (see also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1232). The hard questions consisted in riddles (<a href="/judges/14-2.htm">Judges 14:2</a>) and enigmas and primitive casuistry, in which the Arabians found some considerable portion of their mental gymnastics These, no doubt, bore some mild cousinly relationship to the proverbs and songs of Solomon, and his treasures of botanical and natural history facts (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Spices</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, here as also in the parallel.
