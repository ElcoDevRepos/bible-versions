Josiah was known for his religious reforms and efforts to restore the worship of Yahweh. The "day" mentioned is the day of the Passover celebration, a pivotal event in Jewish religious life.<p><b>the entire service of the LORD was carried out</b><br>This indicates that all the prescribed rituals and ceremonies were performed in full accordance with the Law of Moses. The meticulous observance underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the revival of proper worship practices under Josiah's leadership.<p><b>for celebrating the Passover</b><br>The Passover is a foundational Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egyptian bondage. It is a time of remembrance and gratitude for God's salvation. Josiah's observance of the Passover is notable for its scale and adherence to the ancient traditions, reflecting a return to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>and offering burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central aspect of Old Testament worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The altar of the LORD, located in the temple in Jerusalem, was the designated place for these sacrifices. This practice points to the seriousness of sin and the need for a sacrificial system, which Christians see as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>according to the command of King Josiah</b><br>King Josiah's command highlights his role as a reformer and restorer of true worship in Judah. His leadership was marked by a commitment to the Scriptures, as evidenced by his actions following the discovery of the Book of the Law in the temple. Josiah's reforms were a fulfillment of the covenantal responsibilities of a king to lead the people in righteousness and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored the observance of the Passover as commanded in the Law of Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passover.htm">The Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing redemption and obedience to God's commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_the_lord.htm">The Altar of the LORD</a></b><br>The sacred place where burnt offerings were made, representing worship and atonement for sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests_and_levites.htm">The Priests and Levites</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for conducting the sacrifices and ensuring the proper observance of the Passover.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the temple was located and where the Passover was celebrated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Josiah's actions demonstrate the importance of adhering to God's instructions, even when they have been neglected for a long time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership_in_spiritual_renewal.htm">The Role of Leadership in Spiritual Renewal</a></b><br>Josiah's leadership was crucial in leading the nation back to God.
