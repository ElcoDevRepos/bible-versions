His journey to Shechem is significant as it marks the beginning of his reign. Shechem holds historical importance as a city of refuge and a place where significant events in Israel's history occurred, such as the renewal of the covenant under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>). It is located in the hill country of Ephraim, a central location that was accessible to the tribes of Israel. Rehoboam's decision to go to Shechem rather than remain in Jerusalem, the established capital, suggests an attempt to unify the tribes and gain their support, as Shechem was a traditional gathering place for the northern tribes.<p><b>for all Israel had gone there</b><br>The phrase "all Israel" indicates the collective gathering of the tribes, emphasizing the unity and shared identity of the nation at this time. This assembly was not merely a formality but a crucial moment for the tribes to express their allegiance or dissent. The gathering at Shechem reflects the tribal confederation's practice of coming together for significant national decisions, reminiscent of earlier assemblies in Israel's history (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>). This moment is pivotal as it foreshadows the impending division of the kingdom, highlighting the fragile unity among the tribes.<p><b>to make him king</b><br>The act of making Rehoboam king was a formal recognition of his succession to the throne of his father, Solomon. This was a customary practice in the ancient Near East, where the people or representatives of the people would affirm the new king. The coronation at Shechem, rather than Jerusalem, underscores the political tensions and the need for Rehoboam to secure the loyalty of the northern tribes. This event is a turning point in Israel's history, as it leads to the division of the united monarchy into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The people's willingness to make Rehoboam king also reflects the Davidic covenant's enduring influence, as God had promised David that his descendants would rule Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). However, Rehoboam's subsequent actions and the resulting division serve as a reminder of the conditional nature of the covenant, dependent on the king's faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the grandson of David, Rehoboam is the central figure in this passage.

The verse is a hinge&#8212;rich with heritage, heavy with expectation&#8212;that turns the nation toward either continued unity under God&#8217;s rule or the painful division that rebellion brings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">To Shechem.</span>--<span class= "ital">Sh'kemah,</span> with accusative ending; Kings, <span class= "ital">Sh'kem.</span> "Were come," pf. plural; Kings, singular.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - This verse would have been far better placed last in the previous chapter, but now, left without note of time, it purports to tell us that (whereas by the last clause of the previous chapter "Rehoboam reigned in his" father Solomon's "stead," and had been <span class="accented">presumably</span> accepted as his heir and successor in Jerusalem and all Judaea) Rehoboam, now somewhat later on, repairs to Shechem (the ancient capital, and the prized position of the high-spirited tribe of Ephraim) to receive some final recognition as king from "all Israel."

To his son Abijah, by his favourite wife Maachah, who was the third of the wives that belonged to the house of Jesse, he bequeathed the kingdom. Wanting any positive Scripture statement of the matter of Rehoboam going to Shechem, we believe the explanation given above is the most probable, and that it was not any designed stroke of policy, with the view of conciliating or flattering Ephraim. Though no formal statement of it be made here, yet it is quite intelligible that the opinions, feelings, and readiness to express them on the part of Ephraim and "Israel" were well enough known, and had to be reckoned for. Shechem. For many reasons one of the most interesting geographical names in all the Old Testament. It was the ancient capital, as Shiloh, near to it, was the ancient seat of the national worship. It was situate in Ephraim, with Ebal to the immediate north, and Gerizim to the immediate south. Its upper slopelands (its position on which is possibly the origin of the name, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, "a shoulder" commanded a view of the Mediterranean.
