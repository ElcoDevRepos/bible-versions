The Edomites were descendants of Esau and had a long-standing enmity with Israel. This victory was significant as it demonstrated Judah's military strength and God's favor when Amaziah initially obeyed divine instructions. However, the victory also set the stage for Amaziah's subsequent spiritual failure.<p><b>he brought back the gods of the Seirites</b><br>The Seirites were inhabitants of Mount Seir, a region associated with Edom. Bringing back foreign gods was a common practice in the ancient Near East, symbolizing the conqueror's dominance over the defeated people's deities. However, this act was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and demonstrated a lack of faithfulness to Yahweh, the God of Israel.<p><b>set them up as his own gods</b><br>Amaziah's decision to adopt these foreign gods reflects a syncretistic approach to religion, blending elements of different faiths. This was a recurring issue in Israel's history, often leading to spiritual decline and judgment. It highlights the temptation to conform to surrounding cultures rather than remaining distinct as God's chosen people.<p><b>bowed before them</b><br>Bowing is an act of worship and submission. Amaziah's actions indicate a personal and deliberate choice to honor these idols, showing a heart turned away from God. This act of idolatry was not just a political or cultural misstep but a profound spiritual betrayal.<p><b>and burned sacrifices to them</b><br>Sacrifices were a central aspect of worship in the ancient world, symbolizing devotion and seeking favor from the deity. By offering sacrifices to these foreign gods, Amaziah was not only acknowledging their supposed power but also rejecting the sacrificial system established by God for Israel. This act would have been seen as a grave sin, leading to divine disapproval and eventual consequences for Amaziah and his kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the Lord but later turned away by worshiping foreign gods.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>A group of people descended from Esau, often at odds with Israel and Judah.

The verse we are studying immediately exposes the tragedy: a man freshly blessed by God forgets the very God who blessed him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He brought back the gods of the Seirites</b><p>Instead of destroying the idols of Edom as <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a> commands, Amaziah treated them like trophies. He repeated the folly of Israel in <a href="/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>, where the ark was treated like a lucky charm. Victory became an occasion for spiritual compromise rather than renewed devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He set them up as his own gods</b><p>This was no casual curiosity. &#8220;You shall have no other gods before Me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) was explicit, yet Amaziah installed these foreign images in a place of honor. Kings before him had made political idols&#8212;Jeroboam&#8217;s calves in <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>&#8212;but Amaziah personally adopted false gods, showing how success can seduce the heart (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He bowed before them</b><p>Physical posture revealed spiritual allegiance. Bowing, a gesture reserved for the Lord alone (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), signaled a transfer of trust. <a href="/psalms/115-8.htm">Psalm 115:8</a> warns that those who worship idols become like them&#8212;spiritually lifeless. Amaziah was on that path.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He burned sacrifices to them</b><p>Sacrifice sealed the covenant. <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a> attests that blood represents life; Amaziah offered what belonged to God to lifeless statues. His act mirrored Ahaz, who &#8220;sacrificed to the gods of Damascus&#8221; after a defeat (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>), yet Amaziah did so after a victory&#8212;making the offense even darker. By shedding blood to idols he invited the righteous anger that soon followed (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-15.htm">2 Chronicles 25:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a> records the swift slide from God-given victory to blatant idolatry. Amaziah&#8217;s heart, unguarded by gratitude and obedience, traded the living God for mute idols. The verse warns that success can breed spiritual amnesia, and that partial obedience&#8212;winning battles yet ignoring God&#8217;s commands&#8212;ends in ruin. Remaining faithful after triumph is as vital as trusting God before the fight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">AMAZIAH ADOPTS THE EDOMITE FORM OF WORSHIP, AND SPURNS A PROPHETIC WARNING</span> (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/25-14.htm" title="Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.">2Chronicles 25:14-16</a>).<p>(14) <span class= "bld">From the slaughter.</span>--<span class= "ital">From smiting.</span><p><span class= "bld">Brought the gods.</span>--The Assyrian inscriptions often refer to this custom of carrying off the idols of conquered countries.
