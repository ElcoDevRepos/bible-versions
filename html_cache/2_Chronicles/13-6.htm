His rise to power is significant in the history of Israel as he became the first king of the northern kingdom after the division of the united monarchy. His background as an Ephraimite is important because Ephraim was one of the leading tribes in the northern kingdom, often associated with leadership and influence. Jeroboam's story begins in <a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26-40</a>, where he is introduced as a capable leader under Solomon.<p><b>a servant of Solomon son of David</b><br>Jeroboam initially served under King Solomon, who was the son of David. Solomon's reign was marked by wisdom and prosperity, but also by heavy taxation and forced labor, which led to discontent among the people. Jeroboam's position as a servant or official under Solomon indicates his involvement in the administration of the kingdom, giving him insight into the grievances of the people. This context is crucial for understanding the eventual division of the kingdom.<p><b>rose up and rebelled against his master</b><br>Jeroboam's rebellion was a pivotal moment in Israel's history. It was not merely a personal ambition but was prophesied by the prophet Ahijah, who tore a new garment into twelve pieces, symbolizing the division of the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). Jeroboam's rebellion can be seen as a fulfillment of this prophecy. His actions led to the establishment of the northern kingdom of Israel, separate from the southern kingdom of Judah. This division had lasting religious and political implications, as Jeroboam set up alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan to prevent his people from going to Jerusalem, which is seen as a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh as prescribed in the Law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_son_of_nebat.htm">Jeroboam son of Nebat</a></b><br>Originally a servant of King Solomon, Jeroboam became the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The verse opens with &#8220;Yet,&#8221; signaling a sharp contrast to the Lord&#8217;s established order (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>, where Abijah reminds Israel of God&#8217;s &#8220;everlasting covenant&#8221; with David).<p>&#8226; It highlights that what follows is not an unfortunate accident but a deliberate departure from God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeroboam son of Nebat</b><p>&#8226; Jeroboam is introduced by name, immediately identifying the central human actor in the rebellion (<a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly attaches &#8220;son of Nebat&#8221; to him, underscoring a legacy of leading Israel into sin (<a href="/1_kings/15-34.htm">1 Kings 15:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21</a>).<p>&#8226; His notoriety stems not from lineage prestige but from choosing a path contrary to God&#8217;s covenant purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A servant of Solomon son of David</b><p>&#8226; Jeroboam began as a trusted official under Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>), tasked with building projects that benefited the kingdom.<p>&#8226; The description &#8220;servant&#8221; emphasizes that he owed allegiance to the Davidic king who reigned by divine appointment (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming Solomon &#8220;son of David,&#8221; the text reminds readers of the covenant line Jeroboam would oppose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rose up</b><p>&#8226; The phrase marks a calculated move rather than a spontaneous reaction (<a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeroboam &#8220;rose up&#8221; after receiving a prophetic word about the divided kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31</a>), yet instead of humbly waiting on God&#8217;s timing, he acted in self-interest.<p>&#8226; Rising up suggests ambition fueled by discontent, not submission to God&#8217;s overarching plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And rebelled against his master</b><p>&#8226; Rebellion here is personal and covenantal: personal, because Solomon was his immediate authority; covenantal, because rebellion against the Davidic king equates to rebellion against the Lord who installed that king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeroboam&#8217;s later establishment of rival altars at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;30</a>) demonstrates how political revolt quickly becomes spiritual apostasy.<p>&#8226; The chronicler underscores that such rebellion fractures national unity and invites divine judgment (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12, 18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/13-6.htm">2 Chronicles 13:6</a> exposes Jeroboam&#8217;s heart: a servant who refused rightful submission and instead fostered division. By highlighting the contrast (&#8220;Yet&#8221;), naming Jeroboam, recalling his duty to Solomon, and recording his deliberate uprising, the verse portrays rebellion as a conscious, culpable break from God&#8217;s ordained leadership.
