His reign is marked by political instability and spiritual decline. He was appointed by Pharaoh Necho of Egypt after the death of his brother Jehoahaz. Jehoiakim's reign was characterized by his rebellion against Babylonian control, which eventually led to the first Babylonian siege of Jerusalem. His acts include heavy taxation to pay tribute to Egypt and later Babylon, as well as the construction of lavish buildings using forced labor, which is condemned by the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-17</a>).<p><b>the abominations he committed</b><br>Jehoiakim's reign was marked by idolatry and moral corruption. He is known for his disregard for the prophetic word, as demonstrated by his burning of the scroll of Jeremiah's prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>). His actions are considered abominable because they directly opposed the covenantal laws of God, leading the nation further into sin and away from Yahweh. This period saw the continuation of pagan practices and the neglect of true worship, which were abominations in the sight of God.<p><b>and all that was found against him</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jehoiakim's reign was scrutinized and found wanting. The prophets, particularly Jeremiah, spoke against his leadership, highlighting his injustices and failure to adhere to God's commands. The phrase suggests a comprehensive record of his failures, both politically and spiritually, which contributed to the eventual downfall of Judah.<p><b>they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah</b><br>This refers to the historical records that chronicled the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah. These records, now lost, were likely official annals or court records that detailed the events of each king's reign. The biblical books of 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles draw from these sources, providing a theological interpretation of the historical events. The mention of these records underscores the accountability of the kings and the importance of historical documentation in understanding God's dealings with His people.<p><b>And his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place</b><br>Jehoiachin, also known as Jeconiah or Coniah, succeeded Jehoiakim as king of Judah. His reign was short, lasting only three months and ten days, before he was taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. This transition marks a significant moment in Judah's history, as it led to the first deportation of the Jewish people to Babylon, fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecies of exile (<a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24-30</a>). Jehoiachin's captivity is significant in biblical prophecy and typology, as his eventual release from prison in Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27-30</a>) foreshadows the hope of restoration and the coming of the Messiah, who would ultimately deliver God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned from 609 to 598 BC.
