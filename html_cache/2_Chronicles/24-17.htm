His influence was significant in guiding King Joash to follow the ways of the Lord. His death marked a turning point in Joash's reign, as Jehoiada's godly counsel was no longer available. This highlights the importance of godly leadership and mentorship in maintaining faithfulness to God.<p><b>however, the officials of Judah came</b><br>The officials of Judah, likely comprising nobles and leaders, approached King Joash after Jehoiada's death. This indicates a shift in influence and power dynamics within the kingdom. The officials' approach suggests they had their own agendas, which they could not pursue while Jehoiada was alive. This reflects the political maneuvering often seen in monarchies when a strong leader or advisor passes away.<p><b>and paid homage to the king</b><br>Paying homage was a customary act of respect and allegiance to a ruler. However, in this context, it may imply flattery or manipulation, as the officials sought to gain favor with Joash. This act of homage could be seen as insincere, aiming to sway the king's decisions for their own benefit. It serves as a reminder of the potential for corruption and the need for discernment in leadership.<p><b>and he listened to them</b><br>Joash's decision to listen to the officials marks a departure from the godly counsel he received from Jehoiada. This listening led to negative consequences, as Joash eventually turned away from the Lord and embraced idolatry. It underscores the vulnerability of leaders to external influences and the importance of steadfastness in faith.

Joash&#8217;s willingness to &#8220;listen to them&#8221; exposes a heart more attached to approval than to God.
