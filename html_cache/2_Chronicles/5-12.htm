Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun were prominent leaders among the Levitical musicians, each with a significant role in the musical worship of Israel. Asaph is often associated with the Psalms, having several attributed to him (e.g., <a href="/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50, 73</a>-83). Heman is noted for his wisdom and musical contributions (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>), and Jeduthun is mentioned in connection with prophetic music (<a href="/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-3</a>). Their sons and relatives indicate a hereditary role in temple service, emphasizing the importance of family lineage in maintaining the worship traditions.<p><b>stood on the east side of the altar,</b><br>The east side of the altar is significant as it faces the entrance of the temple, symbolizing the direction of the rising sun and new beginnings. This positioning highlights the importance of the musicians in leading worship and their role in the temple's ceremonial life. The altar itself was central to Israelite worship, representing sacrifice and atonement, and the musicians' proximity to it underscores their integral role in the sacrificial system.<p><b>dressed in fine linen</b><br>Fine linen was a symbol of purity and holiness, often associated with priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>). The attire of the Levitical singers in fine linen signifies their consecration and readiness to serve in the presence of God. This attire also reflects the splendor and dignity of temple worship, aligning with the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation unto God.<p><b>and playing cymbals, harps, and lyres,</b><br>These instruments were commonly used in ancient Israelite worship. Cymbals provided rhythm and emphasis, while harps and lyres added melody and harmony. The use of these instruments reflects the rich musical tradition in Israel's worship, as seen in various Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>). Music was a vital component of worship, enhancing the communal experience and facilitating the expression of praise and adoration to God.<p><b>accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.</b><br>The number 120 is significant, often symbolizing a complete and divinely appointed group (as seen in <a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a> with the 120 disciples). The priests sounding trumpets were part of the ceremonial worship, as trumpets were used to signal important events and gather the people (<a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>). The combination of singers and trumpeters created a powerful and unified sound, symbolizing the harmony and unity of worship in the temple. This grand assembly prefigures the heavenly worship described in Revelation, where multitudes praise God with loud voices and instruments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_singers.htm">Levitical Singers</a></b><br>These were members of the tribe of Levi, specifically chosen for their musical talents to lead worship in the temple.

Their position, attire, and sound proclaim God&#8217;s holiness, invite the people to joyful reverence, and prepare the house for the visible arrival of Yahweh&#8217;s glory. Today, believers are called to the same wholehearted, ordered, and holy praise, confident that the God who filled Solomon&#8217;s temple now indwells His gathered church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">All of them of Asaph . . . brethren.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">to all of them, to Asaph, to Heman,</span> &c., &c., <span class= "ital">and to their sons, and to their brethren.</span> This use of the particle <span class= "ital">le</span> (<span class= "ital">to, for</span>) is characteristic of the chronicler, whose style in these verses stands in marked contrast with the former part of the chapter.

So ends our inopportune Authorized Version parenthesis. But to what all this? It is a scene in a nation's history, in the universal Church's history; it is witnessed from heaven, and by Heaven's will recorded in the book on earth, which will endure through all generations, as long as the sun and moon endure, as ushering in the moment when, as described in the next verse, to the unanimous fervent adoration and praise of man, God bent a willing, gracious ear, and to earth the glory of heaven drew nigh. <span class="accented">Cymbals</span>. The word used here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), denoting strictly "pair of cymbals," occurs eleven times in Chronicles, once in Ezra, and once in Nehemiah. Another form of essentially the same word occurs once in <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a> and twice in <a href="/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>. This last passage notes two kinds of cymbals - the "loud" and the "high-sounding." It was the former of these that Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun used, and their use was probably to regulate or beat the time (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:375, 376; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 167, 2nd edit.). <span class="accented">Psalteries</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>). This word occurs twenty-eight times in the Old Testament, but of these it is translated (Authorized Version) four times as "viols" (<a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>; <a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>; <a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>); it is also once rendered "vessels of <span class="accented">flagons"</span> (<a href="/isaiah/22-24.htm">Isaiah 22:24</a>), but the margin offers the version "instruments of viols." While the cymbal was, of course, an instrument of percussion, the psaltery was one of strings - its use was as an accompaniment to the voice. The first mention of it is very interesting (<a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>). Compare also David's and Solomon's psaltery in <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-11.htm">2 Chronicles 9:11</a>. <span class="accented">Harps</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>). This word occurs forty-two times, beginning with <a href="/genesis/4-21.htm">Genesis 4:21</a>. <span class="accented">Trumpets</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e6;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). This word (including eleven of the personal forms of it, as e.g. the person <span class="accented">blowing the trumpet</span>) occurs just forty times, beginning with <a href="/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a>. It was the straight <span class="accented">tuba</span>, and was not, therefore, the same with the ram's-horn shaped <span class="accented">buccina</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>), generally rendered in the Authorized Version "cornet," but sometimes "trumpet;" the specialty of the cornet being to blow a sound for a signal or summons of some sort, whether secular as in war, or sacred as for some festival. The <span class="accented">trumpets</span> of our verse evidently (<a href="/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8</a>) were in a particular sense the instrument of the priests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1441;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;ul&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
