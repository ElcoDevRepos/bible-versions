A cubit is approximately 18 inches, making the total wingspan about 30 feet. This grand scale reflects the glory and holiness of God, as cherubim are often associated with divine presence, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a> and <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>. The cherubim's wings covering the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies signify God's throne on earth, echoing the cherubim in the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and the heavenly throne room (<a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>).<p><b>One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the wall of the temple,</b><br>Each wing measuring five cubits (approximately 7.5 feet) indicates the cherubim's significant size and the temple's grandeur. The touching of the wall signifies stability and the encompassing protection of God's presence. This detail emphasizes the temple as a sacred space, set apart for worship and communion with God, similar to the tabernacle's design in <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-20</a>.<p><b>and its other wing was five cubits long and touched the wing of the other cherub.</b><br>The connection between the wings of the cherubim symbolizes unity and harmony in God's creation and His divine order. This imagery can be seen as a type of Christ, who unites heaven and earth, reconciling humanity to God (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). The touching wings also create a protective covering over the Ark, representing God's covenant and His faithfulness to His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the vision and instructions given to his father, David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings depicted in the Holy of Holies within the temple.

A cubit is roughly 18 inches, so twenty cubits equal about 30 feet&#8212;exactly the width of the Most Holy Place (2 Chron 3:8).<p>&#8226; By filling the entire breadth, the cherubim visually announce that God&#8217;s throne room is completely under divine guardianship (<a href="/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Their size reminds worshipers that the Lord is not a regional deity squeezed into a box; His reach spans the whole sanctuary, echoing <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a> that &#8220;the earth is the LORD&#8217;s.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The wingspan also echoes the smaller mercy-seat cherubim of <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-20</a>, now magnified to match the permanent Temple.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the wall of the temple,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

God is &#8220;a wall of fire around her&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; This contact with the wall roots the heavenly symbol in earthly architecture: heaven and earth meet in the Temple, anticipating <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> where &#8220;the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and its other wing was five cubits long and touched the wing of the other cherub.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

it displays a thirty-foot spread of guardian wings that fill, secure, and unify the holiest space on earth. With one wing anchored to the wall and the other interlocking overhead, the cherubim proclaim God&#8217;s total coverage, steadfast protection, and perfect order.
