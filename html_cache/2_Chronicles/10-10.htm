In ancient Israel, elders were typically respected for their wisdom and experience (<a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>). The choice to consult peers rather than seasoned counselors reflects a common biblical theme of youthful folly (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>).<p><b>This is how you should answer these people who said to you</b><br>Rehoboam is being advised on how to respond to the Israelites' request. The people were seeking relief from the heavy burdens imposed by Solomon's reign, which included forced labor and high taxes (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). This moment is pivotal, as it determines the future relationship between the king and his subjects.<p><b>&#8216;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you must make it lighter.&#8217;</b><br>The "yoke" refers to the burdensome policies of Solomon, which were felt as oppressive by the people. The imagery of a yoke is used throughout scripture to symbolize oppression or servitude (<a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>). The request for a lighter yoke is a plea for relief and a more compassionate rule.<p><b>This is what you should tell them:</b><br>The young advisors suggest a response that is harsh and dismissive. This sets the stage for the division of the kingdom, as Rehoboam's decision will alienate the northern tribes. The advice contrasts with the biblical principle of servant leadership, as exemplified by Jesus Christ (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).<p><b>&#8216;My little finger is thicker than my father&#8217;s waist!</b><br>This metaphor is a boastful claim of greater strength and severity compared to Solomon. It reflects arrogance and a lack of empathy, which are condemned in scripture (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The imagery suggests an intention to increase the burdens rather than alleviate them, foreshadowing the rebellion of the northern tribes and the eventual split of the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.

Scripture repeatedly shows the danger of ignoring godly, time-tested counsel (<a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). By listening to companions who shared his upbringing and ambitions, the king positioned himself for folly. As <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a> warns, &#8220;Bad company corrupts good character.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is how you should answer these people</b><p>The youthful advisers do not merely suggest; they dictate the tone. Their confidence reflects worldly wisdom described in <a href="/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>&#8212;earthly, unspiritual, and ultimately destructive. Instead of seeking God&#8217;s direction (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>), they craft a hard line that will elevate the king&#8217;s pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who said to you, &#8220;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you must make it lighter.&#8221;</b><p>The northern tribes voice a legitimate grievance: Solomon&#8217;s building projects required heavy taxation and compulsory labor (<a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6-7</a>; 5:13-14; <a href="/2_chronicles/10-4.htm">2 Chronicles 10:4</a>). Their request echoes God&#8217;s heart for just leadership (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>). Far from rebellious, the plea seeks relief and fairness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is what you should tell them</b><p>Rehoboam is urged to issue a royal ultimatum. The contrast between godly leadership and tyrannical rule is stark. Jesus later teaches, &#8220;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them&#8230; but it shall not be so among you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-25.htm">Luke 22:25-26</a>; see also <a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).

In the next verse Rehoboam threatens scourges instead of whips (<a href="/2_chronicles/10-11.htm">2 Chronicles 10:11</a>). Rather than lighten the burden, he chooses intimidation, ignoring <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath.&#8221; The result is national division: ten tribes rebel (<a href="/2_chronicles/10-16.htm">2 Chronicles 10:16-19</a>), fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/10-10.htm">2 Chronicles 10:10</a> records poor counsel that feeds pride, rejects servant leadership, and sparks Israel&#8217;s split.
