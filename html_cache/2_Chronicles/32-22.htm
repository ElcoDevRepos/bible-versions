Hezekiah, the king of Judah, was known for his faithfulness to God, as seen in his reforms and efforts to restore proper worship (2 Chronicles 29-31). The deliverance from Assyria is a testament to God's faithfulness to those who trust in Him. This event is also recorded in <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a> and <a href="/isaiah/37.htm">Isaiah 37</a>, where God promises to defend the city for His own sake and for the sake of David, His servant. The salvation of Jerusalem is a type of Christ's ultimate salvation of His people, emphasizing divine deliverance from overwhelming threats.<p><b>from the hands of King Sennacherib of Assyria</b><br>Sennacherib was a powerful Assyrian king known for his military campaigns and conquests. The Assyrian Empire was the dominant power in the Near East during this period, and its capital was Nineveh. Sennacherib's invasion of Judah is historically documented in Assyrian records, including the famous Taylor Prism, which corroborates the biblical account of his campaign. The phrase underscores the might of the Assyrian threat and the miraculous nature of Judah's deliverance. This event demonstrates God's sovereignty over even the most formidable earthly powers.<p><b>and all others</b><br>This phrase indicates that the threat was not only from Assyria but potentially from other surrounding nations or internal threats. It suggests a comprehensive deliverance, where God protected Judah from multiple dangers. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to protect His people when they are faithful to Him, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a refuge and fortress for His people (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><b>and He gave them rest on every side</b><br>The concept of "rest" in the Old Testament often signifies peace and security, a cessation from warfare and conflict. This rest is reminiscent of the peace that Israel experienced under King Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24-25</a>) and is a foretaste of the ultimate rest promised in the Messianic age (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>). The phrase implies a period of stability and prosperity for Judah following the Assyrian threat, highlighting God's provision and care for His people. It also serves as a reminder of the peace that comes from trusting in God's protection and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who trusted in the LORD during the Assyrian siege.
