The promise referred to is found in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God assures David that his lineage will endure and that his son will build the temple. This covenant is central to the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical history as it leads to the birth of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise. The phrase underscores the reliability of God's word and His commitment to His chosen servants. It also reflects the importance of David in Israel's history, as he is often seen as a type of Christ, a shepherd-king who prefigures the coming Messiah.<p><b>What You spoke with Your mouth</b><br>This part emphasizes the verbal nature of God's promises, which are often delivered through prophets or direct revelation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, spoken words held significant power and authority, especially when coming from a deity. The phrase suggests that God's declarations are not mere words but are imbued with the power to bring about real change and fulfillment. This is consistent with the biblical theme that God's word is living and active (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><b>You have fulfilled with Your hand this day.</b><br>The fulfillment "with Your hand" indicates God's active involvement in bringing His promises to fruition. It suggests divine intervention and the tangible realization of His word. The phrase "this day" marks a specific moment in history when Solomon, David's son, completed the construction of the temple, a significant event in Israel's religious life. This fulfillment is a testament to God's sovereignty and His ability to orchestrate events according to His divine plan. It also serves as a reminder of God's ongoing work in the world, pointing forward to the ultimate fulfillment of His promises in the person and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem.

Solomon now testifies to that same track record.<p>&#8226; Because God&#8217;s promises are anchored in His character, they are as secure as He is (<a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>).

The kingdom exists for God&#8217;s purposes, not personal glory.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness to David also anticipates an even greater Son of David, fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22-23</a>), showing the continuity of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What You spoke with Your mouth</b><p>&#8226; Divine speech is never empty. &#8220;So shall My word be&#8230; it will accomplish what I please&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; From creation onward, God&#8217;s words are deeds (<a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>).

The construction of the temple proves that power at work.<p>&#8226; Solomon echoes an earlier confession: &#8220;Now the LORD has fulfilled the promise He made&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-20.htm">1 Kings 8:20</a>). What began as words is now stone, cedar, and gold.<p>&#8226; The completed temple is a tangible sign that all God&#8217;s promises&#8212;past, present, and future&#8212;will likewise be completed (<a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68-70</a>).
