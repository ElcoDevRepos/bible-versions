These basins were used for ceremonial washing, a practice rooted in the Mosaic Law, which emphasized purity and cleanliness before God. The number ten often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, suggesting the thoroughness of the purification process. The basins were likely made of bronze, a common material for temple implements, signifying strength and endurance.<p><b>and placed five on the south side and five on the north.</b><br>The strategic placement of the basins on both sides of the temple courtyard ensured accessibility for the priests performing their duties. This arrangement reflects the order and symmetry characteristic of Solomon's temple, which was designed to reflect the divine order. The north and south placement may also symbolize the inclusivity of God's covenant, extending to all directions and peoples.<p><b>The parts of the burnt offering were rinsed in them,</b><br>The burnt offerings were a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The rinsing of the parts in the basins highlights the importance of ritual purity and the separation of holy from common. This practice underscores the seriousness of approaching God with reverence and the need for cleansing from sin, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>but the priests used the Sea for washing.</b><br>The "Sea" refers to the large bronze basin, also known as the "Molten Sea," which was used by the priests for their own purification. This distinction between the basins and the Sea emphasizes the different levels of sanctity and the specific roles within the temple service. The Sea, being larger and more prominent, signifies the greater need for the priests to be pure as they ministered before God. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides the ultimate cleansing for believers, as referenced in the New Testament with the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple, including its furnishings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where the Israelites worshiped God, built by Solomon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_basins.htm">The Basins</a></b><br>Ten large containers used for washing the items used in burnt offerings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>A large basin used by the priests for ceremonial washing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>The Levitical priests who performed the temple rituals and sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_cleansing.htm">Symbolism of Cleansing</a></b><br>The basins and the Sea symbolize the need for purification before approaching God.
