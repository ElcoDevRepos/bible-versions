The "abominations" refer to pagan idols and practices that were detestable to God, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>. Josiah's reforms were comprehensive, extending beyond Judah to the former territories of the northern kingdom of Israel, indicating a desire to restore the entire nation to covenant faithfulness. This aligns with the Deuteronomic law, which called for the destruction of pagan altars and idols (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>). Archaeological evidence, such as the discovery of high places and Asherah poles, supports the historical presence of these abominations.<p><b>and he required everyone in Israel to serve the LORD their God</b><br>Josiah's reforms were not merely personal but national, enforcing a return to the worship of Yahweh. This echoes the covenant renewal ceremonies seen in the Old Testament, such as those led by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14-25</a>). Josiah's leadership is reminiscent of the kingship ideal in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>, where the king is to lead the people in obedience to God's law. His actions prefigure the messianic role of Christ, who calls all to serve God (<a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>).<p><b>Throughout his reign they did not turn aside from following the LORD</b><br>This phrase highlights the effectiveness and sincerity of Josiah's reforms. It suggests a period of spiritual revival and national obedience to God, similar to the reforms under Hezekiah (2 Chronicles 29-31). The steadfastness of the people during Josiah's reign contrasts with the frequent apostasy seen in Israel's history, as recorded in the books of Kings and Chronicles. This period of faithfulness can be seen as a fulfillment of the blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for obedience to God's commands.<p><b>the God of their fathers</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of faith from the patriarchs to Josiah's time. It underscores the covenant relationship established with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>). Josiah's reforms are a return to the worship of the God who delivered Israel from Egypt and established them in the Promised Land. This continuity is a central theme in the Old Testament, pointing to the faithfulness of God despite Israel's frequent unfaithfulness. It also foreshadows the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the promises made to the patriarchs (<a href="/luke/1-72.htm">Luke 1:72-73</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons /

The verse spotlights three truths: wholehearted obedience demands thorough cleansing, godly leadership can compel and inspire national faithfulness, and genuine revival bears lasting fruit&#8212;though every generation must choose afresh to walk with &#8220;the LORD, the God of their fathers.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">And Josiah took away all the abominations.</span>--Of idolatry.<p><span class= "bld">Out of all the countries . . .

But the unreality of these reformations by royal mandate is proved by the relapse which immediately followed upon the death of Josiah. The moral corruption which at this epoch was preying upon the vitals of the nation, and hurrying it swiftly to destruction, is revealed in the pathetic pages of the prophet Jeremiah.
