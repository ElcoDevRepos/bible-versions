In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/9.htm">2 Chronicles 9</a>, the Queen of Sheba had heard of Solomon's wisdom and wealth, which were renowned throughout the ancient world. This skepticism is a common human reaction, as seen in other biblical narratives, such as Thomas's doubt in <a href="/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>. The reports about Solomon's wisdom and wealth had spread far and wide, likely through trade routes and diplomatic channels, emphasizing the far-reaching influence of Solomon's kingdom.<p><b>until I came and saw with my own eyes.</b><br>The Queen of Sheba's journey to Jerusalem to verify the reports about Solomon underscores the importance of personal experience in confirming truth. This mirrors the biblical principle of seeking firsthand understanding, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>, where the Bereans examined the Scriptures daily to verify Paul's teachings. The Queen's visit also highlights the significance of Jerusalem as a center of wisdom and divine blessing during Solomon's reign, fulfilling God's promise to David in <a href="/1_chronicles/17-11.htm">1 Chronicles 17:11-14</a>.<p><b>Indeed, not half of the greatness of your wisdom was told to me.</b><br>This acknowledgment by the Queen of Sheba emphasizes the unparalleled wisdom granted to Solomon by God, as described in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>. Solomon's wisdom was not only intellectual but also practical, encompassing governance, justice, and understanding of nature. This wisdom is a type of Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>. The Queen's statement also reflects the biblical theme that God's blessings often exceed human expectations, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>.<p><b>You have far exceeded the report I heard.</b><br>The Queen's conclusion highlights the theme of God's abundant provision and the fulfillment of His promises. Solomon's reign is a foreshadowing of the Messianic kingdom, where Christ's glory and wisdom will surpass all human understanding, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the limitations of human testimony compared to the reality of God's work, encouraging believers to seek a deeper, personal relationship with God to fully appreciate His greatness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>A monarch from a wealthy kingdom, traditionally believed to be in the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia.
