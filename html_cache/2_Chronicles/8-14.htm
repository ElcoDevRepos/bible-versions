David, known for his heart for God, had set specific guidelines for temple worship, which Solomon respected and implemented. This reflects the importance of maintaining established traditions in worship and governance, ensuring that the spiritual legacy of David continued under Solomon's reign.<p><b>Solomon appointed the divisions of the priests over their service</b><br>Solomon's organization of the priestly divisions was a continuation of the system David had instituted, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>. This division ensured that the temple services were conducted efficiently and orderly. The priests were descendants of Aaron, and their roles were crucial for the sacrificial system, which was central to Israel's worship and atonement practices.<p><b>and the Levites for their duties to offer praise and to minister before the priests according to the daily requirement</b><br>The Levites, distinct from the priests, had roles that included assisting in the temple, offering praise, and performing music. Their duties were essential for the daily operations of the temple, as outlined in <a href="/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23-25</a>. The emphasis on praise underscores the importance of worship and music in the temple, reflecting the joy and reverence due to God.<p><b>He also appointed gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate</b><br>Gatekeepers were responsible for maintaining the security and sanctity of the temple. Their role was vital in controlling access to the sacred spaces, ensuring that only those who were ceremonially clean could enter. This practice is reminiscent of the cherubim guarding the Garden of Eden, symbolizing the protection of holy places.<p><b>for this had been the command of David, the man of God</b><br>David is referred to as "the man of God," a title that underscores his prophetic and kingly role in establishing the worship practices of Israel.
