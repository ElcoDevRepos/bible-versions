The unfaithfulness of the fathers refers to their idolatry and neglect of God's commandments, which is a recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah. This unfaithfulness is documented in various parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>, where the Israelites repeatedly turned to other gods. The acknowledgment of ancestral sin is significant in biblical narratives, as it often precedes a call to repentance and reform.<p><b>and did evil in the sight of the LORD our God.</b><br>The phrase "did evil in the sight of the LORD" is a common biblical expression used to describe actions that are contrary to God's will. This evil often involved idolatry, injustice, and neglect of the covenant. The phrase underscores the seriousness of their actions, as they were not just socially or morally wrong, but offensive to God Himself. This concept is echoed in passages like <a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22</a>, where Judah's sins are described in similar terms.<p><b>They abandoned Him,</b><br>Abandonment of God signifies a deliberate turning away from the covenant relationship established between God and His people. This abandonment often led to the worship of foreign gods and the adoption of pagan practices, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, where God laments that His people have forsaken Him, the "spring of living water." The act of abandoning God is a central theme in the prophetic literature, which calls the people back to faithfulness.<p><b>turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD,</b><br>The "dwelling place of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the center of worship and the symbol of God's presence among His people. Turning their faces away from the temple indicates a rejection of worship and a neglect of the sacrificial system that was central to maintaining the covenant relationship. This act of turning away is symbolic of a deeper spiritual apostasy, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, where the people are described as turning their backs on the temple.<p><b>and turned their backs on Him.</b><br>Turning their backs on God is a vivid metaphor for complete rejection and disobedience. It implies not only a physical turning away but also a spiritual and relational severance. This imagery is used throughout the prophets to describe Israel's unfaithfulness, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/32-33.htm">Jeremiah 32:33</a>, where God accuses the people of turning their backs to Him, not their faces. This act of turning away is contrasted with the call to repentance, which involves turning back to God with a renewed commitment to His ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship in the temple.
