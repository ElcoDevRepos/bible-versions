His father, Hezekiah, was a righteous king who enacted religious reforms, but Manasseh's youth may have made him susceptible to negative influences from court officials or foreign powers. The age of twelve indicates a lack of maturity and experience, which could have contributed to his initial decisions as king. This early start in leadership is reminiscent of other young kings in the Bible, such as Josiah, who also began his reign at a young age but chose a path of righteousness.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years</b><br>Manasseh's reign was the longest of any king in Judah or Israel, indicating a period of significant influence and impact on the nation's history. His lengthy rule allowed for the establishment of deep-seated idolatry and practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh, as detailed in the subsequent verses. The city of Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Judah, was profoundly affected by his policies. This extended reign also provided time for eventual repentance, as recorded later in his life, illustrating the possibility of redemption. The duration of his reign is a stark contrast to the often short and tumultuous reigns of other kings, highlighting the unique nature of his rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The son of Hezekiah, Manasseh became king of Judah at a young age.

Uzziah&#8217;s fifty-two years, 2 Chron 26:3).<p>- A long reign can be a blessing or a judgment; God allowed decades of influence, yet much of it was spent in wickedness (2 Chron 33:9).<p>- The extended timeline demonstrates God&#8217;s patience, &#8220;not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), which Manasseh finally did experience late in life (2 Chron 33:12&#8211;13).<p>- It also reveals how consequences can linger: his sins set patterns that Josiah later had to tear down (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/33-1.htm">2 Chronicles 33:1</a> records five straightforward facts&#8212;Manasseh, his youthful age, his legitimate accession, his location in covenant-centered Jerusalem, and his unusually long reign.
