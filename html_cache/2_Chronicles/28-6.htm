This rapid destruction serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. In biblical history, swift judgments often highlight the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance.<p><b>Pekah son of Remaliah</b><br>Pekah was the king of Israel, reigning during a tumultuous period marked by political instability and idolatry. His reign is noted for its aggression against Judah, reflecting the divided kingdom's internal strife. Pekah's actions were part of a larger conflict known as the Syro-Ephraimite War, where Israel allied with Syria against Judah.<p><b>killed 120,000 valiant men in Judah</b><br>The number 120,000 signifies a massive loss for Judah, indicating a significant military defeat. The term "valiant men" suggests that these were not ordinary soldiers but skilled and courageous warriors, highlighting the magnitude of the disaster. This event underscores the vulnerability of Judah when it strayed from God's protection.<p><b>This happened because they had forsaken the LORD</b><br>The phrase points directly to the spiritual cause of Judah's defeat. Forsaking the LORD implies a deliberate turning away from God's commandments and covenant. Throughout the Old Testament, Israel and Judah's prosperity and protection were contingent upon their faithfulness to God. This principle is reiterated in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience.<p><b>the God of their fathers</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenantal relationship between God and the ancestors of Judah, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It serves as a reminder of the historical faithfulness of God to His people and their obligation to remain faithful in return. The reference to "the God of their fathers" also highlights the continuity of God's promises and the expectation of loyalty across generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pekah_son_of_remaliah.htm">Pekah son of Remaliah</a></b><br>The king of Israel who led the attack against Judah.
