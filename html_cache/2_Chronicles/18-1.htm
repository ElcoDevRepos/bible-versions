His wealth and honor were seen as blessings from God, reflecting the prosperity that often accompanied obedience to God's commandments. This abundance is reminiscent of the blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a> for those who follow God's laws. Jehoshaphat's prosperity also highlights the contrast between the kingdoms of Judah and Israel during this period, as Judah was often more faithful to God than the northern kingdom of Israel.<p><b>and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage</b><br>Jehoshaphat's alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel, was solidified through the marriage of his son Jehoram to Ahab's daughter Athaliah. This political alliance was common in the ancient Near East as a means to secure peace and mutual benefit between kingdoms. However, Ahab was known for his idolatry and wickedness, particularly through his marriage to Jezebel, who promoted the worship of Baal. This alliance is seen as a compromise of Jehoshaphat's faithfulness, as it brought the influence of Ahab's idolatry into Judah. The consequences of this alliance are seen in the subsequent chapters, where Jehoshaphat's involvement with Ahab leads to near disaster. This decision serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of forming alliances with those who do not share the same commitment to God, echoing warnings found in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a> about being unequally yoked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and efforts to bring spiritual reform to his kingdom.

His faithfulness secured God&#8217;s favor (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>- The text reminds us that God is writing an ongoing story; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s choices cannot be read in isolation.

Riches can nurture complacency or create an illusion of self-sufficiency (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11&#8211;14</a>).

Material success did not insulate Jehoshaphat from the temptation to secure his position by worldly alliances. The verse is both a testament to God&#8217;s faithfulness and a cautionary signpost: prosperity invites vigilance, and partnerships formed apart from wholehearted devotion to the LORD can sow seeds of future trouble.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Now Jehoshaphat had.</span>--<span class= "ital">And Jehoshaphat got.</span><p><span class= "bld">Riches and honour in abundance.</span>--Repeated from <a href="/2_chronicles/17-5.htm" title="Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honor in abundance.">2Chronicles 17:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And joined affinity with Ahab.</span>--He married his son Jehoram to Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and Jezebel (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-6.htm" title="And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he worked that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.">2Chronicles 21:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-8.htm" title="And he answered him, I am: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.">1Kings 18:8</a>). The high degree of prosperity to which the king of Judah had attained is indicated by the fact that so powerful a monarch as Ahab entered into such an intimate connection with him. (The <span class= "ital">vav</span> of the second clause is not adversative, as Z&#8221;ckler asserts, but rather consecutive.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The purport of the verse is to let us into the secret that the <span class="cmt_word">riches and honour in abundance</span> of Jehoshaphat were, in fact, the snare by which he was led to entangle himself with one who, probably only on that account, was willing to be entangled by <span class="accented">affinity</span> with <span class="accented">him</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-6.htm">2 Chronicles 21:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2-4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-25.htm">2 Kings 8:25-29</a>). It is not hard to see how they would both lead him, if not always out of big and patronizing thoughts, to seek and also lay him open to be sought. When this verse says Jehoshaphat joined affinity, etc., it means that he had done so. to wit, not fewer than nine years before, in promoting or allowing, whichever it was, the marriage of his son Jehoram with Ahab's and Jezebel's daughter Athaliah. For the issue of this marriage, Ahaziah, took the throne at the age of twenty-two years, thirteen years hence from this seventeenth year of his grandfather Jehoshaphat's reign, the year of Ahab's death. But as we are told that Ahaziah was the <span class="accented">youngest</span> son of Jehoram and Athaliah (for explanation of which see <a href="/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>), the "joining affinity" must have been something earlier than nine years, and very probably came yet nearer the prosperity of the earlier years of Jehoshaphat's reign, with which would agree well the keynote touched again significantly here from our <a href="/2_chronicles/17-5.htm">2 Chronicles 17:5</a>. Comp. <a href="/2_kings/8-17.htm">2 Kings 8:17, 26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a> (which needs the correction of <span class="accented">twenty-two to forty-two</span>). Although it is certain that the act of Jehoshaphat was wrong in principle, disastrous in practice (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2, 3</a>), and threatened fatal consequences to himself (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31, 32</a>), yet it is not impossible to suppose his motives were for the most part good, and he may naturally have thought that the sunshine of his own peace and abundance might be the set time to win influence in and over Israel, rather than strengthen Israel in its ungodly independence. On the other hand, nothing could justify Jehoshaphat risking such intimacy of relationship with such a family, heedless of consequences, looking towards idolatry, which he should have known were overwhelmingly probable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/18-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Jehoshaphat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1435;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
