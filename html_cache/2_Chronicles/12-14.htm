His reign is marked by a departure from the ways of his forefathers, particularly in his failure to follow the covenantal laws established by God. The "evil" mentioned here refers to his idolatry and the abandonment of God's commandments, which led to spiritual and moral decline in the nation. This phrase highlights the biblical theme that leadership has a profound impact on the spiritual state of a nation, as seen in other kings of Israel and Judah.<p><b>because he did not set his heart</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. Rehoboam's failure was not merely in his actions but in his internal disposition. He lacked the intentional commitment to align his desires and decisions with God's will. This phrase underscores the importance of intentionality in one's spiritual life, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands to love the Lord with all one's heart.<p><b>to seek the LORD</b><br>Seeking the LORD involves a deliberate pursuit of God's presence, guidance, and will. It is a recurring biblical exhortation, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>. Rehoboam's failure to seek God contrasts with the example of his grandfather David, who is often described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). This neglect led to his downfall and the invasion of Judah by Shishak, king of Egypt, as a divine judgment. The phrase serves as a reminder of the blessings associated with seeking God and the consequences of neglecting this pursuit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign is marked by a division of the kingdom and spiritual decline.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which Rehoboam ruled after the split of the united monarchy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>Under Pharaoh Shishak, Egypt invaded Judah during Rehoboam's reign, which was a consequence of Rehoboam's failure to seek the Lord.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where Rehoboam reigned and where the temple of the Lord was located.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shishak's_invasion.htm">Shishak's Invasion</a></b><br>A significant event where Egypt plundered Jerusalem, symbolizing God's judgment on Rehoboam's unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_intentionality_in_seeking_god.htm">The Importance of Intentionality in Seeking God</a></b><br>Rehoboam's failure was rooted in his lack of intentionality.
