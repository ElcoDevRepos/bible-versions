It signifies God's ongoing relationship and covenant with His people. The Exodus is a type of salvation, prefiguring Christ's deliverance of humanity from sin. The event is recounted in the book of Exodus and is central to Jewish identity and faith, celebrated annually during Passover.<p><b>I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel</b><br>This indicates that until this point, God had not designated a specific location for His temple. The tabernacle, a portable sanctuary, was used during the wilderness wanderings and the period of the judges. This reflects God's sovereignty and His timing in establishing a permanent place of worship. The eventual choice of Jerusalem as the site for the temple is significant, as it becomes the spiritual and political center of Israel.<p><b>in which to build a house so that My Name would be there</b><br>The "house" refers to the temple, a central place of worship where God's presence would dwell among His people. The concept of God's "Name" being there signifies His presence, authority, and blessing. The temple serves as a foreshadowing of Christ, who is the ultimate dwelling place of God among men (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). It also points to the New Testament understanding of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<p><b>nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over My people Israel</b><br>This highlights that God had not yet appointed a permanent king over Israel until David. The period of the judges was marked by a decentralized leadership structure, with God Himself as the ultimate ruler. The eventual choice of David as king is significant, as it establishes the Davidic line, from which Jesus, the Messiah, would come. This phrase underscores God's sovereign choice and His unfolding plan for leadership in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His sovereign choices regarding Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, whom He brought out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing bondage and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_and_tribe_of_israel.htm">City and Tribe of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the various tribes and cities among which God had not yet chosen a specific place for His temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_for_my_name.htm">House for My Name</a></b><br>Refers to the temple, a central place of worship that God would eventually choose to be built in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_choice.htm">God's Sovereignty in Choice</a></b><br>God&#8217;s decisions are purposeful and sovereign.

God allowed these leaders, yet David marks the first explicit divine selection of a permanent royal line (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>).<p>- By pairing the temple site and Davidic kingship in the same verse, Solomon shows their shared origin in God&#8217;s sovereign election.<p>- Cross reference: &#8220;I have found David My servant; with My sacred oil I have anointed him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>).

The verse spotlights His sovereignty, faithfulness, and purposeful timing: He rescued Israel, then selected Jerusalem for His Name and David&#8217;s line for the throne. What once was mobile and provisional becomes settled and secure, testifying that the Lord alone directs His people&#8217;s destiny and desires to dwell among them forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">My people out of the land of Egypt.</span>--Kings, "My people <span class= "ital">Israel out of Egypt."</span> (Comp <a href="/2_chronicles/5-10.htm" title="There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.">2Chronicles 5:10</a>.)
