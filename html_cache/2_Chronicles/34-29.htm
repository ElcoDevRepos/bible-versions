In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/34.htm">2 Chronicles 34</a>, the king is Josiah, who became king of Judah at a young age and was known for his reforms and dedication to the worship of Yahweh. His summoning of the elders signifies a call to action and a desire to involve the nation's leaders in the spiritual renewal he is initiating. This reflects the biblical principle of leaders taking responsibility for guiding their people in righteousness, as seen in other instances such as Moses summoning the elders of Israel (<a href="/exodus/19-7.htm">Exodus 19:7</a>).<p><b>all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</b><br>The elders were the respected leaders and decision-makers within the community, often representing the tribes and families of Israel. By summoning all the elders, Josiah is ensuring that the entire nation is represented and involved in the covenant renewal process. This act underscores the importance of collective responsibility and unity in spiritual matters. Judah and Jerusalem are specifically mentioned, highlighting the centrality of Jerusalem as the political and religious heart of the kingdom. This gathering of elders can be compared to other significant assemblies in Israel's history, such as the gathering at Shechem under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>) and the assembly during King Hezekiah's reforms (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh.
