These ships symbolize the extensive trade networks and wealth during King Solomon's reign, highlighting his wisdom and ability to expand Israel's influence.<p><b>that went with Hiram&#8217;s servants</b><br>Hiram, the king of Tyre, was an ally of Solomon. This partnership underscores the political and economic alliances Solomon formed, which were crucial for his building projects, including the Temple.

Gold and silver were symbols of wealth and power, while ivory was a luxury item.

It is generally assumed that the words of the chronicler are an erroneous paraphrase of the expression, "Tarshish fleet," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a fleet of ships fitted for long voyages. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/2-16.htm" title="And on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all pleasant pictures.">Isaiah 2:16</a>.) The identity of the present fleet with that mentioned above in <a href="/2_chronicles/9-10.htm" title="And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.">2Chronicles 9:10</a> is not evident.

Some have identified Tarshish with Cape Tarsis in the Persian Gulf. (See Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/20-36.htm" title="And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.">2Chronicles 20:36</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - To Tarshish. The parallel has, in both clauses of its verse (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>), "ships <span class="accented">of</span> Tarshish." The order of the words in the former clause of our present verse, that compels us to read, "going to Tarshish," certifies the correct meaning. The word "Tarshish" (the subsequent <span class="accented">Tartessus</span>) covered a district in South Spain, as well as named a town and river, and stretched opposite the coast of Africa. Both coasts were beneath Phoenician rule, and a voyage to Tarshish would most naturally mean calling at many a port, and many an African port, from one and another of which all the imports here spoken of would be obtainable. The meaning of the Hebrew root of Tarshish is "to subjugate." The town lay between the two mouths of the river Baetis, now Guadal-quiver. Gesenius thinks that the writer of Chronicles says, in ignorance, "to Tarshish." and that the ships went to Ophir! These passages do not say that the voyage, whatever it was, took three years; much less that that length of time was necessary. Whether voyages were in Solomon's time made <span class="accented">from</span> the Red Sea, circumnavigating Africa, into the Mediterranean, is not certain. If they were such voyages, taken at a sauntering pace, with calls at many ports and easygoing delays, they may easily have consumed as long a space of time as three years! The theory that Tarshish was Tarsus in Cilicia is easily and conclusively negatived. The names in Hebrew of "ivory, apes, and peacocks" have been said to be of Indian origin. This is far from proved, and, as regards the first two, may be said to be sufficiently disproved. But if it all were so, still the fact that the Hebrew names were of an Indian language derivation would go very short way to prove that the Hebrew people got the things represented by them direct, or at all, from India. <span class="cmt_word">Ivory</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

In <span class="accented">all</span> these cases, two of them being in closest juxtaposition with the present and its parallel occasion, the word speaks of ivory that is being used, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as though it were manufactured material or ready for manufacture. But in our passage and its parallel, where the different word given above is found, it is manifest that it speaks of the material, so to say, in the rough, as just "tooth or tusk of ?;" but, further, what the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is is not yet ascertained. It is not a word known in the Hebrew vocabulary. Gesenius finds the Sanscrit <span class="accented">ibhas</span>, which signifies an "elephant;" Canon Rawlinsen finds in some Assyrian inscriptions a word <span class="accented">habba</span>, used of both elephant and camel, but probably having for its generic signification "a great animal;" Keil (on the parallel) finds a Coptic word, <span class="accented">eboy</span>, the Latin <span class="accented">elephas</span>, to which he prefixes the Hebrew article <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>. The Targum Jonathan shows at once <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>. Gesenius, in his 'Thesaurus,' calls also timely attention to <a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>, where we read, "They brought thee a present, horns of ivory <span class="accented">and</span> ebony" (Hebrew, Chethiv, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>; Keri, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). But no use of "ebony" happens to be mentioned in the connection of our present passages or subject. Thus it will be seen that no little ingenuity has been employed to hunt down this little word, though as yet not quite successfully. More may be seen in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 1:906. <span class="cmt_word">Apes</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., p. 390) says, "This word is identical with the name of the <span class="accented">monkey</span> in <span class="accented">Tamil."</span> Keil connects it with the Sanscrit <span class="accented">kapi</span>, but does not believe, with Gesenius, that the animal came from India, but Ethiopia. In a valuable note in the' Speaker's Commentary' we read, "It is found" (not stated <span class="accented">where</span>) "that the word was an Egyptian word, signifying a kind of monkey, in use in the time of Thothmes II., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about the time of the Israelites' exodus." (For Herodotus's testimony respecting ivory and apes in North Africa, see his 'Hist.,' 4:91.) <span class="cmt_word">Peacocks</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' p. 393') says a Tamil word, <span class="accented">tokei</span>, means "peacock." Keil proposes to consider it one of the later Romans' luxurious delicacies, <span class="accented">aves Numidicae</span>, from Tuoca, a town in Mauretania or Numi-alia. Some translate it "guinea-fowl," and some "parrots." The peacock did not belong to Africa, yet still it may have been purchaseable at some port there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/9-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king had</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1433;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(lam&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
