Solomon's building projects were extensive, including the Temple in Jerusalem and his own palace. The rebuilding of cities suggests a focus on infrastructure and fortification, which was crucial for maintaining control and security in the kingdom. This aligns with Solomon's reputation for wisdom and administrative prowess, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>.<p><b>Hiram had given him</b><br>Hiram, the king of Tyre, was a significant ally of Solomon. Their relationship was mutually beneficial, with Hiram providing materials and craftsmen for the Temple's construction (<a href="/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5:1-12</a>). The cities given by Hiram may have been part of a diplomatic exchange or treaty, reflecting the political alliances of the time. This exchange underscores the interconnectedness of ancient Near Eastern politics and the importance of strategic partnerships.<p><b>and settled Israelites there</b><br>Solomon's decision to settle Israelites in these cities indicates a strategic move to ensure loyalty and integration within the kingdom. By populating these areas with Israelites, Solomon could strengthen his control and influence over the region. This action also reflects the broader theme of the Israelites' settlement in the Promised Land, fulfilling God's covenant promises.

The parallel passage (<a href="/context/1_kings/9-11.htm" title="(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.">1Kings 9:11-13</a>) records a contrary transaction; that is to say, it represents <span class= "ital">Solomon as giving to Huram</span> twenty cities in Galilee, as a return for his past services. It is added that these cities did not please Huram, in consequence of which they got the name of "The Land of K?b-l" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"Like-nought"). The Authorised Version here assumes that the explanation of Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. viii.</span> 5, ? 3) is correct. That writer states that Huram restored the despised cities to Solomon, who thereupon repaired them, and peopled them with Israelites. Others assume an exchange of friendly gifts between the two sovereigns; so that Solomon gave Huram twenty Israelite cities (Kings), and Huram gave Solomon twenty Phenician cities (Chronicles): this seems highly improbable. The former explanation appears to be substantially correct. The chronicler, or the authority which he follows here. has omitted to notice a fact which seems to derogate from the greatness of Solomon, viz., the previous surrender of the territory in question to the Tyrian king; and has chosen to speak of Huram's non-acceptance or return of Solomon's present, as a <span class= "ital">gift.</span> He then goes on to tell of the future fate of the twenty cities. Solomon repaired or fortified them, and colonised them with Israelites; for this border-land was chiefly inhabited by Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm" title="Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.">Isaiah 9:1</a>, "Galilee of the Gentiles"). A border-land is naturally more exposed to the ravages of an invader; and the cities which Solomon ceded to Huram may have been in a half-ruinous condition. This would account for Huram's disappointment in them. The statement of our text, then, is neither an "effacement," nor a "travesty" (<span class= "ital">Reuss</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> nor even a "remodelling" of that of the older text "in favour of Solomon" (<span class= "ital">Z&#8221;ckler</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It replaces the older text by another statement which is equally true, and not incompatible with it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The cities which Huram had restored to Solomon</span>. <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a> explains the force of the word "restored" here, telling how it was Hiram had come by "twenty cities in the land of Galilee" by way of payment, or part payment, for the "cedar," "fir," and "gold" which he had given Solomon. It is evident that these cities were in need of repair; possibly they had not been previously in the occupation of the Israelites; if they had been, the transaction was scarcely legitimate on the part of Solomon (<a href="/leviticus/25-12.htm">Leviticus 25:12-33</a>), and we may suppose they had become largely deserted when made over to Hiram. It would not, however, be necessary to suppose either that Solomon had given them because they were poor property in his eyes, or that Hiram, whose good will and generous disposition are elsewhere specially notified, had returned them as a thankless gift or as a bad payment, but for the language of vers. 12, 13 (<a href="/1_kings/9.htm">1 Kings 9</a>.), which distinctly tells us that when Hiram inspected them they did "not please him," and that he named them "the land of Oabul" (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. p. 237). The probability is that, as cities on the borderland, they were what had been at present unoccupied by Israelites, were all the likelier in bad repair, and, unvalued by Hiram, were, when put into good repair by Solomon, such that Solomon might justly <span class="cmt_word">cause the children of Israel to dwell</span> in them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Solomon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#353;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
