Despite his piety, he chose not to heed the warning from Pharaoh Neco of Egypt. This decision marks a significant moment in Josiah's reign, highlighting a departure from his usual adherence to divine guidance. The phrase suggests a deliberate choice to confront Neco, indicating a potential lapse in judgment or a misunderstanding of God's will.<p><b>instead, in order to engage him in battle, he disguised himself.</b><br>Josiah's decision to disguise himself is reminiscent of King Ahab's actions in <a href="/1_kings/22-30.htm">1 Kings 22:30</a>, where Ahab also disguised himself in battle. This tactic was often used to protect a king from being targeted. However, it also reflects a lack of trust in God's protection. The act of disguise suggests a reliance on human strategy rather than divine intervention, which contrasts with Josiah's previous reliance on God.<p><b>He did not listen to Neco&#8217;s words from the mouth of God,</b><br>Pharaoh Neco claimed that his words were from God, which presents a theological challenge. It implies that God can use even foreign rulers to convey His will, as seen in other instances like Cyrus of Persia (<a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>). Josiah's failure to recognize this divine message through Neco indicates a limitation in his discernment, possibly due to nationalistic pride or a misunderstanding of God's broader plan.<p><b>but went to fight him on the Plain of Megiddo.</b><br>The Plain of Megiddo, a strategic military location in ancient Israel, was the site of many significant battles. It is also prophetically significant, as it is associated with the future battle of Armageddon (<a href="/revelation/16-16.htm">Revelation 16:16</a>). Josiah's choice to fight at Megiddo underscores the gravity of his decision and its historical consequences.

For "words of Necho," 3 Esdr. 1:26 has, "words of the prophet Jeremiah;" but there is no trace of such a warning in the extant prophecies bearing his name.<p><span class= "bld">In the valley of Megiddo.</span>--The valley of the Kishon, where Deborah and Barak had fought in the olden time against Jabin and Sisera. Herodotus (ii. 159) calls the place Magdolus. (See on <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Would not turn his face</span> (so <a href="/2_chronicles/25-17.htm">2 Chronicles 25:17</a> and its parallel, <a href="/2_kings/14-8.htm">2 Kings 14:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Disguised himself</span>.
