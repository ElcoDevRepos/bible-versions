In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/18.htm">2 Chronicles 18</a>, the king is Ahab, the ruler of the northern kingdom of Israel. Ahab's reign is marked by idolatry and opposition to the prophets of Yahweh. The phrase underscores the king's attempt to assert control over the situation, reflecting the common practice of kings issuing decrees that were to be followed without question. This mirrors other instances in the Bible where kings issue commands, such as King Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a>.<p><b>&#8216;Put this man in prison:</b><br>The man referred to here is Micaiah, a prophet of the Lord. Micaiah had prophesied against King Ahab, predicting his defeat and death in battle. Imprisonment of prophets was not uncommon when their messages were unfavorable to the ruling powers, as seen with Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15-16</a>). This reflects the tension between true prophets of God and the political authorities who often rejected divine warnings.<p><b>and feed him only bread and water:</b><br>This phrase indicates a form of punishment and deprivation. Bread and water were the most basic sustenance, symbolizing minimal provision and hardship. This treatment was intended to humiliate and weaken Micaiah, reflecting the king's disdain for the prophet's message. It also serves as a metaphor for spiritual deprivation, contrasting with the abundance of spiritual nourishment found in obedience to God (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>).<p><b>until I return safely.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Ahab's statement reveals his confidence in returning from battle, despite Micaiah's prophecy of his demise. This reflects a common human tendency to ignore divine warnings and rely on one's own understanding. The phrase is ironic, as it foreshadows Ahab's death in battle, fulfilling Micaiah's prophecy (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-33.htm">2 Chronicles 18:33-34</a>). This highlights the theme of divine sovereignty and the certainty of God's word, as seen in other prophetic fulfillments throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahab.htm">King Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel who sought counsel from prophets before going to battle.
