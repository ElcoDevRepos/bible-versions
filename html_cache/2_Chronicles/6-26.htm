In the context of Israel, rain was crucial for agriculture and survival. The withholding of rain was seen as a direct consequence of the people's disobedience to God, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16-17</a>, where God warns that turning away from Him would result in the heavens being shut. This concept is also echoed in the prophetic literature, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/14.htm">Jeremiah 14:1-6</a>, where drought is a sign of divine judgment.<p><b>because Your people have sinned against You</b><br>Sin, in the biblical context, is a violation of God's commandments and a breach of the covenant relationship between God and His people. The historical books of the Old Testament frequently recount instances where Israel's sin led to national calamities, including droughts. This phrase underscores the covenantal theology that obedience brings blessing, while disobedience results in curses, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>and they pray toward this place</b><br>"This place" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which Solomon had just dedicated. The temple was considered the dwelling place of God's name and presence on earth. Praying toward the temple symbolized seeking God's presence and favor. This practice is rooted in the belief that God hears prayers directed toward His holy dwelling, as seen in <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, where Daniel prays facing Jerusalem.<p><b>and confess Your name</b><br>Confession in the biblical sense involves acknowledging God's sovereignty and one's own sinfulness. Confessing God's name implies recognizing His character, authority, and the covenant relationship. This act of confession is a step toward repentance and restoration, as seen in <a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5-7</a>, where Nehemiah confesses the sins of Israel and appeals to God's covenant faithfulness.<p><b>and they turn from their sins</b><br>Turning from sin, or repentance, is a central theme in the Bible. It involves a change of heart and behavior, moving away from disobedience and toward obedience to God. This concept is emphasized throughout the prophetic writings, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30-32</a>, where God calls His people to repent and live. Repentance is a prerequisite for receiving God's forgiveness and restoration.<p><b>because You have afflicted them</b><br>Affliction here is understood as a form of divine discipline intended to bring about repentance and restoration. The idea that God uses hardship to correct and guide His people is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>, which speaks of God's discipline as an expression of His love. This affliction serves as a catalyst for the people to recognize their sin and return to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering a prayer of dedication for the newly built temple in Jerusalem.
