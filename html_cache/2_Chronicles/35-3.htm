Their role as teachers is emphasized in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>, where they are tasked with instructing Israel in the law. Being "holy to the LORD" signifies their consecration and dedication to God's service, as seen in <a href="/numbers/8-14.htm">Numbers 8:14-19</a>. This phrase underscores their responsibility to uphold and disseminate the spiritual and moral laws of the covenant.<p><b>Josiah said:</b><br>King Josiah was one of the few righteous kings of Judah, known for his reforms and dedication to restoring proper worship (2 Kings 22-23). His leadership is marked by a return to the covenant and a desire to purify the nation from idolatry. His instructions to the Levites reflect his commitment to reestablishing the temple's central role in Israel's spiritual life.<p><b>Put the holy ark in the temple built by Solomon son of David king of Israel.</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was the most sacred object in Israel, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with His people (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-22</a>). Its placement in the temple, built by Solomon, highlights the continuity of worship from David's reign through Solomon's temple construction (<a href="/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8:1-11</a>). This act signifies a return to the divinely ordained order of worship, as the temple was the designated dwelling place for God's presence among His people.<p><b>It is not to be carried around on your shoulders.</b><br>This instruction refers to the proper handling of the Ark, which was originally transported by Levites using poles (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a>). The prohibition against carrying it on shoulders suggests a cessation of its movement, emphasizing the stability and permanence of worship centered in the temple. This reflects a shift from the tabernacle's mobility to the temple's fixed location, aligning with God's promise of a permanent dwelling place (<a href="/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5-13</a>).<p><b>Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel.</b><br>Josiah's command to serve both God and the people underscores the dual responsibility of the Levites: to lead in worship and to minister to the community. This service is rooted in the covenant relationship, where obedience to God is linked with the well-being of the nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>). The call to service reflects the broader biblical theme of servant leadership, exemplified by Christ, who came to serve and give His life as a ransom for many (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored the observance of the Passover.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe set apart for religious duties, responsible for the care of the temple and instruction of the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Law, representing God's presence with His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon's_temple.htm">Solomon's Temple</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem built by King Solomon, a central place of worship for Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, which Josiah reinstated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_proper_worship.htm">The Importance of Proper Worship</a></b><br>Josiah's command to place the Ark in the temple underscores the need for reverence and proper worship practices.

The removal probably took place under Manasseh or his son, with the object of saving the sacred symbol from profanation. Or perhaps the repair of the Temple under Josiah had necessitated such a step. A third explanation takes the words in the sense of "Let the ark be, where it stands, in its proper place. Do not give a thought to your ancient function of bearing it about; but set your minds upon present duties." This, however, is too artificial.<p><span class= "bld">It shall not be a burden.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">hearing on the shoulder is not for you.</span> (Comp. the like statement in <a href="/1_chronicles/23-26.htm" title="And also to the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.">1Chronicles 23:26</a>; see also <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm" title="And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die.

We can only conjecture why the ark was not in its proper place, probably having been temporarily removed during Josiah's own restorations, or possibly having never been yet replaced from the date of some earlier removal of an iniquitous character and on the part of an iniquitous king. Secondly, as to the burden, some would explain the language as a <span class="accented">reminiscence</span> of the general and ever-applicable principle found in <a href="/1_chronicles/23-26.htm">1 Chronicles 23:26</a>. This, at any rate, would seem rather more satisfactory than the suggestion conveyed by the italic type of our Authorized Version. Perhaps the explanation may rather be that the ark had latterly again and again been shifted, and Josiah wishes to protest that neither for one reason nor another shall it be again moved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/35-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">To the Levites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1440;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(lal&#183;w&#238;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
