Asa was the third king of the Kingdom of Judah, ruling after his father Abijah. The context here is a period of religious reform and military success for Asa, following a victory over the Cushites. Prophets in ancient Israel often served as God's messengers, delivering divine guidance and warnings to the kings and the people.<p><b>&#8220;Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin.</b><br>Azariah addresses not only King Asa but also the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which composed the Southern Kingdom of Judah. This indicates that the message is not just for the king but for the entire nation. The tribes of Judah and Benjamin were the primary constituents of the Southern Kingdom after the division of Israel following Solomon's reign. The call to "listen" emphasizes the importance and urgency of the message.<p><b>The LORD is with you when you are with Him.</b><br>This statement underscores the conditional nature of God's presence and favor. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience and faithfulness to God result in His presence and blessing. This principle is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience and curses for disobedience. It highlights the reciprocal relationship expected between God and His people.<p><b>If you seek Him, He will be found by you,</b><br>This promise assures that God is accessible and willing to reveal Himself to those who earnestly seek Him. It aligns with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, which states, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart." This reflects the idea that God desires a relationship with His people and is responsive to their pursuit of Him.<p><b>but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.</b><br>This warning serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. It reflects the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> and <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, where disobedience leads to God's withdrawal and the nation's downfall. Historically, this principle is evident in the eventual exile of both the Northern and Southern Kingdoms due to their persistent idolatry and unfaithfulness. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of abiding in Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>, where separation from Him leads to spiritual barrenness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah_son_of_oded.htm">Azariah son of Oded</a></b><br>A prophet who delivers God's message to King Asa and the people of Judah and Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to lead the nation back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_benjamin.htm">Judah and Benjamin</a></b><br>The two tribes that made up the southern kingdom of Israel, over which Asa reigned.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises His presence and support to those who seek Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The underlying theme of the relationship between God and His people, emphasizing mutual faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_conditional_presence_of_god.htm">The Conditional Presence of God</a></b><br>God's presence and support are conditional upon our active pursuit and faithfulness to Him.

The prophet was the leader, the teacher, the suggester of the right and opportune thing to the people, but to the prophet the Lord himself was Leader, Teacher, Prompter, and it was exactly so now. To the very moment, the quickened moment of new thought and for new deed, divinest instruction and suggestion are ministered. The Lord is with you... will forsake you. The original occasion of the beautiful language and word of covenant in the heart of this second part of the verse is enshrined in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a> (see also <a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11-14</a>). It is just conceivable that these words by themselves are what are designated "the prophecy" (<span class="accented">and</span> "the prophecy") in ver. 8. They may be in the first place regarded as ancient quotations. They are also characterized by a certain self-containedness and weightiness of matter as compared with the historic illustrations of the following four verses.
