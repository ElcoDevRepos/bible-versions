In ancient Near Eastern culture, clothing was a symbol of power and identity. The attire of a king often included rich fabrics and colors, such as purple, which was associated with royalty. This imagery sets the scene for a formal and significant event, highlighting the gravity of the decisions being made.<p><b>The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah</b><br>This refers to King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah. The divided kingdom context is crucial here, as Israel and Judah were separate entities after the reign of Solomon. Ahab, known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel, contrasts with Jehoshaphat, who is generally portrayed as a godly king. Their alliance, often seen as politically motivated, raises questions about the influence of ungodly partnerships.<p><b>Were sitting on their thrones</b><br>The act of sitting on thrones indicates a position of judgment and decision-making. In ancient times, kings would sit on thrones to render judgments or make important decisions. This setting underscores the authority they wield and the formal nature of the proceedings. It also foreshadows the impending judgment from God through the prophet Micaiah.<p><b>At the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria</b><br>Threshing floors were often used as public meeting places due to their open space. The gate of a city was a place of legal and commercial transactions, as well as public gatherings. Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, was a significant city both politically and religiously. This location emphasizes the public and official nature of the event, as well as the central role of Samaria in Israel's history.<p><b>With all the prophets prophesying before them</b><br>The presence of prophets indicates the seeking of divine guidance, a common practice in ancient Israel. However, the narrative later reveals that these prophets were false, aligning with Ahab's idolatrous practices. This scene sets the stage for the confrontation between the true prophet Micaiah and the false prophets, highlighting the theme of true versus false prophecy. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of discerning God's true voice amidst deception.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>This refers to Ahab, the king of the northern kingdom of Israel, known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat,_king_of_judah.htm">Jehoshaphat, King of Judah</a></b><br>The king of the southern kingdom of Judah, known for his efforts to follow the ways of the Lord and his alliance with Ahab through marriage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/royal_attire.htm">Royal Attire</a></b><br>Symbolizes authority and the formal setting of the meeting, indicating the importance of the event.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thrones_at_the_threshing_floor.htm">Thrones at the Threshing Floor</a></b><br>The threshing floor was a place of judgment and decision-making, often located at the city gate, which was a central place for public gatherings and legal matters.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_prophesying.htm">Prophets Prophesying</a></b><br>These were likely false prophets who were attempting to please King Ahab with their messages, contrasting with the true prophet Micaiah who later speaks the truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_unequal_alliances.htm">The Danger of Unequal Alliances</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's alliance with Ahab serves as a cautionary tale about forming partnerships with those who do not share a commitment to God's ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_godly_counsel.htm">The Importance of Seeking Godly Counsel</a></b><br>The presence of false prophets highlights the need for discernment and the value of seeking counsel from those who truly speak God's truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership_and_influence.htm">The Role of Leadership and Influence</a></b><br>Leaders, like Jehoshaphat, have a responsibility to influence others towards righteousness rather than being swayed by ungodly influences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_public_decisions.htm">The Significance of Public Decisions</a></b><br>The setting at the city gate underscores the importance of making decisions that honor God in both public and private spheres.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/standing_firm_in_faith.htm">Standing Firm in Faith</a></b><br>Despite the pressure to conform, believers are called to stand firm in their faith and convictions, even when it is unpopular.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_18_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 18:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chronicles_18_9_Seek_God_first.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 18:9 illustrate the importance of seeking God's guidance first?

Fittingly, this setting prefigures how truth and error will soon be separated by Micaiah&#8217;s lone prophetic voice (18:19-27).<p>&#8226; City gates functioned as civic courts (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="/amos/5-15.htm">Amos 5:15</a>); here decisions about war and national destiny unfold in public view.<p>&#8226; Samaria, Ahab&#8217;s capital (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>), represents the cultural center of the northern kingdom, yet its spiritual foundation is shaky (<a href="/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5-6</a>). God positions His warning right where it cannot be ignored (<a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With all the prophets prophesying before them</b><p>About four hundred prophets deliver a unified, upbeat message (<a href="/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>), giving the impression of overwhelming spiritual consensus.<p>&#8226; Their unanimity lacks divine origin; they speak out of a deceptive spirit (18:21-22), illustrating the danger of mistaking majority opinion for God&#8217;s word (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The spectacle pressures Jehoshaphat, who still requests &#8220;a prophet of the LORD&#8221; (18:6)&#8212;a reminder that one faithful voice outweighs a chorus of error (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Public prophecy before the thrones highlights accountability: leaders are responsible for the voices they choose to heed (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/18-9.htm">2 Chronicles 18:9</a> paints a vivid tableau: two kings robed in splendor, occupying thrones of authority, positioned in a public arena, and surrounded by prophets eager to affirm their plans. The verse contrasts human pomp with divine sovereignty, exposing how easily leaders can cloak disobedience in ceremony and popular approval. True discernment demands hearing&#8212;and obeying&#8212;the solitary, sometimes uncomfortable word of the Lord, no matter how persuasive the alternative voices may sound.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And the king of Israel</span> . . . <span class= "bld">sat either of them on his throne.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Now the king of Israel</span> . . . <span class= "ital">were sitting each on his throne.</span><p><span class= "bld">Clothed in their robes.</span>--The pronoun, which is indispensable if this be the meaning, is wanting in the Hebrew.
