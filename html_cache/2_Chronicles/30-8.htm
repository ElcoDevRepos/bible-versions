The imagery of a "stiff neck" is akin to an ox resisting the yoke, symbolizing resistance to God's guidance and commands. Historically, this rebellion led to consequences such as the Babylonian exile. The call here is for repentance and humility, contrasting the past disobedience with a present opportunity for renewal.<p><b>Submit to the LORD</b><br>Submission to God involves acknowledging His sovereignty and aligning one's life with His will. This is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing obedience and faithfulness (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>). In the context of 2 Chronicles, King Hezekiah is urging the people to return to God, highlighting the importance of covenant faithfulness. This submission is not merely external but involves a heartfelt return to God, as seen in the broader narrative of Hezekiah's reforms.<p><b>and come to His sanctuary,</b><br>The sanctuary refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. It was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). Geographically, Jerusalem was the spiritual heart of Israel, and the temple was a symbol of God's covenant with His people. Hezekiah's invitation to come to the sanctuary underscores the importance of communal worship and the restoration of proper religious practices.<p><b>which He has consecrated forever.</b><br>The consecration of the temple signifies its dedication to God as a holy place (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>). The term "forever" reflects the enduring nature of God's promises and His desire for a perpetual relationship with His people. This phrase also points to the eternal nature of God's covenant, which finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>Serve the LORD your God,</b><br>Service to God is a central tenet of the faith, involving worship, obedience, and devotion (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>). In the historical context, Hezekiah is calling the people to renew their commitment to God, moving away from idolatry and back to the worship of Yahweh. This service is both a privilege and a responsibility, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>so that His fierce anger will turn away from you.</b><br>The concept of God's anger is tied to His justice and holiness. In the Old Testament, God's anger is often a response to sin and idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27-28</a>). Hezekiah's plea is for repentance to avert divine judgment, a theme echoed by the prophets. This turning away of anger is a precursor to the New Testament message of reconciliation through Christ, who bore God's wrath on behalf of humanity (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and called the people to return to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_israel.htm">Judah and Israel</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms during the time of Hezekiah, with Judah being the southern kingdom and Israel the northern.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fathers.htm">The Fathers</a></b><br>The ancestors of the Israelites who had turned away from God, leading to their downfall and exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who desires the people's repentance and return to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_submission.htm">Repentance and Submission</a></b><br>The call to not "stiffen your necks" is a call to repentance.
