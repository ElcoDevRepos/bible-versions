Hanani, his father, was also a prophet who had previously rebuked King Asa of Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a>). The role of a seer was to deliver God's messages, often involving correction or guidance. Jehu's confrontation with Jehoshaphat indicates the seriousness of the king's actions, as prophets were typically sent by God to address significant issues. This encounter underscores the importance of prophetic voices in maintaining the spiritual integrity of Israel and Judah.<p><b>and said to King Jehoshaphat</b><br>Jehoshaphat was the fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, known for his initial faithfulness to God and efforts to rid the land of idolatry (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>). However, his political alliances, particularly with the northern Kingdom of Israel, often led him into compromising situations. This address by Jehu highlights a moment of divine correction in Jehoshaphat's reign, emphasizing the king's responsibility to lead according to God's commandments.<p><b>&#8220;Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD?</b><br>This rhetorical question points to Jehoshaphat's alliance with King Ahab of Israel, who was notoriously wicked and led Israel into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>). By aligning with Ahab, Jehoshaphat inadvertently supported those who opposed God's ways. The question challenges the king's discernment and priorities, reminding him of the biblical principle of not being unequally yoked with unbelievers (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). It serves as a warning against forming alliances that compromise one's commitment to God.<p><b>Because of this, the wrath of the LORD is upon you.</b><br>The phrase indicates divine displeasure and impending judgment due to Jehoshaphat's actions. In the Old Testament, God's wrath often manifested as a response to covenant unfaithfulness, leading to consequences intended to bring about repentance and restoration. This warning reflects the seriousness of Jehoshaphat's misstep and serves as a call to return to faithful obedience. It also echoes the broader biblical theme of God's justice and mercy, where divine correction aims to realign His people with His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu_son_of_hanani.htm">Jehu son of Hanani</a></b><br>A prophet or seer who confronts King Jehoshaphat.

Jehoshaphat already tasted it when enemy charioteers nearly killed him (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31</a>).<p>- Continued compromise would bring further judgment, as seen later when his fleet is wrecked after partnering with Ahab&#8217;s son (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35-37</a>).<p>- <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21-22</a> shows that God&#8217;s wrath responds to misplaced loyalty, calling His people back to covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a> is God&#8217;s loving yet firm warning: aiding the wicked and bonding with those who despise the Lord invites divine discipline. Through Jehu, God calls Jehoshaphat&#8212;and every believer&#8212;to courageous separation from evil and wholehearted loyalty to Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer.</span>--The seer whose father had suffered for his reproof of Asa (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/16-7.htm" title="And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.">2Chronicles 16:7-10</a>), and who had himself already witnessed against Baasha, king of Israel (<a href="/context/1_kings/16-1.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,">1Kings 16:1-7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To meet him.</span>--<span class= "ital">Unto his presence</span> (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-17.htm" title="And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you: but if you be come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.">1Chronicles 12:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm" title="And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while you be with him; and if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.">2Chronicles 15:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">King.</span>--<span class= "ital">The king.</span> The prophets never shrank from facing the highest representatives of earthly power (comp. <a href="/1_kings/21-20.htm" title="And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy?

For Hanani, the faithful father of a faithful son, see <a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a>, where we read that he "came to Asa King of Judah," etc. Also for Jehu, see <a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>, where we read of his commission at the word of the Lord to rebuke Baasha the King of Israel, at a date upwards of thirty years before the present; and see <a href="/2_chronicles/20-34.htm">2 Chronicles 20:34</a>, which would lead us to infer, though not with certainty, that he outlived Jehoshaphat. The book called by his name, however, was not necessarily finished by him. It is evident that neither the word of the Lord nor the messengers and prophets of the Lord were bound by the orthodox limits of the divided kingdom. The powerful character and the moral force of the true prophet is again seen (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/15-1.htm">2 Chronicles 15:1-8</a>) in the way in which he was wont to <span class="accented">go</span> <span class="accented">out to meet</span> the evil-doer, though he were a king. We are accustomed to set the whole of this down to the account of the special inspiration of the prophet of old; yet <span class="accented">that</span> was but typical of the intrinsic force that truth faithfully spoken should wield in its own right in later times. Religion is <span class="accented">established</span> in the nation and people that know and do this, by the accredited teachers of it, vie. the plain rebuke of the wrong. <span class="cmt_word">Shouldest thou... love them that hate the Lord</span>? Strong suspicion must attend upon Jehoshaphat, that he had been not a little misled by answering to some personal fascination in Ahab. The prophet's rebuke is not that Jehoshaphat helped both Israel and therein Judah also against a common foe, but that he helped the ungodly, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore wrath upon thee</span>, etc. The significance of this sentence was probably not merely retrospective, glancing at the fact that Jehoshaphat returned to Jerusalem <span class="accented">minus</span> the victory for which he had bid, but was probably an intimation of troubles that should ripen, were already ripening for Jehoshaphat, in the coming invasion of his own kingdom (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jehu</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3058.htm">Strong's 3058: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehu -- 'the LORD is He', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;en-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Hanani</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1432;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2607.htm">Strong's 2607: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hanani -- the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the seer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1465;&#1494;&#1462;&#1492;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
