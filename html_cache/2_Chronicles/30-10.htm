The couriers were likely Levites or officials tasked with delivering the king's message. The act of traveling from city to city indicates a systematic and organized approach to reach all the people, emphasizing the importance of the message. This reflects the dedication to God's command and the desire for unity among the tribes.<p><b>through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh</b><br>Ephraim and Manasseh were two of the largest tribes in the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Historically, these tribes had been part of the division between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms after Solomon's reign. The inclusion of these tribes in Hezekiah's invitation to celebrate the Passover signifies an attempt to heal the rift and restore the unity of all Israel under the worship of Yahweh. This also reflects the prophetic hope of reunification found in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15-28</a>.<p><b>as far as Zebulun</b><br>Zebulun was located in the northern part of Israel, indicating the extensive reach of Hezekiah's invitation. This shows the king's desire to include even the most distant tribes in the religious reforms. The mention of Zebulun also connects to the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light coming to the lands of Zebulun and Naphtali, often interpreted as a messianic prophecy fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>but the people scorned and mocked them</b><br>Despite the earnest efforts of Hezekiah and his couriers, the response from many in the Northern Kingdom was one of ridicule and rejection. This reaction highlights the spiritual decline and hard-heartedness that had taken root in Israel. It serves as a reminder of the resistance often faced by those who seek to bring about spiritual renewal. This rejection can be paralleled with the response Jesus faced during His ministry, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, where He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/couriers.htm">Couriers</a></b><br>Messengers sent by King Hezekiah to invite the people of Israel to Jerusalem for the Passover celebration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim_and_manasseh.htm">Ephraim and Manasseh</a></b><br>Tribes of Israel located in the northern kingdom, representing the broader call to all Israelites to return to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebulun.htm">Zebulun</a></b><br>Another tribe in the northern kingdom, indicating the extent of the invitation across Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the call for a unified Passover celebration, seeking to restore proper worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the northern kingdom who responded with scorn and mockery to the invitation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_unity_in_worship.htm">The Call to Unity in Worship</a></b><br>Hezekiah's invitation to the Passover was a call for unity among God's people, transcending political and tribal divisions.

These couriers were not acting on their own initiative but on the king&#8217;s command, and, ultimately, on God&#8217;s directive to invite His covenant people back to covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; God has always used faithful messengers&#8212;think of Moses before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>), the prophets crying, &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25</a>), and the apostles whom Paul calls &#8220;ambassadors for Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Their journey shows the urgency of obedience. Like Philip who &#8220;ran&#8221; to meet the Ethiopian (<a href="/acts/8-30.htm">Acts 8:30</a>), these couriers move without delay because delayed obedience is disobedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from city to city</b><p>The phrase underlines thoroughness; no town was too small, no population too insignificant. Compare Jesus&#8217; sending of the seventy-two &#8220;into every town and place where He Himself was about to go&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Salvation&#8217;s invitation is comprehensive. When Jesus said, &#8220;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), He echoed this very spirit: house-to-house, city-to-city, life-to-life.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s grace is offered repeatedly. Even after centuries of idolatry, Hezekiah extends a fresh call, mirroring the patient pursuit found in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh</b><p>These tribal regions belonged to the northern kingdom&#8212;long estranged from Judah since the split under Rehoboam and Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>). Hezekiah&#8217;s invitation bridges that political and spiritual divide.<p>&#8226; Reconciliation is a divine priority. Hosea had foretold the reunification of God&#8217;s people (<a href="/hosea/1-11.htm">Hosea 1:11</a>), and Hezekiah acts in that prophetic stream.<p>&#8226; This anticipates Christ, who would later &#8220;make the two one&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>), uniting Jew and Gentile&#8212;and, in a nearer sense, north and south.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as far as Zebulun</b><p>Zebulun lies in Galilee, the northernmost reach of Israel. By citing this endpoint, Scripture stresses that the offer of Passover went to the very margins.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a> speaks of &#8220;Galilee of the nations,&#8221; the same region where Jesus would launch His ministry (<a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-16</a>). The consistent message: God&#8217;s light seeks out the darkest corners.<p>&#8226; No one is beyond the scope of invitation. From the temple steps in Jerusalem to remote Galilean hills, God&#8217;s call travels the full length of His land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the people scorned and mocked them</b><p>Reception was mixed; many ridiculed the couriers (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11-12</a> where some do humble themselves). Mockery is a tragically predictable response to divine overtures.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a> records later generations who &#8220;mocked God&#8217;s messengers, despised His words.&#8221; The pattern culminates in Christ, who was &#8220;mocked, insulted, spit upon&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Reasons hearts harden:<p>&#8211; Pride: &#8220;We have our own worship in Bethel and Dan&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p>&#8211; Tradition: &#8220;We&#8217;ve always done it this way&#8221; (<a href="/mark/7-9.htm">Mark 7:9</a>).<p>&#8211; Unbelief: &#8220;This can&#8217;t matter that much&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet scoffing never nullifies truth. Noah kept building (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>), Jeremiah kept preaching (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>), and these couriers kept traveling. Faithfulness is measured by obedience, not by applause.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/30-10.htm">2 Chronicles 30:10</a> shows God&#8217;s relentless grace, conveyed through obedient messengers who carry an all-inclusive invitation. Their city-to-city journey stretches across divided tribes to the distant north, illustrating that no barrier&#8212;political, geographical, or cultural&#8212;hinders God&#8217;s call. While many mock, the faithful still proclaim, and God still gathers those who will humble themselves. The verse therefore underscores both the breadth of divine mercy and the sad reality that some will scorn it, challenging every generation to choose response over ridicule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">So</span> <span class= "bld">the posts passed.</span>--<span class= "ital">And the couriers were passing.</span><p><span class= "bld">Even unto Zebulun.</span>--This tribe, which lay on the southern border of Naphtali, had suffered from Tiglath-pileser's invasion (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm" title="Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.">Isaiah 9:1</a>).
