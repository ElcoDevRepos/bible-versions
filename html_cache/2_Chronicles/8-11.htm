The City of David refers to the original stronghold of Jerusalem, which David captured and made his capital. Moving Pharaoh's daughter to a separate palace indicates Solomon's desire to honor her status while maintaining religious purity, as the City of David was closely associated with the worship of Yahweh. This action reflects the tension between political alliances and religious commitments in Solomon's reign.<p><b>For he said, &#8220;My wife must not live in the house of David king of Israel,</b><br>Solomon's statement underscores the sanctity of the house of David, which was not just a royal residence but a symbol of God's covenant with David. The house of David was meant to be a place set apart for the lineage through which God promised to establish His kingdom. Solomon's decision reflects an awareness of the need to keep the sacred distinct from the secular, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy.&#8221;</b><br>The ark of the LORD was the most sacred object in Israel, representing God's presence among His people. Its presence sanctified any place it entered, making it holy. Solomon's recognition of this holiness shows his understanding of the importance of maintaining the purity of worship spaces. This reverence for the ark connects to the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for His people to approach Him with reverence and purity. Solomon's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and maintained the holiness of God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh's_daughter.htm">Pharaoh's Daughter</a></b><br>She was one of Solomon's wives, likely married for political alliance purposes.

While Solomon&#8217;s solution fell short of full obedience, the verse challenges us to honor God&#8217;s holiness without compromise and to guard the spaces&#8212;physical and spiritual&#8212;where He dwells among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh.</span>--See <a href="/1_kings/9-24.htm" title="But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.">1Kings 9:24</a>, which is much briefer than the present notice.

The valley of Tyropeum lay between the temple on the eastern hill and Solomon's palace, which was on the western side of it.
