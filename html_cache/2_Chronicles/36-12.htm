His actions are described as evil, indicating a departure from the covenantal laws and practices that were expected of the kings of Judah. The "sight of the LORD" emphasizes God's omniscience and moral authority, suggesting that Zedekiah's actions were not just politically or socially wrong, but spiritually offensive. This aligns with the Deuteronomic history, where kings are often evaluated based on their faithfulness to God. The phrase echoes the recurring theme in the books of Kings and Chronicles, where the moral and spiritual failures of leaders lead to national decline.<p><b>and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet</b><br>Jeremiah was a major prophet during the time of Zedekiah, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance. The failure to humble oneself before a prophet signifies a rejection of God's word, as prophets were considered God's mouthpieces. This lack of humility is a significant spiritual failing, as humility before God and His messengers is a recurring biblical theme (e.g., <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). Jeremiah's prophecies included warnings about the impending Babylonian exile, and Zedekiah's refusal to heed these warnings contributed to the fall of Jerusalem. This phrase highlights the importance of listening to and respecting God's appointed messengers.<p><b>who spoke for the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine authority behind Jeremiah's messages. Prophets in the Old Testament were chosen by God to deliver His words to the people, often calling them back to faithfulness and warning of consequences for disobedience. Jeremiah's role as a spokesperson for the LORD is crucial, as it legitimizes his prophecies and warnings. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative where God consistently communicates with His people through prophets (e.g., Moses, Elijah, Isaiah). This divine communication is a testament to God's desire for relationship and guidance for His people, despite their frequent rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned from 597 to 586 BC.
