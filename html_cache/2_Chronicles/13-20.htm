Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, had initially established a strong rule after the division of the united monarchy. However, his reign was marked by idolatry and rebellion against God's commandments, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>, where he set up golden calves for worship. The loss of power during Abijah's reign signifies a divine judgment against Jeroboam's apostasy. Abijah's victory, as recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-13.htm">2 Chronicles 13:13-18</a>, was attributed to his reliance on the LORD, contrasting with Jeroboam's reliance on his own strength and false gods.<p><b>and the LORD struck him down</b><br>This phrase indicates divine intervention in the fate of Jeroboam. The LORD's action against Jeroboam serves as a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Ahijah the Shilonite in <a href="/1_kings/14-7.htm">1 Kings 14:7-16</a>, where it was foretold that Jeroboam's house would suffer because of his sins. The striking down of Jeroboam underscores the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and justice, where He actively opposes those who lead His people into idolatry and disobedience. This divine judgment serves as a warning to future leaders about the consequences of turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>and he died</b><br>The death of Jeroboam marks the end of his reign and the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Israel. His death, as a result of divine judgment, emphasizes the transient nature of earthly power and the ultimate authority of God over life and death. This event also sets the stage for the continued struggle between the northern and southern kingdoms, highlighting the ongoing consequences of the division of Israel. The narrative of Jeroboam's demise serves as a reminder of the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, that there is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The expressions of the text cannot mean, as Z&#8221;ckler suggests, "visited him with misfortune till his death." His death is regarded as a judicial visitation (compare the use of the same Hebrew phrase, <a href="/1_samuel/25-38.htm" title="And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.">1Samuel 25:38</a>). The verse, then, states that during the rest of Abijah's reign Jeroboam remained powerless to injure his neighbour; and that the circumstances of his death were such that men recognised in them "the finger of God." It is not likely that the reference is to the event of <a href="/2_chronicles/13-15.htm" title="Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.">2Chronicles 13:15</a> (Bertheau), nor to the death of his son (<a href="/context/1_kings/14-1.htm" title="At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.">1Kings 14:1-8</a>), as Keil supposes. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord struck him; and he died</span>.
