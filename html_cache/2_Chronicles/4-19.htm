This clause draws attention to the completeness of Solomon&#8217;s obedience to the divine blueprint first given to David (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Every item already listed in 2 Chronicles chapters 3&#8211;4&#8212;the bronze pillars, basins, lampstands, and so on&#8212;was fashioned because &#8220;the house of the LORD is to be exceedingly magnificent&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>). The verse reminds us that God deserves meticulous, wholehearted worship.<p>&#8226; By attributing all of the work to Solomon, the text underscores covenant faithfulness: the promise of <a href="/1_kings/6-12.htm">1 Kings 6:12-13</a> is being fulfilled&#8212;God would dwell among His people when they walked in His statutes.<p>&#8226; Application: just as every furnishing served a purpose in the Temple, every believer is &#8220;a living stone&#8221; fitted into God&#8217;s spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), called to serve according to the pattern revealed in Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the golden altar;</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a> first describes this altar of incense&#8212;gold-covered acacia, small yet precious, placed directly before the veil. Its continual fragrance symbolized Israel&#8217;s prayers rising to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Under the new covenant, the imagery finds fulfillment in Christ, our greater High Priest, who &#8220;always lives to intercede for us&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a> shows golden-altar incense mingling with &#8220;the prayers of the saints.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Gold throughout Scripture denotes royalty and divinity (<a href="/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>). By making this altar of pure gold, Solomon pointed to the holiness of approaching God&#8212;no expiation without intercession.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: God still desires heartfelt, continual prayer from His people (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>); the golden altar invites believers to draw near with reverence and confidence (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the tables on which was placed the Bread of the Presence;</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23-30</a> commands a table overlaid with gold to hold &#8220;twelve loaves&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>)&#8212;one for each tribe&#8212;testifying that the whole nation lived before God&#8217;s face. Solomon evidently made multiple tables (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">2 Chronicles 4:8</a>), emphasizing abundance and shared fellowship.<p>&#8226; The bread symbolized covenant provision and continual communion; priests ate it &#8220;in a holy place&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>), illustrating that life and sustenance come from the Lord.<p>&#8226; Jesus deepens the theme: &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). In Him, the promise of God&#8217;s abiding presence becomes personal and eternal (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the Bread of the Presence foreshadows the Lord&#8217;s Supper, where we &#8220;proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death until He comes&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>) and anticipate the marriage supper of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/4-19.htm">2 Chronicles 4:19</a> highlights three specific furnishings that complete Solomon&#8217;s Temple: the golden altar of incense and the tables for the Bread of the Presence, all crafted exactly as God required. Together they declare that worship involves (1) total obedience to God&#8217;s revealed pattern, (2) ceaseless prayer rising through an intercessor, and (3) continual fellowship and provision in God&#8217;s presence. The verse ultimately points forward to Jesus Christ&#8212;our true Temple, Intercessor, and Bread of Life&#8212;who perfectly fulfills every symbol and invites us into wholehearted, reverent, and grateful worship today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(<span class= "ital">c</span>) <span class= "bld">CATALOGUE OF OBJECTS IN GOLD--CONCLUSION</span><p>(2Ch 4:19 -2Ch_5:1). <a href="/context/1_kings/7-48.htm" title="And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the show bread was,">1Kings 7:48-50</a>.<p>The narrative still coincides in the main with that of Kings, allowing for one or two remarkable alterations.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">For the house.</span>--<span class= "ital">In the houses</span> (without proposition, comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/4-11.htm" title="And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins.
