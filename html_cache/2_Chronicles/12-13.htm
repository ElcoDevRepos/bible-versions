His reign marked the beginning of the divided kingdom, as the ten northern tribes broke away to form Israel under Jeroboam. Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, remained the center of Rehoboam's rule. The phrase "established himself" suggests a period of consolidation and securing his position, despite the initial rebellion and loss of the northern tribes.<p><b>He was forty-one years old when he became king,</b><br>Rehoboam's age at ascension indicates a level of maturity and experience, yet his early decisions, particularly his harsh response to the people's request for lighter burdens, led to the division of the kingdom. His age contrasts with the youthful inexperience often associated with poor leadership decisions, highlighting the complexity of his character and reign.<p><b>and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,</b><br>Rehoboam's seventeen-year reign was marked by conflict and instability, including invasions by Egypt under Pharaoh Shishak. Despite these challenges, he maintained control over Judah and Benjamin. The duration of his reign reflects a period of relative stability in Jerusalem, even as the kingdom faced external threats and internal strife.<p><b>the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name.</b><br>Jerusalem holds a special place in biblical history as the city chosen by God for His temple, symbolizing His presence among His people. This divine selection underscores the city's spiritual significance and the centrality of worship in the life of Israel. The temple in Jerusalem was a focal point for the Israelites, representing God's covenant and His dwelling among them.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Naamah the Ammonite.</b><br>Naamah's identity as an Ammonite highlights the complex intermarriages within the royal family, which sometimes led to the introduction of foreign influences and idolatry. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel. Her presence in the royal lineage reflects the broader cultural and political interactions between Israel and its neighbors, as well as the potential for religious syncretism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, known for his role in the division of the united kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city chosen by God to place His Name, serving as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/naamah_the_ammonite.htm">Naamah the Ammonite</a></b><br>Rehoboam's mother, highlighting the influence of foreign alliances and marriages in Israel's history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_choice.htm">The LORD's Choice</a></b><br>God's selection of Jerusalem as the city for His Name, emphasizing divine sovereignty and purpose.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam's_reign.htm">Rehoboam's Reign</a></b><br>His reign lasted seventeen years, marked by challenges and the need for strengthening his position.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty_and_human_leadership.htm">Divine Sovereignty and Human Leadership</a></b><br>Recognize that God&#8217;s choice of Jerusalem reflects His sovereign will and purpose.

Possibly, considering the words of <a href="/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12, 17</a>, this may indicate that Rehoboam was brought down to thinking almost more of the safety of Jerusalem and himself than of the kingdom in its length and breadth. <span class="cmt_word">One and forty years old</span> (see our note, <a href="/2_chronicles/10-8.htm">2 Chronicles 10:8</a>, towards the end, and compare our <a href="/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>, as well as the parallel places, <a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a> and 1 Kings 14:21). It cannot be held as conclusively shown that the age of forty-one is incorrect. <span class="cmt_word">An Ammonitess</span> (see <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-9</a>). Rehoboam's mother's name and nationality are noted also, and twice in the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21, 31</a>). Naamah was possibly the daughter of Nahash (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-1.htm">1 Chronicles 19:1-20:3</a>). The briefness but decidedness of the notifications made as to this mother of Rehoboam leaves us without doubt that there is not lacking significance in them. Schulz (in his ' Scholia in Ver. Test.,' vol. 3.) says the reason is "quia ca filio idololatriae ansam dedisse videtur;" Keil and Bertheau think that, though there was evidence of this in the case of the mention of Asa's mother (<a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), the explanation here is that Naamah "appears" to have had, as queen-mother, considerable influence in the government. They do not specify where they find this to "appear" with any marked plainness. It is quite true that, in the successive accounts of the Jewish kings, the name of each mother is mentioned (<a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-42.htm">1 Kings 22:42</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-32.htm">2 Chronicles 20:32</a>, etc.). We should say it is like the book, so Divine and human, called the Bible, to do so far-seeing and far-reaching a thing as to give the mother's name; and practically to say that Solomon and Naamah were (in special sense for Judah) a repetition of Adam and Eve. How far Judah and her line of kings may have correctly said, <span class="accented">they</span> were answerable for "death and all our woe," the sacred historians say (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4, 9-11, 14, 23, 26, 31, 33, 36</a>;
