He is known for his military campaigns in the Levant, which included the battle of Megiddo against King Josiah of Judah. His involvement in Judah's affairs highlights the geopolitical tensions of the time, as Egypt sought to exert influence over the region amidst the decline of Assyrian power and the rise of Babylon.<p><b>made Eliakim brother of Jehoahaz king over Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>Eliakim was the son of Josiah and the brother of Jehoahaz. After Jehoahaz's brief reign, Neco deposed him and installed Eliakim as a puppet king, renaming him Jehoiakim. This act demonstrates Egypt's control over Judah during this period, as foreign powers often installed rulers who would be loyal to them. The mention of both Judah and Jerusalem emphasizes the centrality of Jerusalem as the political and religious heart of the kingdom.<p><b>and he changed Eliakim&#8217;s name to Jehoiakim</b><br>The changing of Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim by Neco is significant. In the ancient Near East, renaming was a sign of authority and control, often symbolizing a new allegiance or destiny. The name Jehoiakim means "Yahweh raises up," which may have been intended to legitimize his rule in the eyes of the people, despite his appointment by a foreign power. This act of renaming is reminiscent of other biblical instances where names are changed to reflect new roles or divine purposes.<p><b>But Neco took Eliakim&#8217;s brother Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt</b><br>Jehoahaz, also known as Shallum, was taken captive by Neco after a reign of only three months. This removal to Egypt fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33-34</a>, where it was foretold that Jehoahaz would not return to Judah. His captivity in Egypt is a reminder of the consequences of political alliances and the shifting power dynamics of the region. It also serves as a foreshadowing of the later Babylonian exile, where the people of Judah would again be taken from their land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_egypt.htm">King of Egypt (Necho II)</a></b><br>Pharaoh Necho II was the ruler of Egypt who exerted influence over Judah during this period.

Neco&#8217;s actions, therefore, are not merely political moves but part of God&#8217;s unfolding judgment on Judah for persistent disobedience (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>made Eliakim brother of Jehoahaz king over Judah and Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; By deposing Jehoahaz after only three months on the throne (<a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31&#8211;33</a>), Neco installs Eliakim as a vassal king.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;over Judah and Jerusalem&#8221; reminds us that God&#8217;s covenant people and holy city remain in view. Yet their earthly kingship is now subject to foreign dominance&#8212;a sign of covenant curses foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah mourns this loss of true autonomy: &#8220;Weep not for the dead king, but weep bitterly for him who goes away, for he will never return&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a>), underscoring the sorrow tied to Jehoahaz&#8217;s removal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he changed Eliakim&#8217;s name to Jehoiakim</b><p>&#8226; Renaming is an assertion of authority. Just as Pharaoh renamed Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>) and Babylon renamed Daniel and his friends (<a href="/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>), Neco brands Eliakim with a new identity to signal ownership.<p>&#8226; The new name, Jehoiakim (&#8220;Yahweh raises up&#8221;), is ironically bestowed by a pagan king. It points to the tension between divine sovereignty and human manipulation: the Lord alone truly &#8220;raises up&#8221; rulers (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>), even when foreign powers think they hold the reins.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Neco took Eliakim&#8217;s brother Jehoahaz</b><p>&#8226; Jehoahaz, despite being the people&#8217;s choice (<a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>), is seized, bound (<a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>), and effectively removed from Judah&#8217;s future.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel later pictures a captured lion cub dragged to Egypt (<a href="/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3&#8211;4</a>), an apt poetic depiction of Jehoahaz&#8217;s fate.

What was once Israel&#8217;s house of bondage again becomes a place of judgment.<p>&#8226; This removal foreshadows the larger Babylonian exile soon to come (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17&#8211;20</a>).

Jehoahaz is exiled, Judah&#8217;s independence is shattered, and the covenant curses God had long warned now unfold in earnest. The verse reminds us that no earthly power can thwart God&#8217;s righteous judgments; He directs history, disciplines His people, and prepares the stage for ultimate redemption through the promised Messiah, the true and everlasting King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And the king of Egypt made Eliakim.</span>--The verse agrees with <a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.">2Kings 23:34</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Carried</span> <span class= "bld">him to Egypt.</span>--<span class= "ital">Made him come.</span> Kings, "and he came to Egypt, and died there."
