His turning away is a pivotal moment, reflecting a common theme in the Old Testament where leaders fall into idolatry or disobedience. This turning away often leads to divine judgment or downfall, as seen in the lives of other kings like Saul and Solomon. The phrase underscores the importance of steadfastness in faith and obedience to God.<p><b>a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was not only a political center but also a spiritual one. Conspiracies against kings were not uncommon in the ancient Near East, often arising from political dissatisfaction or divine disfavor. The formation of a conspiracy indicates internal strife and dissatisfaction with Amaziah's rule, possibly due to his military failures or religious apostasy. This reflects the biblical principle that turning away from God can lead to instability and unrest.<p><b>and he fled to Lachish</b><br>Lachish was a significant fortified city in Judah, strategically located and often used as a place of refuge. Archaeological excavations have revealed its importance and strength as a military outpost. Amaziah's flight to Lachish suggests he sought safety and support away from the political turmoil in Jerusalem. This action mirrors other biblical figures who sought refuge in fortified cities during times of crisis.<p><b>But men were sent after him to Lachish</b><br>The sending of men to pursue Amaziah indicates the determination of the conspirators to eliminate him as a threat. This pursuit reflects the seriousness of the conspiracy and the lengths to which his enemies would go to ensure his removal. It also highlights the lack of loyalty and the political intrigue that characterized the period.<p><b>and they killed him there</b><br>The assassination of Amaziah in Lachish marks the tragic end of his reign. Such violent ends were not uncommon for kings who fell out of favor, either with God or their subjects. This event serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the fragility of human power. It also foreshadows the ultimate justice and sovereignty of God, who raises and deposes leaders according to His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the LORD but later turned away from Him, leading to his downfall.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where the conspiracy against Amaziah was formed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lachish.htm">Lachish</a></b><br>A fortified city in Judah where Amaziah fled to escape the conspiracy but was ultimately killed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/conspiracy.htm">Conspiracy</a></b><br>A plot formed by Amaziah's own people due to his apostasy and failure as a leader.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_sent_to_lachish.htm">Men sent to Lachish</a></b><br>The individuals who pursued and executed Amaziah, fulfilling the conspiracy against him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_apostasy.htm">The Danger of Apostasy</a></b><br>Amaziah's life warns us of the dangers of turning away from God.

The king&#8217;s own choice to abandon covenant loyalty set everything in motion (2 Chron 25:14-16).<p>- Earlier he had imported the gods of Edom, bowed to them, and even &#8220;burned sacrifices to them&#8221; (25:14).<p>- A prophet warned, &#8220;Why have you sought the gods of a people who could not deliver their own people?&#8221; (25:15). Amaziah refused to listen.<p>- The principle is repeated throughout Scripture: turning from the LORD opens the door to disaster (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-17.htm">Deuteronomy 30:17-18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9-11</a>; 2 Chron 15:2).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem</b><p>With his spiritual moorings gone, his political support crumbled.

Lachish, a fortified city about 25 miles southwest of Jerusalem, was famous for strong walls (<a href="/joshua/10-31.htm">Joshua 10:31-32</a>). He put his confidence in stone ramparts rather than the living God.<p>- Micah later called Lachish &#8220;the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion&#8221; because Judah trusted its horses and chariots (<a href="/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a>).<p>- <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> contrasts such misplaced trust: &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But men were sent after him to Lachish, and they killed him there</b><p>The walls of Lachish could not save a king under divine judgment.
