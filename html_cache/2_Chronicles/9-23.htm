It suggests that his reputation extended beyond Israel to the entire known world. Historically, this could include rulers from neighboring regions such as Egypt, Arabia, and Mesopotamia. The phrase may also be hyperbolic, indicating the vast reach of Solomon's renown. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon renowned (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12-13</a>).<p><b>sought an audience with Solomon</b><br>The desire of these kings to meet Solomon highlights the high regard in which he was held. In ancient times, seeking an audience with a king was a sign of respect and acknowledgment of their authority and wisdom. This also indicates the diplomatic and political significance of Solomon's reign, as foreign leaders sought alliances and counsel.<p><b>to hear the wisdom</b><br>Solomon's wisdom was legendary, attributed to the divine gift from God. His wisdom encompassed not only knowledge and understanding but also practical insights into governance, justice, and human nature. This wisdom is documented in the biblical books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon, which are traditionally attributed to him.<p><b>that God had put in his heart</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of Solomon's wisdom. It was not merely human intelligence but a supernatural endowment from God. This aligns with the biblical narrative in <a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-14</a>, where Solomon asks God for wisdom, and God grants it abundantly. It also serves as a reminder of the source of true wisdom, which is God Himself, as echoed in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>.
