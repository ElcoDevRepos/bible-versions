At twenty-five, Jehoiakim ascended to the throne during a tumultuous period in Judah's history, marked by the decline of Assyrian power and the rise of Babylon. His age suggests a level of maturity, yet his reign would be characterized by political instability and spiritual decline.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years</b><br>Jehoiakim's reign from 609 to 598 BC was marked by shifting allegiances between Egypt and Babylon. Jerusalem, the capital city, was the spiritual and political center of Judah. His eleven-year reign was a time of significant prophetic activity, with prophets like Jeremiah warning of impending judgment due to the nation's unfaithfulness.<p><b>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God</b><br>Jehoiakim's actions were contrary to the covenantal expectations set by God for the kings of Judah. His reign was marked by idolatry, oppression, and disregard for prophetic warnings. This phrase echoes the Deuteronomic history's evaluation of kings, where doing "evil in the sight of the LORD" often led to divine judgment. His reign is a stark contrast to his father Josiah's, who was commended for doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD. Jehoiakim's actions contributed to the eventual Babylonian exile, fulfilling prophecies of judgment against Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The son of Josiah, Jehoiakim became king of Judah at the age of twenty-five.

Comparable kings&#8212;such as Josiah who began at eight (2 Chron 34:1&#8211;2)&#8212;show that godliness is a choice, not an automatic product of age or circumstance.<p>&#8226; His ascent follows Pharaoh Necho&#8217;s removal of his brother Jehoahaz (<a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31&#8211;33</a>). This underscores Judah&#8217;s political weakness and the divine judgment foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>. God&#8217;s people are now subject to foreign manipulation because they have drifted from covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years</b><p>&#8226; Eleven years is long enough to establish direction yet short compared to faithful rulers like Asa or Hezekiah. His reign sits between Egypt&#8217;s fading power and Babylon&#8217;s rise, setting the stage for the exile (2 Chron 36:6; <a href="/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jerusalem, the city where God set His Name (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>), should have been a beacon of righteousness. Instead, Jehoiakim&#8217;s choices accelerate its downfall, fulfilling Jeremiah&#8217;s warnings (<a href="/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; The number of years marks God&#8217;s patience; He allows more than a decade for repentance, echoing <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>. Yet mercy unheeded eventually gives way to discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Evil&#8221; is defined by God&#8217;s standard, not public opinion (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). <a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36&#8211;37</a> specifies heavy taxation and idolatry.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah confronts Jehoiakim repeatedly. He burns the scroll of God&#8217;s word (<a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22&#8211;24</a>), murders the prophet Uriah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20&#8211;23</a>), and exploits the poor (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13&#8211;17</a>).

God&#8217;s assessment is final, contrasting sharply with any temporary political success Jehoiakim might have enjoyed.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;his God&#8221; shows that the covenant relationship still stands; unfaithfulness comes from Judah, not from the Lord (2 Chron 7:14).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5</a> records a king&#8217;s biography in three strokes: his age at accession, the span of his reign, and God&#8217;s verdict on his life. These facts confirm God&#8217;s sovereignty over leadership, His patience during prolonged rebellion, and His righteous judgment when evil persists. Jehoiakim&#8217;s story warns against presuming on God&#8217;s grace and calls every generation to align personal and national life with the Lord&#8217;s unchanging standard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">THE REIGN OF JEHOIAKIM</span> (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/36-5.htm" title="Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.">2Chronicles 36:5-8</a>).
