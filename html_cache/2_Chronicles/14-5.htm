High places were often sites of idolatrous worship, contrary to the centralized worship God commanded at the temple in Jerusalem. This action reflects a return to covenant faithfulness, aligning with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>, where God instructs the Israelites to destroy such places. The removal of these sites indicates a rejection of syncretism and a desire to restore true worship.<p><b>from all the cities of Judah</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive nature of Asa's reforms. By targeting all cities, Asa ensures that the entire nation is unified in worshiping Yahweh alone. This widespread reform contrasts with the partial reforms of other kings, emphasizing Asa's dedication. It also reflects the geographical spread of idolatry, which had permeated throughout Judah, necessitating a thorough cleansing.<p><b>and under him the kingdom was at peace</b><br>The peace experienced under Asa's reign is seen as a divine blessing for his faithfulness and reforms. In the biblical narrative, peace often follows obedience to God's commands, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3-6</a>.

By tearing them down, Asa aligned public worship with God&#8217;s revealed will, much like later reforms under Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3&#8211;4</a>) and Josiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3&#8211;7</a>).

When these altars stood apart from the temple, they usually served idols (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-14.htm">2 Chronicles 30:14</a>). Asa&#8217;s purge targeted even the &#8220;respectable&#8221; forms of idolatry, teaching that partial obedience is no obedience at all (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).

By pushing beyond the capital, Asa avoided the trap of symbolic reform. He proved that authentic faith influences daily life everywhere, not just at the center of power (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). This thoroughness also fulfilled the covenant ideal that the land itself be cleansed from corruption (<a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and under him</b><p>Leadership mattered.

His courage encouraged priests, officials, and citizens to follow suit (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-8.htm">2 Chronicles 15:8</a>). Scripture repeatedly shows how a righteous ruler can steer people toward faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/101-6.htm">Psalm 101:6&#8211;8</a>), while an unrighteous one can lead them astray (<a href="/1_kings/15-26.htm">1 Kings 15:26</a>).
