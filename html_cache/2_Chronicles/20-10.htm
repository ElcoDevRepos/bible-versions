The Ammonites and Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, and had a complex relationship with Israel. Mount Seir is associated with the Edomites, descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. These groups often had contentious interactions with Israel, yet they were spared during Israel's initial conquest of Canaan. This phrase sets the stage for a confrontation, highlighting the irony and tension as these spared nations now threaten Israel.<p><b>whom You did not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This refers to God's specific instructions to the Israelites during their wilderness journey. In <a href="/deuteronomy/2.htm">Deuteronomy 2</a>, God commanded Israel not to harass or provoke war with these nations because He had given their land to the descendants of Lot and Esau. This divine directive underscores God's sovereignty and His plans for different peoples. It also reflects God's faithfulness to His promises, even to those outside the covenant community of Israel.<p><b>So Israel turned away from them and did not destroy them</b><br>Israel's obedience to God's command not to engage these nations is a testament to their faithfulness at that time. This historical decision is significant because it demonstrates Israel's reliance on God's guidance rather than their own military might. The restraint shown by Israel is a reminder of the importance of obedience to God's will, even when it might seem strategically disadvantageous. This act of obedience is now contrasted with the current threat, emphasizing the moral and spiritual dilemma faced by Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is leading the nation in prayer and seeking God's guidance in the face of a vast enemy coalition.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammon,_moab,_and_mount_seir.htm">Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir</a></b><br>These are the nations that have come against Judah.
