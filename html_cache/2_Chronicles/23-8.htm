The Levites, who were responsible for temple duties, and the people of Judah followed Jehoiada's instructions meticulously, highlighting the respect and authority he commanded. This obedience underscores the importance of spiritual leadership and unity in fulfilling God's purposes. The Levites' involvement also emphasizes the significance of the priestly role in guiding and protecting the nation, as seen in other instances like the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah.<p><b>Each of them took his men&#8212;those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty&#8212;</b><br>The reference to the Sabbath indicates the structured and organized nature of temple service, where shifts were meticulously planned. The division of labor among the Levites ensured continuous service and protection of the temple. This system of rotation is reminiscent of the divisions established by King David (1 Chronicles 24), ensuring that the temple was always guarded and that worship was uninterrupted. The mention of the Sabbath also highlights the sacredness of the day, a time set apart for rest and worship, which was central to Jewish life and law.<p><b>for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.</b><br>Jehoiada's decision to retain all divisions, both those coming on and going off duty, was strategic, ensuring maximum manpower for the protection and execution of his plan to crown Joash as king. This move reflects the urgency and importance of the situation, as well as Jehoiada's wisdom in utilizing all available resources. It also illustrates the theme of divine providence and protection, as God used Jehoiada's leadership to preserve the Davidic line, fulfilling His covenant promises. This act of not releasing the divisions can be seen as a type of Christ's unceasing intercession and protection over His people, ensuring their safety and continuity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>A key religious leader who orchestrated the overthrow of Queen Athaliah and the restoration of the rightful king, Joash, to the throne of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/commanders_of_hundreds.htm">Commanders of Hundreds</a></b><br>Military leaders who were responsible for executing Jehoiada's plan.
