This event occurs in the context of a significant religious reform in Judah. The "book" refers to the Torah, likely Deuteronomy, which had been neglected. The rediscovery signifies a turning point, emphasizing the importance of God's Word in guiding the nation. The act of bringing the book to the king highlights the role of intermediaries in communicating divine revelation, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai.<p><b>and reported,</b><br>Shaphan's report to King Josiah underscores the importance of accountability and communication in leadership. In the ancient Near Eastern context, scribes were trusted officials responsible for maintaining records and conveying messages. This moment reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where leaders are accountable for the spiritual and physical well-being of their people, as seen in the parables of Jesus about faithful servants (e.g., <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Your servants are doing all that has been placed in their hands.</b><br>This phrase indicates the diligence and faithfulness of Josiah's servants in carrying out the king's commands. It reflects the biblical theme of faithful service, akin to the parable of the talents, where servants are rewarded for their faithfulness (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>). The phrase also suggests a well-organized administration under Josiah, who was committed to reforming Judah according to God's laws. This commitment to duty and responsibility is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of obedience and stewardship in fulfilling God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaphan.htm">Shaphan</a></b><br>A scribe in the court of King Josiah, responsible for reading the Book of the Law to the king.

Compare Ezra&#8217;s similar zeal in <a href="/ezra/7-10.htm">Ezra 7:10</a> and the Ethiopian official in <a href="/acts/8-28.htm">Acts 8:28&#8211;30</a>, both eager to place Scripture at the center.<p>&#8226; The king, not the scribe, must rule. Yet the king, too, must submit to the Word (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>). Shaphan&#8217;s delivery reminds us that every authority is accountable to God&#8217;s written revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and reported</b><p>&#8226; Shaphan does more than deliver a scroll; he gives a faithful account of temple progress. &#8220;The king&#8217;s scribe&#8221; customarily kept records and conveyed news (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Truthful reporting is a hallmark of godly service. Just as Nathan spoke candidly to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>) and Jehu&#8217;s messenger spoke plainly to Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>), Shaphan demonstrates integrity.<p>&#8226; His words prepare Josiah for the shock of the law&#8217;s contents. Honest communication often paves the way for conviction (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Your servants are doing all that has been placed in their hands.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Shaphan commends the workforce repairing the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-10.htm">2 Chronicles 34:10&#8211;13</a>). Their obedience to orders mirrors the diligence God expects from every servant (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights complete follow-through&#8212;not partial compliance. Compare the faithfulness of the tabernacle craftsmen who &#8220;did everything the LORD commanded&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/39-42.htm">Exodus 39:42&#8211;43</a>) and the Levites who &#8220;worked faithfully&#8221; under Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-12.htm">2 Chronicles 31:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By assuring Josiah that the project is on track, Shaphan implicitly contrasts human faithfulness with the nation&#8217;s previous neglect of God&#8217;s covenant. The workers&#8217; obedience foreshadows the king&#8217;s soon-to-come obedience when he hears the Law (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-19.htm">2 Chronicles 34:19, 31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Shaphan&#8217;s simple errand becomes a turning point for Judah.
