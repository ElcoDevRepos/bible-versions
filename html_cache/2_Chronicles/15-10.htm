Gathering in Jerusalem signifies a unified act of worship and commitment to God, reflecting the importance of the city as a spiritual center. This gathering was likely a large assembly, emphasizing the communal nature of their covenant renewal. The act of gathering in Jerusalem also connects to the idea of pilgrimage, as seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the feasts where Israelites were commanded to appear before the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).<p><b>in the third month</b><br>The third month in the Hebrew calendar is Sivan, which corresponds to late May or early June. This timing is significant as it coincides with the Feast of Weeks (Shavuot), a time of thanksgiving for the harvest and the giving of the Law at Sinai. The choice of this month for the gathering underscores a theme of renewal and recommitment to God's laws and blessings. It also highlights the agricultural cycle, as this was a time of firstfruits, symbolizing new beginnings and dedication.<p><b>of the fifteenth year of Asa&#8217;s reign</b><br>Asa was the king of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid the land of idolatry. The fifteenth year of his reign marks a period of relative peace and stability, allowing for spiritual renewal. Asa's reign is characterized by a return to the worship of Yahweh, and this gathering is part of his broader reform efforts. Historically, Asa's reign is noted for its contrast to the idolatrous practices of neighboring nations and even previous kings of Judah. This period is a fulfillment of the covenant blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to return the people to the worship of Yahweh.

Their gathering meant:<p>&#8226; Collective obedience&#8212;mirroring <a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>, where the LORD commands, &#8220;Assemble the people&#8212;men, women, children, and the foreigners living within your gates&#8212;so they may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Shared encouragement&#8212;<a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a> reminds believers not to give up &#8220;meeting together&#8230;but encouraging one another.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Public covenant renewal&#8212;similar to <a href="/2_chronicles/5-3.htm">2 Chronicles 5:3</a>, when Israel gathered for the dedication of Solomon&#8217;s temple.

By gathering there, they aligned themselves with God&#8217;s appointed center of worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;7</a>). <a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1&#8211;2</a> captures the joy of such a pilgrimage: &#8220;I rejoiced with those who said to me, &#8216;Let us go to the house of the LORD.&#8217; &#8230; Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem.&#8221; Coming to Jerusalem declared both national solidarity and submission to God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the third month</b><p>The third month (Sivan) was harvest time and the season of the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost). <a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a> calls it &#8220;the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labors.&#8221; By assembling then, the people could:<p>&#8226; Present thank offerings from the new grain (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Link material harvest with spiritual renewal&#8212;celebrating God&#8217;s provision while pledging fresh loyalty.<p>The timing signals that covenant commitment and thanksgiving belong together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the fifteenth year</b><p>Fifteen years into Asa&#8217;s reign places this event well after his initial reforms (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2&#8211;5</a>) but early enough for momentum to grow.

The verse underscores unity, obedience to God&#8217;s chosen place, timely celebration of His provision, and the pivotal role of righteous leadership.
