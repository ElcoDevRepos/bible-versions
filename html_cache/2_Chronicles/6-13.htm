Bronze, a durable and valuable metal, was often used in the tabernacle and temple for items associated with worship and sacrifice, symbolizing strength and endurance. This platform was specifically crafted for Solomon's prayer of dedication, highlighting the solemnity and significance of the event.<p><b>five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high</b><br>The dimensions of the platform (approximately 7.5 feet long and wide, and 4.5 feet high) suggest a structure that was both prominent and accessible. The use of specific measurements reflects the biblical emphasis on order and precision, reminiscent of the detailed instructions given for the construction of the tabernacle and temple. The number five often symbolizes grace in biblical numerology, which may underscore the grace of God being sought in Solomon's prayer.<p><b>and had placed it in the middle of the courtyard</b><br>Positioning the platform in the middle of the courtyard ensured that Solomon was visible to the entire assembly of Israel. This central location emphasizes the communal aspect of the dedication, as the temple was to be a place of worship for all the people. The courtyard was a significant area in the temple complex, where the congregation gathered, symbolizing unity and collective worship.<p><b>He stood on it</b><br>Solomon standing on the platform indicates his role as both king and spiritual leader. His position on the platform signifies authority and leadership, as he represents the people before God. This act also reflects the biblical tradition of leaders standing to address the assembly, as seen with Moses and other prophets.<p><b>knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel</b><br>Kneeling is a posture of humility and submission, especially significant for a king. By kneeling, Solomon demonstrates reverence for God and acknowledges his dependence on divine guidance. This act of humility before the entire assembly sets an example for the people, emphasizing that even the king is subject to God's authority.<p><b>spread out his hands toward heaven</b><br>Spreading out hands in prayer is a gesture of openness and supplication, symbolizing a plea for divine intervention and blessing. This posture is common in biblical prayers, indicating a desire to receive from God. It reflects a connection between heaven and earth, as Solomon seeks God's presence and favor upon the newly built temple. This act can also be seen as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity, bridging the gap between God and man.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bronze_platform.htm">Bronze Platform</a></b><br>A specially constructed platform used by Solomon during the dedication of the Temple.

Bronze had long symbolized judgment and endurance (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>), and Solomon chose that durable metal for a public act of worship.<p>- <a href="/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a> parallels the account: &#8220;Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Size: Five by Five by Three Cubits</b><p>- &#8220;Five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high.&#8221; A cubit is roughly 18 inches, so the platform measured about 7&#189; &#215; 7&#189; &#215; 4&#189; feet.<p>- These exact measurements echo the bronze altar Moses was commanded to build: &#8220;You are to make the altar five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar is to be square, and three cubits high&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>).<p>- By matching those dimensions, Solomon visibly connected the dedication of the temple to the wilderness worship of Israel&#8217;s beginnings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Placed in the Middle of the Courtyard</b><p>- &#8220;And had placed it in the middle of the courtyard.&#8221;<p>- Positioning it centrally allowed every worshiper a clear view, underscoring corporate participation (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-9.htm">2 Chronicles 4:9</a> notes the layout of the priestly court).<p>- The central location mirrors God&#8217;s desire to dwell &#8220;in the midst&#8221; of His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Solomon Stood on the Platform</b><p>- &#8220;He stood on it.&#8221; A king normally sat on a throne, but Solomon rises to stand before the Lord.<p>- Standing signifies readiness to serve (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>) and urgency in intercession (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22</a>).<p>- Like Joshua, who said, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>), Solomon publicly commits himself and the nation to covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The King Kneels Before All Israel</b><p>- Next, &#8220;he knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel.&#8221; Royal dignity yields to humble worship.<p>- Kneeling conveys submission (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>) and contrition (<a href="/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5</a>). Even the king bows because God alone is sovereign.<p>- Daniel would later pray on his knees three times a day (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), following this royal example of humility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hands Spread Toward Heaven</b><p>- Finally, Solomon &#8220;spread out his hands toward heaven.&#8221;<p>- This posture of open-handed dependence appears in <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;May the lifting of my hands be like the evening offering&#8221;.<p>- It signals confidence that God hears (<a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>) and invites the nation to look heavenward for mercy (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p>Solomon&#8217;s bronze platform, matching the altar of Moses and set in the temple&#8217;s heart, becomes a visual sermon. The king stands, then kneels, and lifts his hands&#8212;moving from authority to humility to expectancy.
