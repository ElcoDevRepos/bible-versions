It reflects the common biblical practice of blessing God, seen throughout the Psalms and other scriptures (e.g., <a href="/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>). It emphasizes the recognition of God's supreme authority and benevolence.<p><b>who has delighted in you</b><br>The delight of God in Solomon signifies divine favor and approval. This echoes God's pleasure in David, Solomon's father, and His covenant promises to David's lineage (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). It highlights the personal relationship between God and His chosen leaders.<p><b>to set you on His throne</b><br>The throne is described as belonging to God, indicating that Solomon's kingship is a divine appointment. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy, where the king rules as God's representative. It parallels the idea of Jesus Christ as the ultimate King who sits on God's throne (<a href="/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>).<p><b>to be king for the LORD your God</b><br>Solomon's kingship is portrayed as a service to God, emphasizing the responsibility of the king to govern according to God's laws and purposes. This aligns with the biblical principle that leaders are stewards of God's authority (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><b>Because your God loved Israel enough</b><br>God's love for Israel is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, underscoring His covenantal relationship with His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>). This love is unconditional and enduring, forming the basis for His actions and promises towards Israel.<p><b>to establish them forever</b><br>The promise of an everlasting establishment points to the Davidic Covenant, where God promises David's lineage an eternal kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). This foreshadows the eternal reign of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, whose kingdom will have no end (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p><b>He has made you king over them</b><br>Solomon's kingship is seen as a direct result of God's will and purpose. This divine appointment is a fulfillment of God's promise to David and a testament to His faithfulness. It also serves as a type of Christ, the ultimate King appointed by God.<p><b>to carry out justice and righteousness</b><br>Justice and righteousness are central to the biblical understanding of good governance. Solomon's role is to uphold these divine principles, reflecting God's character (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>). This anticipates the perfect justice and righteousness of Christ's reign (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>A prominent and wealthy queen who visited King Solomon to test his wisdom with hard questions.
