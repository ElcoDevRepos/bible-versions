It suggests a time of peace and prosperity, allowing Solomon to focus on religious duties. This period is marked by Solomon's dedication to maintaining the worship practices established by his father, David.<p><b>Solomon offered burnt offerings</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. Solomon's participation in offering these sacrifices highlights his role not only as a king but also as a spiritual leader. This act reflects obedience to the Mosaic Law, which prescribed such offerings (Leviticus 1). It also underscores Solomon's commitment to upholding the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>to the LORD</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the covenant name of God, Yahweh. This emphasizes the personal and covenantal relationship between God and Israel. Solomon's offerings were directed to Yahweh, affirming the exclusive worship of the God of Israel, in contrast to the polytheistic practices of surrounding nations.<p><b>on the altar of the LORD</b><br>The altar was a sacred place for sacrifices, constructed according to divine specifications given to Moses (<a href="/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>). Solomon's use of this altar signifies adherence to God's instructions and the centrality of the temple in Israel's worship. The altar represents a place of meeting between God and His people, where atonement and worship occur.<p><b>he had built</b><br>This refers to Solomon's construction of the temple, a monumental achievement that fulfilled David's desire to build a house for the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-13</a>). Solomon's building of the temple and its altar signifies the establishment of a permanent place for God's presence among His people, fulfilling the promise of a centralized location for worship.<p><b>in front of the portico</b><br>The portico, or porch, was an architectural feature of the temple, serving as an entrance to the holy place. Its mention here indicates the specific location of the altar, emphasizing the order and design of the temple complex. The portico's position highlights the transition from the outer court to the inner sanctum, symbolizing the approach to God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.
