His actions being described as "right in the eyes of the LORD" indicates his adherence to the covenantal laws and practices that were expected of the kings of Judah. This phrase is often used in the Old Testament to denote a king's faithfulness to God, contrasting with those who did evil. Joash's early reign was marked by religious reforms and the restoration of the temple, aligning with the Deuteronomic history's emphasis on covenant fidelity. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of divine approval for those who follow God's commandments, similar to the commendations given to other righteous kings like David and Hezekiah.<p><b>all the days of Jehoiada the priest</b><br>Jehoiada was a high priest who played a crucial role in Joash's life, acting as a mentor and guide. His influence was significant in Joash's early years, ensuring that the king's actions were aligned with God's will. The phrase highlights the importance of godly counsel and leadership, as Jehoiada's presence was instrumental in maintaining Joash's faithfulness. This period of righteousness under Jehoiada's guidance underscores the biblical principle that wise and godly leadership can lead to national and spiritual prosperity. The eventual decline in Joash's faithfulness after Jehoiada's death serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of straying from godly influence, paralleling the warnings found in Proverbs about the importance of wise counsel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash</a></b><br>Joash was the king of Judah who began his reign at a young age.
