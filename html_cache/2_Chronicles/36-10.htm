Jehoiachin, also known as Jeconiah or Coniah, was the king of Judah who reigned for only three months before being deposed.

Babylon, located in modern-day Iraq, was the center of the Babylonian Empire and a place of significant cultural and political influence.<p><b>along with the articles of value from the house of the LORD</b><br>The removal of sacred articles from the temple in Jerusalem symbolizes the desecration and loss of Judah's spiritual and national identity.

Kings gives a full account of the siege and surrender of Jerusalem, and the deportation to Babylon of the king and all his princes and men of war, by "the servants of Nebuchadnezzar."<p><span class= "bld">With the goodly vessels.</span>--<a href="/2_chronicles/32-27.htm" title="And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;">2Chronicles 32:27</a>. "Some of the vessels" had already been carried off (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-7.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.">2Chronicles 36:7</a>). (See <a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm" title="And he carried out there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.">2Kings 24:13</a> and <a href="/context/jeremiah/27-18.htm" title="But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.">Jeremiah 27:18-22</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the year was expired</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the beginning of the new year, in spring (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>). It appears, from <a href="/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27-30</a>, that the captivity of Jehoia-chin, which thus began, lasted thirty-seven years, till <span class="date">B.C. 561</span>, past the end of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, and that he was thenceforward kindly treated by Evil-Merodach. Compare particularly with this verse the parallel in its vers. 10-16. <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah his brother</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not adopting the very generic usage of the terms of relationship, so common in Old Testament language, his <span class="accented">uncle</span>.

Ten years old evidently when Jehoiakim began his reign, he must have been thirteen years younger than his whole brother Je-hoahaz. Zedekiah's name was before Mat-taniah. The account of Zedekiah in the parallel (which see) is very much more full. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the spring,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;li&#7791;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#183;&#7687;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
