His reign is noted in <a href="/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10-25</a>. Amaziah, king of Judah, ruled the southern kingdom. This interaction occurs during a period of division between the two kingdoms, highlighting the ongoing tension and rivalry. The historical context is crucial, as both kings were descendants of David, yet their kingdoms were often at odds. This division is a result of the split after Solomon's reign, as described in <a href="/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>.<p><b>&#8220;A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying,</b><br>The imagery of a thistle and a cedar is symbolic. The thistle represents something small and insignificant, while the cedar symbolizes strength and majesty. Lebanon was known for its mighty cedars, often used in biblical literature to denote power and grandeur (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>). This metaphor illustrates the perceived arrogance of Amaziah, who, despite his recent victory over Edom, is seen as overreaching by challenging Jehoash.<p><b>&#8216;Give your daughter to my son in marriage.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase suggests a proposal of alliance or equality, which was common in ancient Near Eastern politics. Marriages were often used to secure peace or alliances between kingdoms. However, in this context, it is a sarcastic remark, as Jehoash implies that Amaziah's request is presumptuous and unrealistic, given the disparity in their power and status.<p><b>Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle.</b><br>The wild beast represents an unforeseen force or event that disrupts the thistle's plans. This imagery suggests the futility of Amaziah's ambitions and foreshadows his defeat. The use of a wild beast can also be seen as a metaphor for divine intervention or judgment, a common theme in the Old Testament where God uses natural elements or events to fulfill His purposes (<a href="/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5-6</a>).

Amaziah, flush with a lesser victory, overvalues his own strength, like a tiny thistle demanding royal alliance with a towering cedar. Jehoash warns that unchecked arrogance invites swift ruin, symbolized by a wild beast crushing the thistle.
