The measurement of five cubits (approximately 7.5 feet or 2.3 meters) indicates the grandeur and scale of these figures. The cherubim were crafted from olive wood and overlaid with gold, emphasizing their importance and the holiness of the temple. The number five in biblical numerology often represents grace, which may symbolize the grace of God covering His people.<p><b>and touched the wall of the temple</b><br>The placement of the cherubim so that their wings touched the temple walls signifies the encompassing presence of God within the Holy of Holies. This design reflects the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant, where their wings also overshadowed the mercy seat. The touching of the wall suggests a connection between heaven and earth, as the temple was considered the dwelling place of God among His people.<p><b>while its other wing measured five cubits</b><br>The symmetry in the measurements of the cherubim's wings highlights the order and perfection in God's creation and His divine plan. The equal length of the wings suggests balance and harmony, which are key themes in the construction of the temple. This balance can also be seen as a reflection of God's justice and mercy.<p><b>and touched the wing of the first cherub</b><br>The touching of the wings of the two cherubim symbolizes unity and completeness. In the context of the temple, it represents the unity of God's covenant with Israel and His continual presence with them. This imagery is reminiscent of the cherubim in the Garden of Eden, guarding the way to the Tree of Life, and points forward to the unity and reconciliation found in Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the temple and the presence of God with humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem, a task that his father David had prepared for but was not allowed to complete.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings depicted in the temple, symbolizing the presence and majesty of God.

Scripture records the same dimension in <a href="/1_kings/6-24.htm">1 Kings 6:24</a>, underscoring that these measurements were not symbolic approximations but precise instructions delivered to Solomon. By noting the specific length twice, the text highlights:<p>&#8226; The literal scale of the heavenly imagery God wanted inside His earthly house.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s concern for detail, mirroring earlier blueprints such as <a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>, where every tabernacle element was set &#8220;according to the pattern.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The intentional parity between the two cherubim, pointing to God&#8217;s order and symmetry (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>touched the wall of the temple</b><p>One wing stretches all the way to the side wall, showing that the cherubim were not miniature decorations but massive figures anchoring the Most Holy Place (<a href="/1_kings/6-27.htm">1 Kings 6:27</a>). This placement teaches:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s throne room imagery is meant to fill the entire sacred space, reminding worshipers that His presence dominates every corner.<p>&#8226; The wall contact forms a protective canopy&#8212;an echo of <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where cherubim guard Eden&#8217;s entrance, and of <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>, where God&#8217;s wings symbolize shelter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>its other wing measured five cubits</b><p>The repetition of the five-cubit span for the second wing strengthens the idea of perfect balance.
