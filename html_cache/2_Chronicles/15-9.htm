These tribes formed the southern kingdom after the division of Israel following Solomon's reign. Judah and Benjamin were closely aligned, with Jerusalem located within Judah's territory. The assembly signifies a call to unity and renewal of covenant faithfulness, reflecting Asa's reforms and commitment to God.<p><b>along with those from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had settled among them</b><br>Ephraim and Manasseh were part of the northern kingdom of Israel, while Simeon was originally part of the southern kingdom but had territories within Judah. The mention of these tribes indicates a movement of people from the northern kingdom to the south, likely due to Asa's religious reforms and the spiritual decline in the north under Jeroboam's idolatry. This migration underscores the division within Israel and the desire for true worship.<p><b>for great numbers had come over to him from Israel</b><br>This influx of people from Israel to Judah highlights the impact of Asa's leadership and the spiritual hunger among the Israelites. It reflects a significant shift, as many sought refuge in a kingdom where the worship of Yahweh was being restored. This movement can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to preserve a remnant faithful to Him.<p><b>when they saw that the LORD his God was with him</b><br>The presence of God with Asa was evident through his victories and reforms, drawing people to him. This phrase emphasizes the biblical theme that God's favor and presence are powerful testimonies to others. It also foreshadows the ultimate presence of God with His people through Jesus Christ, who draws all nations to Himself.

The verse illustrates how faithful leadership, empowered by God, unifies God&#8217;s people, breaks down human divisions, and spreads covenant blessing. When God&#8217;s presence is unmistakable, multitudes are willing to leave comfort zones, align with truth, and participate in renewed worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The strangers</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the non-Judaeans; members of the northern kingdom. A similar accession to the southern kingdom had taken place under Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-16.htm" title="And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers.">2Chronicles 11:16</a>); and another yet is related in the reign of Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-11.htm" title="Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 30:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-18.htm" title="For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one">2Chronicles 30:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And out of Simeon.</span>--This tribe is again mentioned along with Ephraim and Manasseh in <a href="/2_chronicles/34-6.htm" title="And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.">2Chronicles 34:6</a>, although its territory lay "within the inheritance of the children of Judah" (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm" title="And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.">Joshua 19:1</a>). Perhaps a portion of the tribe had migrated northward (comp. Judges 18), and some of these now settled again in Judah. <a href="/genesis/49-7.htm" title="Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.">Genesis 49:7</a> speaks of Simeon as "divided in Jacob, and scattered in Israel." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He gathered</span>. As the following verses go on to show, Ass wisely gathered all beneath his sway, with a view to sacrifice and to record anew hallowed resolve as a nation. <span class="cmt_word">The strangers</span>. It is a significant comment on the estranging effect of religious schism (for the schism was religious even beyond what it was <span class="accented">national</span>) that so comparatively soon these of the tribes of Israel should have become called "strangers" by the side of <span class="cmt_word">Judah and Benjamin. They fell to him... in abundance</span>. Another significant comment on the sameness of human nature in all time; the weak and the multitude will see, learn, do duty, less under pure conviction of right, than under the strong commanding influence of observation of where and with whom success goes, even if that success necessitate the owning of the Divine blessing as its cause (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-16.htm">2 Chronicles 11:16</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19</a>). It should be noted, not for the sake of satire of human nature, but for the inculcation of the infinite importance of godly influence and example. <span class="cmt_word">Out of Simeon</span> (see also <a href="/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>). The "lines" of the Simeonites fell to them originally (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>) within Judah. The difficulty suggested by their being called, apparently, "strangers," and being certainly classed with the comers from "Ephraim and Manasseh," may be variously overcome, either by supposing that they had become more estranged from Judah in religious position than it was possible to them to have become in merely geographical; or that they had in some degree outgrown their own proper habitat, and had to some extent colonized a more northerly region (<a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>); or that, though, indeed, our compiler's composition undoubtedly places the Simeonites summoned, among <span class="accented">the strangers</span>, through mentioning them after Ephraim and Manasseh, yet this location of their name be held accidental, rather than due to special design. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he assembled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;b&#333;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
