The land, Canaan, was a central part of God's covenant with Israel, symbolizing His faithfulness and provision. Historically, this settlement began with Joshua's conquest and continued through the period of the Judges and the establishment of the monarchy. The land was not just a physical territory but a place where God's people were to live in obedience and worship.<p><b>and have built in it a sanctuary for Your Name,</b><br>The sanctuary mentioned is the Temple in Jerusalem, constructed by Solomon (1 Kings 6). This was a fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for God's Name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). The Temple was the central place of worship, symbolizing God's presence among His people. It was a place for sacrifices, prayer, and the annual feasts, serving as a focal point for Israel's religious life. The phrase "for Your Name" emphasizes the Temple's purpose to honor and glorify God, reflecting the biblical theme that God's name represents His character and authority.<p><b>saying,</b><br>This introduces a quotation or declaration, often used in biblical texts to highlight a significant statement or prayer. In this context, it likely refers to the dedication of the Temple, where Solomon prayed for God's presence and protection (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-20.htm">2 Chronicles 6:20-21</a>). This invocation underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the people call upon God to fulfill His promises and demonstrate His faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the nation in seeking God's help against a vast enemy army.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where the events of <a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a> take place.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where the temple was built and where Jehoshaphat gathered the people to seek the Lord.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The sanctuary built for the Name of the Lord, a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_of_judah.htm">The Assembly of Judah</a></b><br>The gathering of the people of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple to seek God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_sacred_spaces.htm">The Importance of Sacred Spaces</a></b><br>The temple was a physical representation of God's presence.
