Prophets served as God's mouthpieces, delivering messages of repentance and hope. This reflects God's enduring patience and desire for His people to return to Him, despite their repeated disobedience. Prophets like Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah, and Jeremiah were pivotal in this role, often facing persecution for their messages.<p><b>to bring the people back to Him</b><br>The primary mission of the prophets was to lead the people back to a covenant relationship with God. This phrase underscores the theme of repentance and restoration that is central to the prophetic ministry. The call to return to God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a> and <a href="/hosea/14.htm">Hosea 14:1-2</a>, emphasizing God's willingness to forgive and restore those who turn back to Him.<p><b>and to testify against them</b><br>Prophets not only called for repentance but also testified against the people's sins and idolatry. This legal language suggests a courtroom setting where the prophets act as witnesses against the people's unfaithfulness. This is seen in the ministry of prophets like Jeremiah, who was tasked with declaring the people's sins and the impending judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>). The prophets' testimonies were often met with resistance and hostility.<p><b>but they would not listen</b><br>This phrase highlights the persistent rebellion and hardness of heart among the people. Despite the clear warnings and calls to repentance, the people often chose to ignore the prophets. This pattern of disobedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in the narratives of the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 32) and the repeated cycles of sin in the Book of Judges. The refusal to listen ultimately led to judgment and exile, as prophesied by figures like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers sent by God to call the people of Judah back to Him.

After King Joash and Judah turned from repairing the temple to worshiping idols (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17&#8211;18</a>), God could have abandoned them.<p>- Instead, He stepped in to intervene, illustrating the thread of mercy that runs through Scripture (<a href="/psalms/106-44.htm">Psalm 106:44&#8211;45</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26&#8211;31</a>).<p>- This contrast reminds us that while human unfaithfulness is real, God&#8217;s covenant compassion is even more persistent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD sent prophets</b><p>- Yahweh Himself initiated the rescue mission, commissioning messengers such as Zechariah son of Jehoiada (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>).<p>- Throughout history God has used prophets to announce His will (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>), speak by His Spirit (<a href="/hosea/12-10.htm">Hosea 12:10</a>), and lay the foundation for the ultimate revelation in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>- Sending prophets proves that God is not silent when His people drift; He acts, speaks, warns, and pleads.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to bring the people back to Him</b><p>- The goal was restoration, not mere reprimand.<p>&#8226; Repentance carries the promise of healing and renewal (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God takes &#8220;no pleasure in the death of the wicked&#8221; but delights when they &#8220;turn and live&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>; 33:11).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Return to Me, and I will return to you,&#8221; He repeats (<a href="/malachi/3-7.htm">Malachi 3:7</a>).<p>- This reveals the shepherd-heart of God, echoed later in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>: He is &#8220;patient&#8230; not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to testify against them</b><p>- Love includes honest confrontation. Prophets served as covenant witnesses, spelling out the charges: idolatry, injustice, forgetfulness of God.<p>- Scripture balances invitation with indictment (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>- Paul models the same pattern when he reasons &#8220;about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come&#8221; (<a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>).<p>- Such testimony is designed to awaken conscience before consequences fall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they would not listen</b><p>- Judah&#8217;s refusal was willful, not accidental. They &#8220;stiffened their necks&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15&#8211;16</a>), just as earlier generations had done (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>- Persistent deafness to God&#8217;s voice hardens the heart (<a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11&#8211;12</a>) and ultimately invites judgment (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15&#8211;19</a>).<p>- The tragedy here is not God&#8217;s silence but the people&#8217;s stubbornness in the face of repeated mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/24-19.htm">2 Chronicles 24:19</a> highlights the gracious pattern of God&#8217;s dealings with His people. Even after blatant disobedience, He intervenes&#8212;sending prophets, calling for repentance, presenting clear testimony&#8212;because His desire is always restoration. Yet the verse also exposes human responsibility: rejecting God&#8217;s word closes the door to blessing and opens the door to discipline. The passage therefore stands as both comfort&#8212;God relentlessly pursues His people&#8212;and caution&#8212;persistent refusal invites inevitable consequences.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Yet.</span>--<span class= "ital">And.</span><p><span class= "bld">To them.</span>--<span class= "ital">Among them.</span><p><span class= "bld">And they testified against them.</span>--<span class= "ital">Solemnly besought them, exhorted them in the name of God</span> (<a href="/exodus/20-21.htm" title="And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.">Exodus 20:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm" title="Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn you from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.">2Kings 17:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">But they would.</span><span class= "ital">--And they did.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophets</span>.
