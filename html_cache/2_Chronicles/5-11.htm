This act of consecration underscores the holiness required to approach God, reflecting the broader biblical theme of sanctification. The mention of "regardless of their divisions" highlights the unity among the priests, transcending their usual divisions into 24 courses as established by King David (1 Chronicles 24). This unity is significant in the context of the temple dedication, symbolizing the collective worship and service to God. The act of consecration also prefigures the ultimate consecration found in Jesus Christ, who sanctifies believers (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>And when the priests came out of the Holy Place,</b><br>The Holy Place was a sacred area within the temple, distinct from the Most Holy Place, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. The priests' exit from the Holy Place indicates the completion of their duties within this sacred space, possibly involving the placement of the Ark in the Most Holy Place (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7</a>). This movement signifies a transition from preparation to the public act of worship and dedication. The Holy Place itself is a type of Christ, who is the true temple and mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). The priests' role in the temple foreshadows the priesthood of all believers, who are called to serve and worship God in spirit and truth (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The priests were the Levitical priests who served in the temple.

No one opted out, underscoring how corporate worship demands full participation. See <a href="/exodus/19-22.htm">Exodus 19:22</a>, where the priests at Sinai likewise had to approach the LORD together; and compare with <a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>, where &#8220;they were all together in one place&#8221; before the Spirit was poured out. God habitually moves when His people gather as one.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had consecrated themselves</b><p>Consecration is the act of setting oneself apart for God&#8217;s service. In the Old Testament, that meant ceremonial washing, wearing prescribed garments, and abstaining from anything defiling (<a href="/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-34.htm">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>). The verse assures us the priests didn&#8217;t shortcut that process. For believers today, the call is equally literal&#8212;though expressed morally rather than ceremonially: &#8220;Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). First Peter 2:5 says we are &#8220;a holy priesthood&#8221; who must likewise be set apart before we minister.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>regardless of their divisions</b><p>Ordinarily, priestly &#8220;divisions&#8221; (<a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>) served on a rotating schedule. Here, divisions fade into the background; every group turns up at once. The temple dedication is too significant for shifts and rotations. It is an exceptional, all-hands-on-deck moment, echoing <a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>: &#8220;How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in harmony.&#8221; Denominational or departmental lines should disappear whenever God&#8217;s glory is about to fill the house (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when the priests came out of the Holy Place</b><p>Having completed their duties&#8212;placing the ark, arranging the furnishings&#8212;they exit so the rest of Israel can see what happens next. Immediately the Levite singers and musicians take up praise (vv. 12&#8211;13), and &#8220;the glory of the LORD filled the house.&#8221; This sequence reminds us that human preparation precedes divine manifestation. Moses experienced the same pattern in <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>&#8212;once the tabernacle was fully arranged, &#8220;the cloud covered the tent&#8230;and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.&#8221; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a> invites every believer, cleansed by Christ, to &#8220;enter the Most Holy Place&#8221; and then step out to testify of His glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/5-11.htm">2 Chronicles 5:11</a> captures a snapshot of complete, unified, and consecrated priestly service. Every priest shows up, every heart is purified, every dividing line is set aside, and every task inside the Holy Place is finished. Only then does God&#8217;s tangible presence flood the temple. The verse challenges us to pursue the same readiness: full attendance, personal holiness, genuine unity, and faithful completion of our assigned tasks&#8212;knowing that when we prepare the house, God delights to fill it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">For all the priests.</span>--From this point to "for his mercy endureth for ever," <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm" title="It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;">2Chronicles 5:13</a>, the narrative is peculiar to the chronicler.
