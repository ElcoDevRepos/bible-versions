The "house" refers to the Temple, which would replace the Tabernacle as the dwelling place of God's presence. The "Name of the LORD" signifies God's authority and character, emphasizing that the Temple is dedicated to Him alone. This construction fulfills the promise made to David in <a href="/1_chronicles/17-11.htm">1 Chronicles 17:11-12</a>, where God assures David that his son will build a house for His Name.<p><b>to dedicate to Him for burning fragrant incense before Him</b><br>The burning of incense symbolizes prayers ascending to God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>. Incense was a significant part of the Temple rituals, representing the people's worship and intercession. The use of "fragrant" indicates the pleasing nature of sincere worship to God. The altar of incense was placed in the Holy Place, just before the veil leading to the Holy of Holies, signifying the closeness of prayer to God's presence.<p><b>for displaying the showbread continuously</b><br>The showbread, also known as the "bread of the Presence," consisted of twelve loaves representing the twelve tribes of Israel, placed on a table in the Holy Place. This continuous display signifies God's provision and sustenance for His people, as well as their covenant relationship with Him. The showbread is a type of Christ, who is the "Bread of Life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), providing spiritual nourishment to believers.<p><b>and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The daily offerings, as prescribed in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>, demonstrate the need for continual atonement and the people's ongoing relationship with God. These offerings foreshadow the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>as well as on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts of the LORD our God</b><br>These specific times of worship highlight the rhythm of Israel's religious calendar, which included weekly Sabbaths, monthly New Moon celebrations, and annual feasts such as Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. Each occasion provided an opportunity for communal worship and remembrance of God's acts in history. The feasts often pointed to future fulfillment in Christ, such as Passover prefiguring His sacrificial death (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><b>This is ordained for Israel forever</b><br>The phrase underscores the perpetual nature of these commands, reflecting God's unchanging covenant with Israel. While the physical Temple and its rituals were specific to the Old Covenant, they find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ and the New Covenant. The eternal principles of worship, atonement, and God's presence continue through the Church, the spiritual temple (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), and the believer's life in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is speaking in this verse.

This sweet incense, compounded of the four ingredients stacte, onycha, galbanum, pure frankincense, was to be burnt morning and evening, at the time of the morning and evening sacrifices on the altar made of shittim wood, overlaid with gold, which stood in the holy place facing the ark. with the table of shewbread on the one hand, and the golden candlestick on the other. While the act of atonement was set forth by the offering of the victim on the brazen altar in the outer court, the ascending, acceptable, and accepted prayer and aspiration of the congregation were expressed by the sweet incense-burning. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="cmt_word">The continual</span> <span class="cmt_word">shew-bread</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>). The elementary meaning of the word here rendered "shewbread" is "a ranging in order," whether the "order" might be, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that of an army in battle array (<a href="/1_samuel/4-16.htm">1 Samuel 4:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-8.htm">1 Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-48.htm">2 Samuel 22:48</a>), or of the lamps of the holy candlestick (<a href="/exodus/39-37.htm">Exodus 39:37</a>), or of pilings of wood to be burnt on the altar (<a href="/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>), or of cakes of bread, as presumably 'here and in some parallel passages (<a href="/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>). For the table which was to carry these cakes, see <a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23-30</a>; <a href="/exodus/37-10.htm">Exodus 37:10-16</a>; the last verse of the former passage speaking of the shewbread under the name <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. (For the position of the table, see <a href="/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>.) The word employed in the text is first used to express the piles of cakes, called in our Authorized Version shewbread in <a href="/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6, 7</a>; then <a href="/1_chronicles/9-32.htm">1 Chronicles 9:32</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-29.htm">1 Chronicles 23:29</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-16.htm">1 Chronicles 28:16</a>; as also again in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>; and in <a href="/nehemiah/10-33.htm">Nehemiah 10:33</a>. Where in these passages the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> is not expressed, that it is understood may be gathered from the other passages (<a href="/numbers/4-7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a>). The bread consisted of twelve large cakes of unleavened dough (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>), ranged in two heaps, and with a golden cup of frankincense (<a href="/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7</a>) to each pile. When on every seventh day new cakes were substituted, the old ones belonged to the priests (<a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8, 9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-33.htm">Exodus 29:33, 34</a>). The twelve cakes pointed to the twelve tribes. Their size may be judged from the statement that each cake contained two tenth deals, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two-tenths of an ephah, equal to about six pounds and a quarter. The exact significance of this bread is not stated in Scripture. Part of it lay plainly in the twelve cakes, part, perhaps, in their becoming priest's food, found by the people (<a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>), after having been presented seven days before the Lord. Much that is interesting but not finally satisfactory on the question may be found in the article "Shewbread" in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1271. Our Authorized Version "shewbread' comes from Luther's <span class="accented">Schaubrode.</span> Wickliffe, after the Vulgate <span class="accented">panes propositionis</span>, designates it "the loaves of proposition."

The morning and evening offering were alike, viz. a lamb, a meal offering consisting of a tenth of an ephah of flour, mixed with the fourth part of a bin of beaten oil, and a drink offering consisting of the fourth part of a bin of "wine," or of "strong drink."  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I am about to build</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#183;neh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1129.htm">Strong's 1129: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1436;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the Name</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1501;
