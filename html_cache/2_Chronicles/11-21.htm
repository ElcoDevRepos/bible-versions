Absalom was a son of David, known for his rebellion against his father, which adds a layer of complexity to Rehoboam's choice. This preference for Maacah may reflect political alliances, as marriages often served to strengthen ties between powerful families. The mention of "loved" suggests a deep personal affection, which is significant given the cultural context where marriages were often arranged for political reasons. This preference could have influenced his political decisions and the dynamics within his household, as favoritism often led to familial strife, a recurring theme in the narratives of the kings of Israel and Judah.<p><b>In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines,</b><br>Rehoboam's numerous wives and concubines reflect the practices of ancient Near Eastern royalty, where polygamy was common among kings. This practice was often a demonstration of wealth, power, and political alliances. However, it also led to complications, as seen in the lives of his predecessors, David and Solomon. The large number of wives and concubines could have contributed to internal family conflicts and divided loyalties, which were detrimental to the unity of the kingdom. This practice contrasts with the biblical ideal of monogamy as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> and reiterated by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>.<p><b>and he was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.</b><br>The large number of offspring indicates Rehoboam's significant household and the potential for future political alliances through marriage. However, it also posed challenges in terms of succession and governance, as seen in the history of Israel's monarchy. The mention of sons and daughters highlights the importance of lineage and inheritance in the biblical narrative. The numerous children could lead to disputes over succession, as seen in the case of Absalom's rebellion against David. This aspect of Rehoboam's life underscores the recurring biblical theme of the complexities and consequences of polygamous relationships, as well as the importance of wise and just leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, known for his unwise decision that led to the division of the united kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/maacah.htm">Maacah</a></b><br>The daughter of Absalom, favored wife of Rehoboam, indicating her influence in the royal household.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David, known for his rebellion against his father, which adds a layer of complexity to Maacah's background.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom over which Rehoboam reigned after the division of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/polygamy.htm">Polygamy</a></b><br>The practice of having multiple wives and concubines, which was common among kings of that era but often led to familial and spiritual complications.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_favoritism.htm">The Dangers of Favoritism</a></b><br>Rehoboam's favoritism towards Maacah could have led to jealousy and discord within his family.

He singled out Maacah, grand-daughter of King David&#8217;s rebellious son Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a>; 18:18).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s lineage had a complex history of ambition and trouble; yet Rehoboam&#8217;s heart was drawn there, hinting at the ongoing pull of familiar but spiritually risky alliances (compare <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; By elevating one wife above the rest, Rehoboam fostered jealousy and division inside his household, a pattern Solomon experienced earlier with his favored Egyptian princess (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s design from Eden was one man and one woman (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). Whenever an Israelite king departed from that model, trouble followed (see <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, &#8220;He must not take many wives, lest his heart turn away,&#8221;). Rehoboam&#8217;s preference for Maacah foreshadows the influence she later wielded over the kingdom (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines</b><p>&#8226; These numbers are literal, underscoring how far Rehoboam drifted from God&#8217;s standard. Solomon&#8217;s hundreds of wives may dwarf these figures (<a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>), yet the point is the same: multiplying wives multiplies compromise.<p>&#8226; Each marriage likely served political ends&#8212;alliances with influential families&#8212;but spiritual erosion is the long-term cost. The Chronicler records the tally to warn later readers who might excuse similar excess.<p>&#8226; Contrast with the simplicity of Isaac&#8217;s lifelong devotion to Rebekah (<a href="/bsb/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>; 26:8) or Joseph&#8217;s faithfulness to one wife in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45, 50</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters</b><p>&#8226; The sizeable offspring speak to prosperity in human terms, yet they also signal potential strife. Competing heirs from different mothers fueled succession battles in David&#8217;s household (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13&#8211;15</a>), and Rehoboam&#8217;s line was no different (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; More children did not equal more blessing if the home lacked covenant obedience. <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3&#8211;5</a> celebrates children as &#8220;a heritage from the LORD,&#8221; yet the same psalm assumes parents are walking in the fear of God (<a href="/bsb/psalms/128.htm">Psalm 128</a>).<p>&#8226; The Chronicler will later highlight one son, Abijah&#8212;Maacah&#8217;s boy&#8212;as successor (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-22.htm">2 Chronicles 11:22</a>). Favoritism toward both wife and son set the stage for future idolatry (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a> records facts, not ideals. Rehoboam&#8217;s special love for Maacah, his multiplied wives, and his many children all illustrate a king blessed with resources yet drifting from God&#8217;s clear command. The verse teaches that earthly advantage&#8212;political marriages, numerous heirs, deep affections&#8212;cannot replace wholehearted loyalty to the Lord. Choices made in the palace echo through the nation, reminding every believer that obedience and single-minded devotion are still the pathway to lasting blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Loved Maachah.</span>--She probably inherited her mother's and grandfather's beauty.<p><span class= "bld">For he took</span>--<span class= "ital">N?s?',</span> as in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-21.htm" title="But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.">2Chronicles 13:21</a>; a later usage instead of <span class= "ital">l?qah.</span><p><span class= "bld">And threescore concubines.</span>--Josephus (<span class= "ital">l.c.</span>) says, "thirty," and the difference in Hebrew is only of one letter.
