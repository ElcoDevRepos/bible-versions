By following David&#8217;s ordinances, Jehoiada embraces worship that combines sacrificial ritual with heartfelt praise, showing continuity between generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18</a> records Jehoiada&#8217;s decisive act of re-establishing biblical worship. He restores temple oversight to the Levites, follows the organizational blueprint David received from God, revives the sacrifices commanded by Moses, and marries obedience with joyful song. The verse underscores that renewal comes when God&#8217;s people submit to Scripture&#8217;s timeless pattern&#8212;offering themselves wholly to the LORD and celebrating His presence with glad praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Also Jehoiada appointed.</span>--This and the next verse are a thoroughly characteristic expansion of the brief notice: "And the priest set officers over the house of the Lord" (Kings).
