His construction of towers in Jerusalem signifies his focus on strengthening the city's defenses. Towers were strategic military structures used for surveillance and defense against invaders. This action reflects Uzziah's commitment to protecting Jerusalem, the city of God, which held significant religious and political importance for the Israelites.<p><b>at the Corner Gate</b><br>The Corner Gate was a significant point in the wall of Jerusalem, likely located at the northwest corner of the city. Gates were crucial for the defense and control of access to the city. The Corner Gate is mentioned in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>, indicating its importance in the city's layout and defense. Uzziah's work here demonstrates his strategic military planning and his efforts to fortify the city against potential threats.<p><b>the Valley Gate</b><br>The Valley Gate was situated on the western side of Jerusalem, opening towards the Valley of Hinnom. This gate is also mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13 and 3</a>:13, indicating its continued importance in the city's infrastructure. The Valley Gate's location made it a critical point for defense, as it provided access to the valleys surrounding Jerusalem, which could be used by invading forces. Uzziah's fortification of this gate highlights his comprehensive approach to securing the city.<p><b>and the angle in the wall</b><br>The "angle in the wall" likely refers to a corner or a bend in the city's fortifications, which would be a vulnerable point needing reinforcement. Such angles were often targeted by attackers, making them crucial points for additional defense measures. Uzziah's attention to these details underscores his wisdom and diligence in ensuring the city's security.<p><b>and he fortified them</b><br>Fortifying these structures involved strengthening the walls and towers, possibly by adding height, thickness, or additional defensive features such as battlements. This action reflects Uzziah's proactive leadership and his desire to protect his people and the sacred city of Jerusalem. His efforts can be seen as a fulfillment of the kingly duty to safeguard the nation, aligning with the biblical theme of God as a fortress and protector, as seen in Psalms 18:2. Uzziah's reign, marked by such projects, prefigures the ultimate protection and security found in Jesus Christ, who is often depicted as a spiritual fortress for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned for 52 years.

They replaced sections broken down when Joash of Israel breached the wall &#8220;from the Corner Gate to the Ephraim Gate&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>). By raising new stone watchtowers&#8212;just as Asa had earlier fortified cities (2 Chron 14:7)&#8212;Uzziah:<p>&#8226; restored what sin and warfare had damaged in his father&#8217;s day (2 Chron 25:23).<p>&#8226; provided high lookouts so Jerusalem&#8217;s guards could see threats coming (cf. 2 Chron 26:15).<p>&#8226; modeled the principle that &#8220;unless the LORD guards a city, the watchman stays awake in vain&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the Corner Gate</b><p>The Corner Gate marked the northwest angle of Jerusalem&#8217;s wall, a vulnerable spot that invading armies had previously exploited. Jeremiah foresaw this gate as part of a fully rebuilt city under God&#8217;s favor (<a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>), and Uzziah&#8217;s work previews that hope:<p>&#8226; He honors God by repairing what past judgment had shattered.<p>&#8226; He reassures citizens that the city&#8217;s weakest point now stands strongest, echoing how the Lord becomes &#8220;a shield to all who take refuge in Him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Valley Gate</b><p>Situated on the southwest, the Valley Gate opened toward the Hinnom Valley. Nehemiah later surveyed that very opening during his nighttime inspection (<a href="/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13</a>). By fortifying it now, Uzziah:<p>&#8226; secured the lower terrain where enemies could gather unseen.<p>&#8226; protected trade routes and daily traffic, letting ordinary life flourish.<p>&#8226; illustrated vigilance, for believers must guard low points in their own lives just as carefully (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the angle in the wall</b><p>The &#8220;angle&#8221; (or &#8220;turn&#8221;) refers to an exposed bend between gates, also strengthened by Jotham after him (2 Chron 27:3). Strategically, bends create blind spots; spiritually, they picture areas where compromise can slip in. Uzziah&#8217;s additions:<p>&#8226; filled gaps with masonry, preventing flanking attacks.<p>&#8226; mirrored how God &#8220;is my rock and my fortress&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>), surrounding His people on every side.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he fortified them</b><p>Uzziah didn&#8217;t stop at building; he reinforced each structure. Verse 15 notes clever &#8220;machines&#8230; to shoot arrows and large stones,&#8221; foreshadowing Hezekiah&#8217;s later improvements (2 Chron 32:5). His fortification work teaches:<p>&#8226; Protection must be maintained, not merely initiated (cf. <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5&#8211;7</a>&#8217;s call to &#8220;supplement&#8221; faith).<p>&#8226; God-given success invites greater responsibility; pride later tripped Uzziah when he forgot this (2 Chron 26:16).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a> records more than urban development; it testifies to God&#8217;s favor on a king who sought Him. Uzziah rebuilt towers, strengthened three key gates, and fortified every angle, turning former weaknesses into secure defenses. The verse encourages believers to partner with God in safeguarding what He entrusts, knowing that every practical step of obedience rests on the unshakable foundation of His protection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Built towers.</span>--To defend the approaches.<p><span class= "bld">At the corner gate.</span>--<span class= "ital">Over,</span> that is, <span class= "ital">commanding</span> the gate (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-23.htm" title="And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.">2Chronicles 25:23</a>).
