It suggests a culmination of Josiah's efforts to restore proper worship in Judah, as detailed in the preceding verses. The phrase sets the stage for a significant shift in the narrative, moving from religious renewal to political and military conflict.<p><b>when Josiah had set the temple in order</b><br>Josiah's reforms included purging idolatry and restoring the temple, aligning with the covenantal laws found in Deuteronomy. This phrase highlights his commitment to spiritual renewal and adherence to the Law of Moses. The temple's restoration was a significant achievement, symbolizing the nation's return to Yahweh. It reflects Josiah's dedication to God, reminiscent of King Hezekiah's earlier reforms.<p><b>Neco king of Egypt marched up to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates</b><br>Pharaoh Neco II was a prominent Egyptian ruler during this period, known for his military campaigns. Carchemish was a strategic city located on the Euphrates River, a key location for controlling trade routes and military movements. This battle was part of the larger conflict between the declining Assyrian Empire and the rising Babylonian power. Neco's march indicates Egypt's interest in supporting Assyria against Babylon, reflecting the complex geopolitical dynamics of the time.<p><b>and Josiah went out to confront him</b><br>Josiah's decision to confront Neco is puzzling, as it appears to be a political and military miscalculation. The biblical narrative does not provide explicit reasons for Josiah's actions, but it may reflect his desire to assert Judah's independence or align with Babylon against Assyria and Egypt. This confrontation ultimately leads to Josiah's death, marking a turning point in Judah's history. Josiah's actions can be seen as a tragic end to his otherwise faithful reign, with his death foreshadowing the impending Babylonian exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah known for his religious reforms and dedication to restoring the worship of Yahweh.

Nothing is said in our history or its parallel to accredit the tale of Necho, or to discredit the heart and motive of Josiah - nothing <span class="accented">except</span> what silence and the result <span class="accented">seem</span> to say. One other clement of interest and of difficulty may be added to the question; for of the thirteen years' interval, which we have described above as one presumably of happy retrospect in certain aspects for Josiah, we know nothing from Scripture, but have <span class="accented">every</span> reason to suppose that during it Josiah and his kingdom had become subject, if only nominally, to Nabopolassar; so that, in offering to resist Necho of Egypt, he was offering to strengthen so far forth the royal line which did dishonour to his own country and his country's God. Upon this supposition, however, we can lay no stress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Josiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2977.htm">Strong's 2977: </a> </span><span class="str2">Josiah -- 'Yah supports', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1499;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3559.htm">Strong's 3559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be erect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the temple {in order},</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
