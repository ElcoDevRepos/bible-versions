Abijah was the son of Rehoboam and the second king of Judah after the division of the united monarchy. His reign is briefly covered in <a href="/2_chronicles/13.htm">2 Chronicles 13</a>, where he is noted for his battle against Jeroboam of Israel. The phrase suggests that there were additional deeds and events during his reign that are not included in the biblical narrative.<p><b>along with his ways and his words</b><br>This suggests a comprehensive record of Abijah's life, including his behavior, policies, and possibly his speeches or proclamations. The "ways" could refer to his conduct and the manner in which he ruled, while "words" might include his declarations or teachings. This implies that Abijah's reign had significant aspects that were noteworthy, possibly including religious reforms or political strategies.<p><b>are written in the Treatise of the Prophet Iddo</b><br>The mention of the "Treatise of the Prophet Iddo" indicates a source outside the canonical scriptures that recorded historical events. Iddo was a prophet during the time of the divided kingdom, and his writings are referenced elsewhere in the Bible (e.g., <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>). This suggests that there were other historical records and prophetic writings that chronicled the events of the kings of Judah and Israel.

Scripture tells us, &#8220;Abijah grew strong, married fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-21.htm">2 Chronicles 13:21</a>). The Chronicler&#8217;s statement reminds us that God&#8217;s Word selects events with purpose; what is recorded is fully reliable, yet not exhaustive. Other kings receive similar notices&#8212;compare &#8220;Now the rest of the acts of Asa&#8230; are written in the Book of the Kings&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a>). These echoes assure us that the Lord has preserved every detail we truly need (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30&#8211;31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with his ways</b><p>&#8220;Ways&#8221; points to Abijah&#8217;s personal conduct and spiritual orientation. Earlier, he publicly declared, &#8220;But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-10.htm">2 Chronicles 13:10</a>), setting Judah apart from idolatrous Israel. Yet <a href="/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3</a> records that &#8220;his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God.&#8221; Scripture holds both realities together: Abijah could speak courageously for the Lord in one moment and still carry lingering compromise in another, reflecting the mixed legacy of his father Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-14.htm">2 Chronicles 12:14</a>). Believers today gain cautionary insight&#8212;victories of faith do not cancel the call to daily holiness (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his words</b><p>The chapter already preserves a sample: Abijah&#8217;s passionate speech on Mount Zemaraim (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4&#8211;12</a>). In it he appeals to covenant truth, the priesthood, and God&#8217;s faithfulness. <a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a> reminds us, &#8220;Death and life are in the power of the tongue,&#8221; and Abijah&#8217;s words rallied Judah and exposed Jeroboam&#8217;s rebellion. That the Chronicler singles out &#8220;words&#8221; alongside &#8220;acts&#8221; underlines divine interest not only in what we do but in what we say (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>). Every recorded royal proclamation&#8212;from David&#8217;s psalms (<a href="/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1&#8211;2</a>) to Hezekiah&#8217;s prayers (<a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15&#8211;19</a>)&#8212;shows God&#8217;s concern for speech that honors Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are written in the Treatise of the Prophet Iddo</b><p>Iddo&#8217;s work, now lost, served as a contemporaneous record. The mention of a &#8220;treatise&#8221; indicates a formal, trustworthy chronicle compiled by a recognized prophet (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>; 12:15). While the Spirit chose not to preserve Iddo&#8217;s book for later generations, its citation bolsters the historical credibility of Chronicles&#8212;rooted in verifiable sources, not legend (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1&#8211;4</a>). It also hints at the richness of God&#8217;s dealings beyond our current canon; eternity will unveil all that He has done (<a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>). Until then, the inspired text we possess is sufficient for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a> signals that Abijah&#8217;s life was larger than one chapter: his deeds, character, and speeches mattered, and they were carefully documented by the prophet Iddo.
