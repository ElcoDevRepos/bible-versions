Tyre was a prominent Phoenician city known for its skilled craftsmen and abundant resources, particularly cedar wood. The correspondence between Hiram and Solomon highlights the diplomatic and trade relationships that were crucial for the construction of the Temple. This alliance reflects the broader geopolitical landscape of the ancient Near East, where Israel maintained peaceful relations with neighboring states. The letter signifies mutual respect and cooperation, emphasizing the importance of international relations in achieving national goals.<p><b>Because the LORD loves His people:</b><br>This phrase underscores the theological belief that God's love for Israel is the foundation of His actions and decisions. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God's love is manifested in His provision and protection. This love is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>, where God's choice of Israel is attributed to His love and faithfulness. Hiram's acknowledgment of God's love suggests a recognition of Israel's unique status among the nations, even by foreign rulers.<p><b>He has set you over them as king:</b><br>Solomon's kingship is portrayed as a divine appointment, emphasizing the belief that rulers are established by God's sovereign will. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, which states that all authority is instituted by God. Solomon's reign is seen as a continuation of the Davidic covenant, where God promised David that his descendants would rule Israel. Solomon's wisdom and wealth are often viewed as evidence of God's blessing, fulfilling the promises made to David. This phrase also foreshadows the messianic expectation of a future king from David's line, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is seen as the eternal King set over God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram,_king_of_tyre.htm">Hiram, King of Tyre</a></b><br>Hiram was the king of Tyre, a city-state known for its skilled craftsmen and abundant resources.

God&#8217;s steadfast love is so evident that outsiders notice.<p>&#8226; Hiram uses the covenant name &#8220;LORD&#8221; (YHWH), acknowledging Israel&#8217;s God, not a regional deity. Similar recognition comes from Rahab (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a>) and Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34&#8211;37</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s love is practical: He provides leadership, land, and worship. <a href="/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a> says, &#8220;He chooses our inheritance for us.&#8221; The temple project Hiram is assisting will magnify that love by giving Israel a permanent house of worship.<p>&#8226; This moment hints at a broader, future love that reaches beyond Israel (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>), yet it never diminishes His special affection for His covenant people (<a href="/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has set you over them as king</b><p>&#8220;He has set you over them as king&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-11.htm">2 Chronicles 2:11</a>c)<p>&#8226; Hiram recognizes that Solomon&#8217;s throne is God-given, echoing <a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5&#8211;6</a> where the LORD tells David, &#8220;I have chosen Solomon&#8230; to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s authority serves the people&#8217;s welfare.

In the parallel of Kings an identical expression is used for the communications of both: "Solomon sent to Hiram" (ver. 2), and "Hiram sent to Solomon" (ver. 8). The productions of the forms of this correspondence by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 8:2)and Eupolemus ('Ap. Praep. Evang.,' 9:33) are, of course, merely mythical. <span class="cmt_word">Because the Lord hath loved his people.</span> This beautiful expression has parallels, not only in such passages as <a href="/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>; but in such as <a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/115-12.htm">Psalm 115:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 4</a>. These were all precursors of the fuller assertion and kinder demonstration of God's love repeated so often and in such tender connections in the Epistles of the New Testament. This verse and the following are also testimony to the indirect influences on surrounding nations of the knowledge of the one true Creator-God and Ruler-God, that was domiciled by special revelation and oracle (<a href="/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>) with Israel. Where nations near were bitter foes, they often feared Israel's God, whereas now they were friends they could summon to their lips the highest of the outbursts of praise, not to say of adoration. The very noteworthy sympathy of Hiram with Israel may have owed something to his personal predilection for David (<a href="/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>).
