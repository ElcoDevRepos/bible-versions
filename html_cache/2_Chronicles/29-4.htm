The priests and Levites were the religious leaders responsible for temple worship and rituals. Their involvement signifies a return to proper worship practices, as they had been neglected during the reign of Hezekiah's father, Ahaz. The Levites, descendants of Levi, were set apart for temple service, while the priests, descendants of Aaron, were responsible for sacrifices. This action reflects the importance of spiritual leadership in guiding the nation back to faithfulness.<p><b>and gathered them in the square</b><br>The gathering in the square indicates a public assembly, emphasizing transparency and communal involvement in the religious reforms. This public setting allowed for accountability and demonstrated the seriousness of the king's intentions. The square, often a central place in ancient cities, served as a venue for important announcements and gatherings, reinforcing the communal aspect of the reforms.<p><b>on the east side</b><br>The east side of the temple holds significant symbolic meaning in biblical tradition. The entrance to the temple faced east, symbolizing the direction of the rising sun and new beginnings. This orientation is also associated with the return of God's glory, as seen in Ezekiel's vision (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-4</a>).
