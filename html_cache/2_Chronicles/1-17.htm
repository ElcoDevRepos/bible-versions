The mention of "six hundred shekels of silver" indicates the high value and cost of these chariots, reflecting the wealth and trade relationships during Solomon's reign. This trade with Egypt highlights the political alliances and economic strategies that Solomon employed to strengthen his kingdom. The use of silver as currency underscores the economic systems in place during this period, where precious metals were standard for trade and commerce.<p><b>and a horse for a hundred and fifty</b><br>The price of "a hundred and fifty" shekels for a horse further illustrates the significant investment in military resources. Horses were essential for chariots, which were a crucial part of ancient warfare. This detail emphasizes the importance of maintaining a strong military presence and the resources required to do so. The acquisition of horses from Egypt also suggests a reliance on foreign powers for military supplies, which could be seen as a strategic move to ensure the kingdom's security and dominance.<p><b>Likewise, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram</b><br>The exportation of chariots and horses to "the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram" indicates Solomon's role as a central figure in regional trade. The Hittites and Arameans were significant powers in the ancient Near East, and trade with them would have strengthened political alliances and economic ties. This exportation also demonstrates the extent of Solomon's influence and the prosperity of his kingdom, as he was able to act as a middleman in the trade of these valuable military assets.

Six hundred shekels equaled roughly fifteen pounds of silver, underscoring the prosperity God granted Solomon in fulfillment of <a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>.<p>&#8226; The detail also highlights extensive trade links with Egypt, mirroring <a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28-29</a>. While factual, that connection pokes at the warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> not to &#8220;multiply horses&#8221; or send people back to Egypt. Prosperity is a gift, yet it comes with potential spiritual drift if dependence shifts from the Lord to military assets (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a horse for a hundred and fifty</b><p>&#8226; A horse cost one-quarter the price of a chariot. The numbers read like an ancient price list, reminding us the text is historical, not mythical.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s stables (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>) required thousands of horses, so the totals represented a sizeable treasury outlay and a visible sign of power.<p>&#8226; Yet God had said Israel&#8217;s king must &#8220;not acquire great numbers of horses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>). The verse therefore hints at a slow slide from wholehearted trust in God to confidence in resources. <a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a> later foretells a day when God &#8220;will cut off the chariot&#8230;and the warhorse,&#8221; restoring reliance on Him alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Likewise, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites</b><p>&#8226; Israel was not only buying; it was selling. Positioned along major trade routes, the nation became a regional arms broker. This recalls God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a> that obedience would make Israel the lending&#8212;not borrowing&#8212;nation.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;kings of the Hittites&#8221; likely refer to northern Syrian and Anatolian rulers (see <a href="/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>), people who had longstanding interactions with Israel. Commerce offered influence, yet it also meant military technology flowing outward. By <a href="/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7-8</a> Solomon was conscripting remnant peoples; now he is outfitting foreign kings, a move that could come back to haunt future generations (compare <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>, where God terrifies the Arameans with &#8220;the noise of chariots and horses&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to the kings of Aram</b><p>&#8226; Aram (Syria) would soon become a primary adversary (<a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23-25</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>). Ironically, Solomon&#8217;s trade may have strengthened the very armies that later attacked Israel.<p>&#8226; The line illustrates how material success can create unintended consequences. What seems like shrewd economics can sow seeds of future conflict when divorced from wholehearted obedience (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, the chronicler includes the fact without embellishment, confirming both the blessing of God-given wisdom that drew international attention (<a href="/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>) and the creeping compromises that foreshadow Israel&#8217;s later troubles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/1-17.htm">2 Chronicles 1:17</a> is a snapshot of Solomon&#8217;s era, revealing literal prices, extensive trade, and God-granted prosperity.
