This duration suggests stability and continuity in the kingdom, which was significant in the context of the divided monarchy. Asa's reign is marked by initial faithfulness to God, including religious reforms and reliance on divine help against enemies. However, his later years were characterized by a decline in faith, as he relied on human alliances rather than God (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>). The length of his reign also reflects God's patience and the opportunity for repentance, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Asa died</b><br>Asa's death marks the end of an era for Judah. His life serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of turning away from God after a strong start. Asa's reliance on physicians rather than seeking the Lord in his illness (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>) highlights a spiritual decline. This serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining faith and trust in God throughout one's life. Asa's death also transitions the narrative to his son Jehoshaphat, who would continue the lineage of Davidic kings.<p><b>and rested with his fathers</b><br>The phrase "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical expression indicating death and burial, often used for the kings of Israel and Judah. It implies a joining with ancestors in the afterlife, reflecting the belief in a continued existence beyond death. This phrase also signifies Asa's inclusion in the lineage of David, maintaining the covenantal promise God made to David about his descendants (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The concept of resting with one's fathers can be seen as a type of the ultimate rest found in Christ, who offers eternal rest to believers (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah who reigned for 41 years.

Asa had begun well (2 Chron 14:2-5) and even led the people in covenant renewal (2 Chron 15:12-15).<p>&#8226; Yet, by year thirty-six he relied on Syria instead of the Lord (2 Chron 16:1-3), and by year thirty-nine his diseased feet still did not drive him to seek God (2 Chron 16:12).<p>&#8226; The forty-first year becomes a sober marker: time finally ran out. <a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a> urges us to &#8220;number our days&#8221; for this very reason.<p>The phrase teaches that however lengthy a reign&#8212;or a life&#8212;may seem, it has a set boundary established by God (<a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Asa died</b><p>Death closes Asa&#8217;s earthly ledger.<p>&#8226; The record is brutally simple: &#8220;Asa died.&#8221; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> states, &#8220;It is appointed for men to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Asa&#8217;s earlier trust brought national blessing (2 Chron 14:6-7), but his later compromises brought rebuke (2 Chron 16:7-9). Both realities now meet God&#8217;s verdict.<p>&#8226; 2 Chron 16:12 hints that his lingering illness contributed to his death, underscoring that physical consequences often follow spiritual choices.<p>&#8226; Yet the text does not linger on failure alone; it reports the fact without commentary, letting earlier chapters speak to character and legacy.<p>Here the Spirit reminds readers that every king, no matter how powerful, must stand before the true King.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and rested with his fathers</b><p>The chronicler&#8217;s closing phrase signals burial and&#8212;beyond that&#8212;hope.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Rested with his fathers&#8221; echoes David&#8217;s epitaph (<a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>) and Solomon&#8217;s (<a href="/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>), placing Asa in the same covenant line.<p>&#8226; Rest does not imply annihilation; Jesus likened death to sleep (<a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>), and Paul wrote that &#8220;God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The burial details that follow (2 Chron 16:14) show honor: Asa is laid in the City of David, among predecessors awaiting resurrection (<a href="/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29, 34</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase therefore balances the starkness of death with the believer&#8217;s expectation of future awakening (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>).<p>Even after a mixed record, Asa&#8217;s covenant relationship secures him a place among the fathers, illustrating God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/16-13.htm">2 Chronicles 16:13</a> marks the end of Asa&#8217;s forty-one-year reign, a lifespan bounded by God&#8217;s timing.

(See <a href="/1_kings/15-10.htm" title="And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem.

The parallel, however (<a href="/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a>), makes this date one and the same thing with his "old age<span class="accented"></span>," while no manipulation of dates can make him (the grandson of Rehoboam and son of Abijah) more than about fifty. And it is somewhat remarkable that, when introduced to us as succeeding to the throne, nothing is said of his tender youth (as, for instance, is said in the case of Josiah, <a href="/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-3</a>). Nevertheless, the apparent prominence of Maachah awhile would tally with the circumstance of Asa's youth at his accession. Another correspondence in Josiah's career is noticeable; for it is distinctly said that when he was only twelve years of age (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3</a>) "he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places," etc. At a similarly youthful age Asa, therefore, may be credited with doing the like, while later on he took more stringent measures, as for instance with Maachah, the queen-mother. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/16-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So in the forty-first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_705.htm">Strong's 705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Forty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1435;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
