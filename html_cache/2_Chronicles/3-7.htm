Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, was extensively used in the tabernacle and later in Solomon's temple, reflecting the glory and majesty of God. The overlaying of beams, thresholds, walls, and doors with gold indicates the comprehensive sanctification of the temple structure. This practice can be seen as a continuation of the instructions given for the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-27</a>, where gold was used to cover the Ark of the Covenant and other sacred items. The opulence of the temple also prefigures the heavenly Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the city is made of pure gold, symbolizing the ultimate dwelling place of God with humanity.<p><b>and he carved cherubim on the walls</b><br>Cherubim are angelic beings often associated with the presence and holiness of God. Their depiction in the temple serves as a reminder of the divine protection and the sacredness of the space. In the tabernacle, cherubim were embroidered on the curtains and the veil (<a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>), and they were also part of the mercy seat on the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>). The presence of cherubim in the temple's design connects the temple to the Garden of Eden, where cherubim guarded the way to the Tree of Life (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). This imagery underscores the temple as a place where heaven and earth meet, a type of the restored fellowship between God and humanity. The cherubim also point to the role of Jesus Christ as the mediator who grants believers access to the presence of God, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was tasked with building the temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling his father David's vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy place where God's presence was to dwell among His people, serving as a central place of worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gold_overlay.htm">Gold Overlay</a></b><br>Symbolizes the purity, holiness, and divine nature of the temple, reflecting God's glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings carved on the walls, representing the presence and protection of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city chosen by God as the spiritual center for His people, where the temple was constructed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_gold.htm">The Significance of Gold</a></b><br>Gold in the temple signifies the value and purity that God desires in our worship and lives.
