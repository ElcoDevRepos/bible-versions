His desire to build a temple reflects his heart for worship and his longing to honor God. This phrase highlights David's personal relationship with God and his role as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). David's intention to build the temple was not just a political or cultural ambition but a spiritual aspiration rooted in his love for God.<p><b>to build a house for the Name of the LORD</b><br>The "house" refers to the temple, a central place of worship for the Israelites. The temple was to be a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The phrase "for the Name of the LORD" emphasizes the temple's purpose: to glorify God and serve as a testament to His covenant with Israel. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of building temples to honor deities, but uniquely, it was for the one true God, Yahweh.<p><b>the God of Israel</b><br>This designation underscores the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It distinguishes Yahweh from the gods of surrounding nations and reaffirms His unique identity as the God who delivered Israel from Egypt and established them in the Promised Land. The temple was to be a place where Israel could worship and seek guidance from their covenant God, reinforcing their identity as His chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who had a deep desire to build a temple for the Lord.
