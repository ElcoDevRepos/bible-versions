The number ten often symbolizes completeness or divine order in the Bible, suggesting the thoroughness of Solomon's preparations for worship. The tables were part of the furnishings of Solomon's Temple, which was a central place of worship for the Israelites and a symbol of God's presence among His people.<p><b>and placed them in the temple,</b><br>The temple referred to is Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, a magnificent structure that served as the primary place of worship for the Israelites. The placement of the tables within the temple signifies their importance in the rituals and ceremonies conducted there. The temple itself was a fulfillment of God's promise to David and a central location for the sacrificial system, which pointed forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<p><b>five on the south side and five on the north.</b><br>The arrangement of the tables, five on each side, reflects a balance and symmetry that is often seen in biblical descriptions of sacred spaces. This orderly placement may symbolize the order and harmony that God desires in worship. The north and south sides of the temple would have been significant in terms of accessibility and the flow of worship activities.<p><b>He also made a hundred gold bowls.</b><br>The gold bowls were likely used for holding incense or for the libations that accompanied the sacrifices. Gold, being a precious metal, signifies the value and purity required in worship. The number one hundred may indicate abundance and the readiness of the temple to accommodate the needs of the worshippers.

It were well if, in names such as these, at any rate, an absolute uniformity of version were observed in the translation, for the benefit of the English reader, to say nothing of the saving of wasted time for the student and scholar. These <span class="accented">basins</span>, or <span class="accented">bowls</span>, were to receive and hold the blood of the slain victims, about to be sprinkled for purification (see <a href="/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6-8</a>, where the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> is used; Exodus 29:12, 10, 20, 21; <a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>, and <span class="accented">passion</span>; <a href="/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18-20</a>; see also <a href="/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-14.htm">Numbers 4:14</a>,) The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span>, whether appearing in our version as" basin"' or "bowl," occurs thirty-two times, sixteen in association exactly similar with the present (viz. <a href="/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-14.htm">Numbers 4:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40, 45, 50</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-13.htm">2 Kings 12:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-17.htm">1 Chronicles 28:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">2 Chronicles 4:8, 11, 22</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-18.htm">Jeremiah 52:18, 19</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>), fourteen as <span class="accented">silver bowls</span> in the time of the tabernacle for the meat offering of "fine flour mingled with oil" (vie. <a href="/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79, 84, 85</a>), and the remaining two in an entirely general application (<a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-15.htm">Zechariah 9:15</a>). It is evident, therefore, that the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span> was not the only vessel used for holding the blood of purification, nor was it exclusively reserved to this use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Additionally, he made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
