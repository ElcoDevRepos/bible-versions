His reign was marked by a continuation of the idolatrous practices that his father had initially embraced before his repentance. The term "servants" likely refers to officials or members of his court, indicating internal strife and dissatisfaction with his rule. This reflects the instability and moral decline in Judah during this period, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/21-19.htm">2 Kings 21:19-23</a>, where Amon's reign is described as evil in the sight of the Lord.<p><b>conspired against him</b><br>The conspiracy against Amon suggests a significant level of discontent among those closest to him. This act of treachery may have been motivated by political ambition, personal grievances, or a reaction to his idolatrous practices. Conspiracies were not uncommon in the ancient Near East, where palace intrigue often led to violent power shifts. This mirrors other biblical accounts of conspiracies, such as the one against King Joash in <a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>.<p><b>and killed him</b><br>Amon's assassination was a violent end to a short reign of only two years. His death highlights the consequences of his failure to follow the ways of the Lord, as his father eventually did. The act of killing a king was a serious offense, often leading to further instability and retribution. This event underscores the biblical theme of divine justice and the consequences of sin, as seen in the broader narrative of the kings of Israel and Judah.<p><b>in his palace</b><br>The palace was not only the king's residence but also the center of political power. Amon's murder within the palace walls indicates a breach of security and trust, emphasizing the depth of betrayal by those who were supposed to protect him. The palace setting also symbolizes the corruption and moral decay that had infiltrated the highest levels of leadership in Judah. This setting is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where significant events occur within royal palaces, such as the murder of King Joash in <a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>Amon was the son of Manasseh and became king of Judah.

Amon, son of Manasseh, had reigned only two years and had stubbornly persisted in idolatry (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-21.htm">2 Chronicles 33:21&#8211;23</a>; cf. <a href="/2_kings/21-19.htm">2 Kings 21:19&#8211;22</a>). Scripture shows a pattern: when a king hardens his heart, judgment follows in God&#8217;s perfect timing. &#8220;Then&#8221; signals that the consequence came swiftly&#8212;much like the rapid downfall of Nadab (<a href="/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25&#8211;28</a>) and Amaziah (<a href="/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>)&#8212;underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness to His warnings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15, 25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the servants of Amon</b><p>These were not hostile foreign invaders; they were the very officials charged with protecting the king. Similar inner-court betrayals appear with Elah&#8217;s servant Zimri (<a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9</a>) and Joash&#8217;s servants (<a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>). Such accounts remind us that sin erodes trust and destabilizes even the closest circles. <a href="/proverbs/29-12.htm">Proverbs 29:12</a> notes, &#8220;If a ruler listens to lies, all his servants become wicked,&#8221; a truth played out in Amon&#8217;s palace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>conspired against him</b><p>A secret plot formed&#8212;premeditated, deliberate, and sinful.

While the conspirators acted of their own will, the Lord remained in control, moving Judah toward the reforms that would come under Josiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-1.htm">2 Chronicles 34:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and killed him</b><p>The conspiracy reached its violent climax: &#8220;and killed him.&#8221; Scripture records several royal assassinations (<a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-23.htm">2 Kings 21:23</a>) to show that a ruler&#8217;s unrepentant sin brings personal ruin (<a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>). God&#8217;s law forbade murder (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>), yet He permitted human freedom; here, that freedom produced bloodshed, highlighting both man&#8217;s accountability and God&#8217;s justice (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in his palace</b><p>The palace&#8212;symbol of power and security&#8212;could not shield Amon. <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a> declares, &#8220;Unless the LORD guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.&#8221; Palatial walls and royal guards failed because the king&#8217;s heart was far from God. The location underscores the futility of trusting in human defenses rather than the Lord (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/33-24.htm">2 Chronicles 33:24</a> records the swift judgment that fell on a rebellious king. Amon&#8217;s own attendants plotted, carried out, and completed his assassination right where he presumed himself safest.
