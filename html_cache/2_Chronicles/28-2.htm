The "kings of Israel" refers to the northern kingdom, which had a history of idolatry and rebellion against God. This behavior contrasts with the Davidic line in Judah, which, despite its flaws, had moments of reform and adherence to God's laws. The phrase suggests a deliberate choice to follow a path known for its disobedience and idolatry, as seen in the actions of kings like Jeroboam, who set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p><b>and even made cast images of the Baals</b><br>The making of "cast images" refers to the creation of idols, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). The "Baals" were Canaanite deities associated with fertility and weather, often worshiped through rituals that included immoral practices. This act of creating images for Baal worship signifies a deep level of apostasy, as it not only breaks the first two commandments but also aligns the king with the pagan practices of the surrounding nations. This idolatry was a recurring issue for Israel and Judah, leading to prophetic warnings and eventual judgment, as seen in the ministries of prophets like Elijah and Hosea. The worship of Baal is also a stark contrast to the worship of Yahweh, who is spirit and cannot be represented by physical images (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during a time of spiritual decline.
