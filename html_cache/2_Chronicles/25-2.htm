In the context of the Old Testament, doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD often refers to adherence to the Mosaic Law and the worship of Yahweh alone, as opposed to idolatry. This is a common evaluation of the kings of Israel and Judah, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11</a> regarding Asa and <a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3</a> regarding Hezekiah. The phrase suggests a level of obedience and alignment with God's expectations, which was crucial for the kings of Judah to maintain God's favor and the stability of their reign.<p><b>but not wholeheartedly</b><br>This part of the verse reveals a significant shortcoming in Amaziah's devotion. While he performed actions that were outwardly correct, his heart was not fully committed to God. This lack of wholeheartedness is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God desires not just external compliance but internal devotion and sincerity, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart. Amaziah's incomplete devotion is further illustrated in <a href="/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>, where he turns to idolatry after a military victory. This half-heartedness serves as a warning and a lesson about the importance of complete dedication to God, a theme echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/revelation/3-16.htm">Revelation 3:16</a>, where lukewarm faith is rebuked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned after his father Joash.
