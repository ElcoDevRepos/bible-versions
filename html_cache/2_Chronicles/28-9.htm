Prophets often served as God's mouthpiece, delivering messages of warning, judgment, or hope. The presence of Oded highlights God's continued involvement and concern for His people, even during times of moral and spiritual decline. Prophets like Oded were crucial in guiding the Israelites back to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>and he went out to meet the army that returned to Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The army's return to Samaria indicates a military campaign, likely against Judah, which was common during the divided monarchy period. The act of going out to meet the army suggests urgency and courage on Oded's part, as prophets often confronted kings and armies to deliver God's message, regardless of personal risk.<p><b>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said to them</b><br>The word "Look" serves as an imperative, drawing attention to the seriousness of the message. Prophets often used direct and commanding language to ensure their audience understood the gravity of the situation. This introduction sets the stage for a divine rebuke, emphasizing the need for the army to heed the forthcoming message.<p><b>&#8220;because of His wrath against Judah, the LORD, the God of your fathers, has delivered them into your hand</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty and justice. The mention of "wrath" indicates divine judgment, often a response to covenant unfaithfulness. The reference to "the God of your fathers" connects the current generation to the covenantal promises and responsibilities given to the patriarchs. The delivery of Judah into Israel's hands is portrayed as an act of God, not merely a military victory, emphasizing that God uses nations to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches up to heaven</b><br>The phrase "in a rage that reaches up to heaven" suggests excessive violence and injustice, which God condemns. This echoes the biblical principle that while God may use nations to execute judgment, He holds them accountable for their actions. The imagery of reaching "up to heaven" implies that the sin is so great it demands divine attention and intervention. This serves as a warning that God's people must act justly, even in warfare, reflecting His character and commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oded.htm">Oded</a></b><br>A prophet of the LORD who confronted the Israelite army.

By exceeding divine intent and slaughtering with unbridled fury, they themselves stand under judgment. The passage teaches that God may use even flawed people to accomplish His purposes, yet He never condones cruelty or pride. Obedience requires not only doing what God commands but doing it in His character&#8212;just, measured, and compassionate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">THE PROPHET ODED PROTESTS AGAINST RETENTION OF THE JEWISH CAPTIVES, AND THEY ARE SENT HOME</span> (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/28-9.htm" title="But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage that reaches up to heaven.">2Chronicles 28:9-15</a>).<p>(9) <span class= "bld">But a prophet of the Lord.</span>--This whole section is peculiar to the chronicler. The author has told the story in his own way; and perhaps the words of the prophet and the chiefs are mainly his. But there is no ground for doubting the general truth of the narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Was there.</span>--In Samaria. It is remarkable that neither here nor in the parallel narrative is any mention made of the great prophet Hosea ben Beeri, who must have been active at this epoch in the northern kingdom. Of <span class= "ital">Oded</span> nothing further is known. He was a "prophet of Jehovah," not of the Baals.<p><span class= "bld">He went out before.</span>--To <span class= "ital">meet</span> the hosts, like <span class= "ital">Azariah ben Oded</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm" title="And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while you be with him; and if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.">2Chronicles 15:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That came.</span>--<span class= "ital">Was coming in.</span><p><span class= "bld">Because the Lord . . . was wroth.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in the wrath of Jehovah . . .</span> <span class= "ital">against Judah he gave them into your hand.</span> Your victory was due to the punitive wrath of Jehovah, not to your own valour or intrinsic superiority. You ought to have considered this, and shown compassion to the victims of divine displeasure; but you have, on the contrary, given full rein to the savage dictates of furious hatred.<p><span class= "bld">Slain them.</span>--<span class= "ital">Slain among them.</span><p><span class= "bld">In a rage.</span>--<a href="/2_chronicles/26-19.htm" title="Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.">2Chronicles 26:19</a> (<span class= "ital">za'af</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The very interesting contents of this and the following six verses are not found in the parallel. <span class="cmt_word">A prophet of the Lord... Oded</span>. We do not know any particulars of this prophet; for his name and its possible identity with the name Iddo, see notes on 2 Chronicles 9:29; 15:1, 8. The growingly frequent references to the interposition of the prophets is much to be noticed, and their dignity, courage, fidelity, are brought into grand relief. They are very typical of the moral presence of which no national history, a.s centuries solemnly flow on, gives the slightest symptom of a slackening need. The very same may be said alike of the truth and those qualified and commissioned to bear it, of the message and the messenger. <span class="cmt_word">Before the host</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in very face of the host, somewhat too mildly rendered "to meet" the host, in <a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">In a rage that reacheth up unto heaven</span>. To the wonderful life of this figure, that must strike every reader, must be added the force that comes of its moral rather than merely material suggestion - a moral suggestion that reminds us of that of the sentence of far greater antiquity, and from the sacred lip of the Inspirer of all prophets, "The voice of thy brother's blood <span class="accented">crieth unto me</span> from the ground." The rage had not been that on which the sun did <span class="accented">not</span> go down; it had been so fierce that upon it the sun ought never to have been required to look. See for interesting particulars and then more general references, <a href="/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>; <a href="/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="/job/20-6.htm">Job 20:6</a>. The expression of the text, however, "reach-eth," or "toucheth," cannot be understood to reproduce as a perfect equivalent the older above-quoted one of "crieth." In other words, the magnitude of the rage is the first thing set forth, and the particular language in which it is set forth well postulates the inference of its abominableness in God's sight. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/28-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But a prophet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5030.htm">Strong's 5030: </a> </span><span class="str2">A spokesman, speaker, prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
