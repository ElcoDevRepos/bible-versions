The eighteenth year of his reign would make him 26 years old. This period marks a significant turning point in his leadership, as he initiates religious reforms and temple restoration. Josiah's reign is noted for its return to the worship of Yahweh and the eradication of idolatry, aligning with the Deuteronomic reforms.<p><b>in order to cleanse the land and the temple</b><br>Josiah's reforms were aimed at purifying both the land of Judah and the temple in Jerusalem from idolatrous practices. This cleansing was necessary due to the previous reigns of kings like Manasseh and Amon, who had introduced and supported idol worship. The cleansing of the temple is reminiscent of the actions of Hezekiah, another reforming king, and foreshadows the cleansing of the temple by Jesus in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12-13</a>).<p><b>Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah</b><br>Shaphan was a scribe, a position of significant influence and responsibility. His role in the reforms highlights the importance of the written word and the rediscovery of the Book of the Law during this period. Shaphan's family continued to play a crucial role in the spiritual and political life of Judah, as seen in the involvement of his descendants in later events (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>).<p><b>Maaseiah the governor of the city</b><br>Maaseiah held a high-ranking position as the governor of Jerusalem, indicating the political support Josiah had for his reforms. The involvement of civic leaders in religious reforms underscores the integration of faith and governance in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>and Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder</b><br>Joah, as the recorder, was responsible for maintaining official records and documents. His inclusion in this mission suggests the importance of documenting the reforms and the restoration process. This role is crucial for ensuring that the reforms were not only implemented but also preserved for future generations.<p><b>to repair the house of the LORD his God</b><br>The temple, referred to as the house of the LORD, was central to Israelite worship and identity. Its repair signified a return to proper worship and covenant faithfulness. This restoration project is a type of Christ, who is seen as the ultimate restorer of the temple, both in a physical sense (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>) and in the spiritual sense as the cornerstone of the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who began his reign at a young age and was known for his reforms and dedication to the LORD.
