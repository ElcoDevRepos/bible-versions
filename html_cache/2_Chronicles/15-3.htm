This period of apostasy is reminiscent of the time of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The absence of the true God in their lives led to moral and social chaos, as seen in the repeated cycles of sin and redemption throughout Israel's history. This serves as a warning of the consequences of abandoning God, emphasizing the need for continual faithfulness and devotion.<p><b>without a priest to instruct them</b><br>The role of the priest in Israel was crucial for maintaining the spiritual health of the nation. Priests were responsible for teaching the Law, leading worship, and offering sacrifices. Without a priest to instruct them, the people lacked spiritual guidance and understanding of God's commandments. This absence is significant because it points to a breakdown in the religious structure that God had established through Moses. The priesthood was meant to be a bridge between God and the people, and without it, the nation was left in spiritual darkness. This situation foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who perfectly mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and without the law</b><br>The law, given through Moses, was the foundation of Israel's covenant relationship with God. It provided moral, ceremonial, and civil guidelines for living a life pleasing to God. Being without the law meant that the people were not only ignorant of God's standards but also unable to live in a way that honored Him. This neglect of the law often led to idolatry and injustice, as seen in various periods of Israel's history. The law also pointed forward to Christ, who fulfilled its requirements and brought a new covenant based on grace and truth (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, <a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>).

This translation is wrong; translate rather first, <span class="accented">And many the days to Israel to not have true God, and to not have teaching priest, and to not have Law</span>.

For Azariah may well contemplate his illustration as good from long of old, to the very moment he was speaking. The unfortunate wealth of illustration to hand of his position may pardon the doubtfulness of commentators as to the source from which it may be supposed he would have drawn his most effective instances. It will not be the unlikeliest guide to follow the triple description of the alleged apostasy, misfortune, or iniquity "of Israel," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> (say) it <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the true God</span>; <span class="accented">happened to</span> them <span class="cmt_word">to not have teaching priest</span>; <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the Law</span> (this meaning, to not have it authoritatively proclaimed, taught, ministered). When did these three things <span class="accented">happen</span> altogether most notoriously? They describe, not the transgressions of an individual king, but the state of the people and kingdom as a whole. If it were possible to conceive the description as a flagrant anachronism, a retrospective post-Captivity amplification, which the writer (in his glow of work and thought) was unconsciously and irresistibly betrayed into putting into the lips of the Prophet Azariah, all doubt would end; for the description would suit no state of things and no period better than that of the divided kingdoms, especially applying to the career of the separate kingdom of Israel. Our account, unfortunately, is unchecked just here by a parallel. It is, however, impossible to suppose this without any tittle of external authority for it, much less enough to proceed upon. Some so crave the illustration that they are prepared to suppose all the tenses of these verses present and future rather than past and "present perfect." But, in fact, no doubt the history of Israel since the death of Moses illustrated the language of Azariah <span class="accented">passim</span> to a degree beyond all "that is written" or that we know. And then we may certainly consider theft the expression chosen, "many days" (which some translate "many a day," "many a time "), even the word "years" not being employed, leaves it open to us to go to short episodes of an irreligious and disastrous character in the history of Israel. Lastly, the long stretch of fully three hundred years, extending throughout the Book of Judges (its last five chapters in right order or wrong)into the opening seven chapters of 1 Samuel, provides one running comment, superabundant almost to repetitiousness, for the illustration of our vers. 3-7; in many cases absolutely <span class="accented">picking out</span> the very colours to match (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>; <a href="/judges/20-29.htm">Judges 20:29, 31</a>, compared with our ver. 5). To distinguish and separate the very numerous references that might be made is merely supererogatory, and spoils the unmatched mosaic work of the history (<a href="/judges/2-15.htm">Judges 2:15, 18, 19</a>; <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-15</a>; <a href="/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1-3</a>; <a href="/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6, 19-21, 31</a>: 6:1-5, 7-10; 9:32-37; 10:6-16; 11:19, 20; 12:5, 6; 17:5, 6, 13; 20:29, 31; <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30 -35</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9-22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3, 8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>). It is a long-stretched-out history of a practically atheistic, priest-less, lawless life; divided into narratives of invasion, oppression, servitude (sevenfold, the Mesopotamian, Moabite, Canaanitish, Midianitish, Ammonitish, Philistine, and, it may be added, in order to comprehend all internal strife, Ishmaelitish larger and lesser, yet surprisingly general), smart, cry for help manifestly more the cry of pain and cowardice than of penitence and repentance, resolution and vow, and - for another trial and still another - of Divine pity, forbearance, and deliverance <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
