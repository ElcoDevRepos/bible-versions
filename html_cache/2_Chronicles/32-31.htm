Babylon, at this time, was a rising power, and its interest in Judah suggests the growing influence of King Hezekiah. The visit likely occurred after Hezekiah's miraculous recovery from illness and the defeat of the Assyrians, events that would have drawn international attention. The Babylonian envoys were likely sent by Merodach-Baladan, a king known for his opposition to Assyrian dominance, seeking alliances. This visit is also recorded in <a href="/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12-19</a> and <a href="/isaiah/39.htm">Isaiah 39</a>, highlighting its significance.<p><b>to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land</b><br>The "wonder" refers to the miraculous events surrounding Hezekiah's reign, particularly his healing and the defeat of the Assyrian army. The "wonder" could also include the sign of the sun moving backward, as mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8-11</a>. Such events would have been of great interest to foreign powers, both for their political implications and their demonstration of divine favor. This inquiry reflects the ancient world's fascination with omens and signs, often seen as indicators of divine will.<p><b>God left him alone to test him</b><br>This phrase suggests a divine purpose behind the events, where God allows Hezekiah to act independently to reveal his true character. The concept of God "testing" individuals is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the lives of figures like Abraham (Genesis 22) and Job. It implies a period of trial where one's faith and reliance on God are examined. Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and His interest in the moral and spiritual development of His people.<p><b>that He might know all that was in Hezekiah&#8217;s heart</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of inner motives and the condition of the heart in biblical theology. While God is omniscient, the testing serves to reveal Hezekiah's heart to himself and others. Hezekiah's subsequent actions, showing the Babylonian envoys all his treasures (<a href="/2_kings/20-13.htm">2 Kings 20:13</a>), reveal a lapse in judgment and pride, leading to Isaiah's prophecy of Babylonian captivity. This serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and the importance of humility and reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his reforms to restore proper worship in the kingdom.

But such an inquiry is quite in harmony with what we know of the Babylonians from their own monuments. Babylon was the home of the arts of divination and augury, from observation of all kinds of signs and portents in every department of nature. Moreover, the sign given to Hezekiah would have a special interest for the astrologers and astronomers of the Babylonian temple-towers. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and thus.</span> The italic type dispensed with, the verse may be rendered, <span class="cmt_word">And thus with or among the ambassadors of the princes...
