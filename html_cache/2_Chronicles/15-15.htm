This oath was a renewal of their dedication to the Lord, reminiscent of the covenant renewals seen in the time of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>) and King Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>). The joy reflects a deep spiritual revival and unity among the people, similar to the joy expressed during the dedication of the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-10.htm">2 Chronicles 7:10</a>). This rejoicing indicates a sincere and heartfelt return to God, which is a recurring theme in the history of Israel.<p><b>for they had sworn it with all their heart</b><br>The sincerity of their oath is emphasized by the phrase "with all their heart," indicating a complete and undivided commitment to God. This wholehearted devotion is a key biblical principle, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>), which calls for loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. The wholeheartedness of their commitment contrasts with previous periods of half-hearted worship and idolatry, highlighting a significant spiritual transformation.<p><b>They had sought Him earnestly</b><br>The earnest seeking of God by the people of Judah reflects a genuine desire for His presence and guidance. This earnestness is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, which promises that those who seek God with all their heart will find Him. The seeking of God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6-7</a>).<p><b>and He was found by them</b><br>The finding of God by the people signifies His faithfulness in responding to those who earnestly seek Him. This concept is supported by the promise in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a> that God will be found by those who seek Him with all their heart and soul. It underscores the relational aspect of the covenant, where God is not distant but accessible to His people when they turn to Him in sincerity.<p><b>So the LORD gave them rest on every side</b><br>The rest given by the LORD is a fulfillment of His covenant promises, providing peace and security to the nation. This rest is reminiscent of the peace experienced during the reigns of David and Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24-25</a>) and is a sign of God's blessing and favor. The concept of rest is also a type of the ultimate rest found in Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers enter into God's rest through faith. The peace on every side indicates a period of stability and prosperity, allowing the people to focus on worship and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
