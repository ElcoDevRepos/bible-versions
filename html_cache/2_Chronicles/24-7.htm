Athaliah married Jehoram, king of Judah, and brought her family's idolatrous practices with her. Her influence led to the promotion of Baal worship in Judah. The "sons" here likely refers to her descendants or followers who continued her idolatrous practices. Athaliah's reign was marked by violence and the usurpation of the throne, as she attempted to eliminate the Davidic line by killing her own grandchildren, except for Joash, who was hidden and later became king.<p><b>had broken into the house of God</b><br>The "house of God" refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, which was the center of worship for the Israelites and the dwelling place of God's presence. Breaking into the Temple signifies a profound act of desecration and disrespect for the sacred space dedicated to Yahweh. This act reflects the spiritual decline and apostasy in Judah during Athaliah's influence, as the Temple was meant to be a place of holiness and reverence.<p><b>and had even used the sacred objects of the house of the LORD</b><br>The sacred objects in the Temple included items such as the altar, the lampstand, and various utensils used in worship and sacrifices. These objects were consecrated for the service of Yahweh and were not to be used for any other purpose. The misuse of these items indicates a blatant disregard for the sanctity of the Temple and the worship of God. It also highlights the extent of corruption and idolatry that had infiltrated Judah under Athaliah's rule.<p><b>for the Baals</b><br>Baal was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility, storms, and agriculture. Worship of Baal often involved rituals that were abhorrent to the worship of Yahweh, including child sacrifice and sexual immorality. The use of sacred Temple objects for Baal worship represents a syncretism that was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law. This act of idolatry was a direct violation of the first commandment, which prohibited the worship of other gods. The narrative underscores the spiritual crisis in Judah and sets the stage for the reforms that Joash would later implement to restore true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, Athaliah was the queen mother of Judah who usurped the throne after the death of her son, King Ahaziah.
