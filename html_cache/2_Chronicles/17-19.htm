Jehoshaphat, the fourth king of Judah, was known for his religious reforms and efforts to strengthen the kingdom militarily and spiritually. The men who served the king were likely part of a well-organized army, reflecting the king's commitment to national security and stability. This military organization can be seen as a continuation of the efforts of previous kings like David and Solomon, who also maintained strong armies. The service to the king can be seen as a type of service to God, as the king was considered God's representative on earth.<p><b>besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah</b><br>This part of the verse highlights Jehoshaphat's strategic military planning. Fortified cities were crucial for defense against invasions, and their mention indicates a network of strongholds throughout Judah. These cities served as military and administrative centers, ensuring the kingdom's security and stability. The practice of stationing troops in fortified cities was common in the ancient Near East, reflecting the geopolitical realities of the time. This strategy is reminiscent of the fortified cities established by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-19</a>) and Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12</a>).

The phrase highlights that God records individual faithfulness, not just totals.<p>&#8226; It also reminds readers that the kingdom&#8217;s strength is rooted in real people whose courage God honors.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who served the king</b><p>&#8226; Service here is direct, personal loyalty to King Jehoshaphat, echoing earlier examples such as Ittai&#8217;s pledge to David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a>) and the bodyguard around Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a>).<p>&#8226; The text underscores proper order: warriors submit to God-appointed leadership (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By tying military might to royal service, the chronicler stresses unity under righteous authority (cf. 1 Chron 27:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Besides those he stationed</b><p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s army is larger than the headline numbers; the king also maintains garrisons.<p>&#8226; This mirrors Asa&#8217;s fortification program (2 Chron 14:6-8) and Rehoboam&#8217;s earlier defenses (2 Chron 11:11-12).<p>&#8226; Wise stewardship prepares for threats without presuming on past victories (<a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the fortified cities</b><p>&#8226; Fortified cities&#8212;strategic strongholds like Hebron, Bethlehem, and Lachish&#8212;guard trade routes and borders (2 Chron 11:5-10).<p>&#8226; The phrase shows balance: a mobile army plus fixed defenses (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8226; These fortifications also symbolize God&#8217;s protection over His people (<a href="/psalms/48-12.htm">Psalm 48:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Throughout Judah</b><p>&#8226; Distribution &#8220;throughout Judah&#8221; means every tribe and village benefits, echoing Jehoshaphat&#8217;s earlier tour to teach the Law in all towns (2 Chron 17:9).<p>&#8226; National security is tied to nationwide righteousness; Jehoshaphat later visits the people again to encourage justice (2 Chron 19:4-5).<p>&#8226; The chronicler invites readers to see unity and shared responsibility, resonating with Moses&#8217; call for worship &#8220;at the place the LORD will choose&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>), binding the land together under one Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/17-19.htm">2 Chronicles 17:19</a> caps a detailed troop roster by noting that Jehoshaphat&#8217;s standing army was only part of his defense; additional soldiers guarded fortified cities spread across Judah.

The totals are the largest assigned to the two tribes anywhere in the Old Testament; viz., Judah 780,000, and Benjamin 380,000; in all, 1,160,000. At David's census Judah had 500,000 warriors (<a href="/2_samuel/24-9.htm" title="And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.">2Samuel 24:9</a>); and Israel 800,000. Again, in <a href="/2_chronicles/14-8.htm" title="And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.">2Chronicles 14:8</a>, Asa's army consists of 300,000 men of Judah and 280,000 Benjaminites: clearly such an increase as our text indicates is unaccountable. At the same time, it is equally clear that the present numbers are not fortuitous results of clerical errors, for they follow each other in the order of relative strength: Judah, 300,000, 280,000, 200,000; Benjamin, 200,000, 180,000; and they are evidently not independent of the estimates of <a href="/2_chronicles/14-8.htm" title="And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.">2Chronicles 14:8</a> above quoted. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These waited</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, plur. piel part. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>.
