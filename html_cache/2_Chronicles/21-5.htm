This age suggests a level of maturity and experience, as he likely had been involved in the affairs of the kingdom under his father's reign. Jehoshaphat was a king who sought to follow the ways of the Lord, and it is possible that Jehoram was exposed to these teachings. However, Jehoram's reign marked a departure from his father's faithfulness. The age of thirty-two is significant in biblical numerology, often associated with leadership and authority. Jehoram's ascension to the throne was also marked by the elimination of his brothers, which was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern monarchies to secure one's rule, though it was contrary to the covenantal ethics of Israel.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was not only the political center but also the spiritual heart of the nation, housing the Temple built by Solomon. Jehoram's reign in Jerusalem signifies his central role in the leadership of God's chosen people. The city was a symbol of God's presence and covenant with Israel. However, Jehoram's reign was characterized by idolatry and alliances with the northern kingdom of Israel, which led to spiritual decline. This period in Jerusalem's history is marked by a departure from the Davidic covenant, as Jehoram introduced the worship of foreign gods, influenced by his marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel.<p><b>eight years</b><br>Jehoram's reign lasted eight years, a relatively short period compared to other kings of Judah. The number eight in biblical terms often signifies a new beginning or a new order, but in Jehoram's case, it marked a period of turmoil and decline. His reign was plagued by internal strife, foreign invasions, and divine judgment, as prophesied by Elijah. The brevity of his reign can be seen as a consequence of his unfaithfulness to God, contrasting with the longer, more prosperous reigns of kings who followed the Lord. Jehoram's death was ignominious, and he was not buried in the tombs of the kings, reflecting the negative impact of his rule on the nation of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The son of Jehoshaphat, Jehoram became king of Judah.
