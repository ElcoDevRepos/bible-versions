Asa was known for his initial faithfulness to God, implementing religious reforms and seeking the Lord's guidance in earlier battles (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2-5</a>). The thirty-ninth year marks a period of decline in his spiritual life, highlighting the dangers of complacency and self-reliance over time.<p><b>Asa became diseased in his feet</b><br>The specific mention of a disease in Asa's feet may symbolize a loss of stability or foundation, as feet are often associated with one's walk or journey in life. This physical ailment could reflect a spiritual condition, as Asa's reliance on God had waned. In biblical times, diseases were often seen as a consequence of sin or a test of faith, prompting individuals to seek divine intervention.<p><b>and his disease became increasingly severe</b><br>The progression of Asa's disease underscores the seriousness of his condition and the urgency for divine intervention. This mirrors the spiritual principle that unresolved sin or lack of faith can lead to worsening consequences. The increasing severity of his ailment serves as a metaphor for the escalating spiritual decline when one turns away from God.<p><b>Yet even in his illness he did not seek the LORD</b><br>This phrase highlights Asa's failure to turn to God in his time of need, contrasting with his earlier reliance on the Lord during military threats (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>). It serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of maintaining faith and seeking God in all circumstances, not just in times of crisis. Theologically, it emphasizes the necessity of a consistent relationship with God.<p><b>but only the physicians</b><br>In the ancient Near East, physicians were often consulted for physical ailments, but their practices were limited compared to modern medicine. Asa's exclusive reliance on physicians, rather than seeking God, indicates a misplaced trust in human wisdom over divine power. This reflects a broader biblical theme where reliance on human strength or wisdom is often contrasted with faith in God (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-8</a>). The narrative serves as a reminder of the ultimate authority and healing power of God, foreshadowing the New Testament emphasis on Jesus as the Great Physician (<a href="/mark/2-17.htm">Mark 2:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his initial faithfulness to God and religious reforms, but later in life, he relied more on human wisdom than divine guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, over which Asa reigned.

After decades of blessing, the king turns to human alliances, silences prophetic correction, and finally leans solely on physicians. The literal historical account teaches that unrepentant compromise invites escalating consequences, while ignoring God in favor of human solutions leaves the heart&#8212;and often the body&#8212;unhealed. Seek Him first, trust Him fully, and let every remedy be received with faith in the Great Physician.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Diseased in his feet.</span>--<a href="/1_kings/15-23.htm" title="The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

Asa, like Ahaziah, neglected to consult Jehovah through his priests, and preferred to trust in the "Healers" of his day, whose art of healing probably consisted in the use of magical appliances, such as amulets, charms, and exorcisms, as we may infer from the analogous practices of Babylon and Assyria.
