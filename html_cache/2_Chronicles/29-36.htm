This phrase highlights the collective joy of both the leader and the people, indicating a unified response to God's work. The rejoicing reflects a deep spiritual renewal and a return to covenant faithfulness. This mirrors other biblical instances where leaders and people together celebrate God's intervention, such as in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah.<p><b>at what God had prepared for the people</b><br>This preparation refers to the restoration of the temple and the reestablishment of proper worship practices. It underscores the belief that God orchestrates events for His purposes, aligning with the biblical theme of divine providence. The preparation can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to His people, reminiscent of how God prepared the way for Israel's return from exile.<p><b>because everything had been accomplished so quickly</b><br>The rapid accomplishment of these reforms suggests divine assistance and favor. It emphasizes the efficiency and effectiveness of Hezekiah's leadership, but ultimately attributes the success to God's intervention. This swift completion can be compared to other instances in scripture where God's plans unfold rapidly, such as the sudden deliverance of Peter from prison in <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>.
