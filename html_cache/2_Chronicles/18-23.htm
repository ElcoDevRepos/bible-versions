In the context of ancient Israel, prophets often served in the royal court, providing counsel to kings. Zedekiah's actions here are in direct opposition to Micaiah, a true prophet of God, highlighting the tension between true and false prophecy.<p><b>struck Micaiah in the face</b><br>This act of violence against Micaiah symbolizes the rejection and persecution of true prophets throughout biblical history. Striking someone in the face was a grave insult and an attempt to discredit Micaiah's prophecy. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God's messengers faced hostility, such as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>) and Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>).<p><b>and demanded, &#8220;Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go</b><br>Zedekiah's question is sarcastic and rhetorical, challenging Micaiah's claim to have received a true message from God. The Spirit of the LORD is often associated with divine inspiration and truth, as seen in the anointing of prophets and kings (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). Zedekiah's question implies doubt about Micaiah's prophetic authority.<p><b>when He departed from me to speak with you?&#8221;</b><br>Zedekiah assumes that he, too, has the Spirit of the LORD, reflecting the common belief that prophets were vessels of divine communication. His question underscores the conflict between competing prophetic messages. This situation is reminiscent of the confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18), where the true prophet of God is vindicated. The departure of the Spirit from Zedekiah to Micaiah suggests a transfer of divine favor and truth, prefiguring the ultimate revelation of God's word through Jesus Christ, who is the true and final prophet (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah_son_of_chenaanah.htm">Zedekiah son of Chenaanah</a></b><br>A false prophet who opposed Micaiah and supported King Ahab's plans.

<a href="/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>).<p>&#8226; His &#8220;going up&#8221; is literal&#8212;stepping forward in the royal court&#8212;and symbolic, showing a self-appointed elevation of his authority. Compare other self-exalting false prophets such as Hananiah confronting Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/28-10.htm">Jeremiah 28:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently warns that many will claim prophetic status while lacking God&#8217;s endorsement (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>).

Among many possible suggestions as to the exact meaning of the question, "Which way," etc.? it is possible that a sceptical taunt best explains Zedekiah's words, and that he meant that he did not believe the Spirit of the Lord went <span class="accented">any</span> way to Micaiah. He will not yield to a doubt or to a suspicion thrown upon it that the Spirit had been with himself, and he will fain throw great doubt, whether he had proceeded from him to Micaiah! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/18-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Zedekiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;i&#7695;&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6667.htm">Strong's 6667: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zedekiah -- 'Yah is righteousness', six Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1462;&#1469;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;en-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Chenaanah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;na&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3668.htm">Strong's 3668: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chenaanah -- two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went up,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yig&#183;ga&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
