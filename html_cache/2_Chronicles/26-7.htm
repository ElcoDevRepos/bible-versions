In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/26.htm">2 Chronicles 26</a>, it refers to King Uzziah of Judah, who reigned during a time of prosperity and military success. The assistance from God underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience often resulted in divine favor. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>, where Samuel sets up a stone called Ebenezer, saying, "Thus far the LORD has helped us."<p><b>against the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a significant adversarial group to Israel, often mentioned throughout the Old Testament. They inhabited the coastal regions of Canaan and were known for their advanced iron technology and formidable military presence. Uzziah's victories over the Philistines would have been seen as a continuation of the struggle that began in the time of the Judges and continued through the reigns of Saul and David. This victory is reminiscent of David's triumphs over the Philistines, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>, where David defeats Goliath, a Philistine giant.<p><b>against the Arabs living in Gur-baal</b><br>The Arabs mentioned here likely refer to nomadic tribes inhabiting the desert regions southeast of Judah. Gur-baal is a location not extensively detailed in biblical texts, but it is thought to be a region where these tribes resided. The mention of Arabs indicates the broader geopolitical challenges faced by Uzziah, as he had to secure his kingdom's borders against various groups. This reflects the historical context of the time, where regional powers often clashed over territory and resources.<p><b>and against the Meunites</b><br>The Meunites, also known as the Maonites, were a group mentioned in the Old Testament as living in the region south of Judah. They are associated with the Edomites and are mentioned in other passages, such as <a href="/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1</a>, where they join forces against King Jehoshaphat of Judah. Uzziah's success against the Meunites would have been part of his broader campaign to secure Judah's southern borders. This victory can be seen as part of God's promise to protect and establish Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, where God promises to defeat the enemies of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his military successes and innovations. His reign was marked by prosperity and strength, attributed to his faithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel and Judah, often at war with them. They were a powerful group located in the coastal region of Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/arabs_of_gurbaal.htm">Arabs of Gurbaal</a></b><br>A group of people living in the region of Gurbaal, likely a desert area. They were adversaries of Judah during Uzziah's reign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/meunites.htm">Meunites</a></b><br>Another group that opposed Judah. They are mentioned in the context of Uzziah's military campaigns and victories.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_help.htm">God's Help</a></b><br>The divine assistance provided to Uzziah, which was crucial for his victories over these adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god_for_victory.htm">Dependence on God for Victory</a></b><br>Uzziah's success was not due to his own strength but because he relied on God. In our lives, we should remember that true victory comes from God, not our own efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_god.htm">The Importance of Seeking God</a></b><br>Uzziah's prosperity was linked to his seeking of God. We should prioritize our relationship with God, knowing that He guides and supports those who earnestly seek Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">God's Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Just as God helped Uzziah against formidable enemies, He remains faithful to help us in our struggles. Trusting in God's faithfulness can bring peace and confidence in difficult times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The battles Uzziah faced can be likened to spiritual battles we encounter. <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a> reminds us that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, and we need God's help to overcome.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_26_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 26:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chronicles_26_7_God_s_support_shown.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 26:7 demonstrate God's support for righteous leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_did_God_aid_against_Philistines.htm">What actions led to God's help against the Philistines in 2 Chronicles 26:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_help_today.htm">How can we seek God's assistance in our battles today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Biblical_examples_of_God_aiding_His_people.htm">What other biblical examples show God helping His people against enemies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Uzziah_s_faith_to_our_challenges.htm">How can we apply Uzziah's reliance on God to our personal challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_26_7_God_s_support_for_leaders.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 26:7 demonstrate God's support for righteous leaders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_2_Chronicles_26_7_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in 2 Chronicles 26:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/God_s_role_in_2_Chron_26_7_victory.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 26:7 reflect God's role in military victories?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_26.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_being_outside_paradise.htm">Who were the Meunites in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_were_the_meunites_in_the_bible.htm">Who were the Meunites in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_many_baths_did_solomon_build.htm">Solomon built a facility containing how many baths?
