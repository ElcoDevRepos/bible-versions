The phrase indicates divine favor and presence, a recurring theme in the Old Testament where God's presence signifies blessing and guidance. This divine companionship is reminiscent of God's promise to be with those who follow His commandments, as seen with figures like Moses and Joshua. The LORD's presence with Jehoshaphat suggests a period of peace and prosperity for Judah, contrasting with the turmoil often experienced by the northern kingdom of Israel.<p><b>because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David.</b><br>This phrase highlights Jehoshaphat's adherence to the godly practices of King David, who is often regarded as the ideal king of Israel. David's "earlier ways" refer to his devotion to God before his later moral failings. Jehoshaphat's commitment to these ways implies a return to pure worship and governance, aligning with the covenantal ideals established by David. This connection to David also emphasizes the Davidic line's importance in Judah's history and foreshadows the Messianic lineage, which Christians believe culminates in Jesus Christ.<p><b>He did not seek the Baals,</b><br>The Baals were Canaanite deities associated with fertility and weather, often worshipped by Israel's neighbors and, at times, by the Israelites themselves. Jehoshaphat's rejection of Baal worship signifies a clear stance against idolatry, aligning with the first commandment to have no other gods. This decision reflects a commitment to monotheism and the exclusive worship of Yahweh, setting Jehoshaphat apart from many of his contemporaries who fell into syncretism. His actions echo the reforms of other faithful kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who also sought to purify worship in Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is depicted as being with Jehoshaphat due to his faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his role as a model of faithfulness, despite his imperfections.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/baals.htm">Baals</a></b><br>Canaanite deities that were often worshipped by the surrounding nations and sometimes by the Israelites, representing a departure from the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jehoshaphat reigned and implemented his reforms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god_brings_his_presence.htm">Faithfulness to God Brings His Presence</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's commitment to walking in the ways of David, a man after God's own heart, resulted in the Lord's presence with him.

Just as &#8220;the LORD was with Joseph&#8221; and prospered him in <a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2&#8211;3</a>, and as David &#8220;had success in all his ways, for the LORD was with him&#8221; in <a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>, so Jehoshaphat enjoys tangible evidence of divine favor. When Scripture says the LORD &#8220;was with&#8221; someone, it marks a covenant faithfulness that turns ordinary leadership into God-blessed leadership. Notice how Battles were won (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>), reforms advanced (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4</a>), and peace reigned on his borders (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10</a>)&#8212;all downstream from this one reality: God was present and acting on his behalf.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David</b><p>Jehoshaphat patterned his life after the best years of David&#8217;s reign, before David&#8217;s later missteps. Those &#8220;earlier ways&#8221; included:<p>&#8226; wholehearted trust in God (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>)<p>&#8226; consistent worship centred on the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12&#8211;15</a>)<p>&#8226; justice and righteousness in leadership (<a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>)<p>By emulating these priorities, Jehoshaphat aligned himself with the covenant expectations laid out in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>. Such obedience is never forgotten by God (<a href="/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>). The text underscores that our choices position us either under blessing or under discipline; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s deliberate imitation of David&#8217;s early faithfulness invited God&#8217;s companionship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He did not seek the Baals</b><p>In the northern kingdom, Ahab and Jezebel aggressively promoted Baal worship (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31&#8211;33</a>), but Jehoshaphat decisively rejected that cultural current. To &#8220;seek&#8221; Baal meant more than casual curiosity&#8212;it implied dependence for rain, crops, and fertility (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11&#8211;13</a>). By refusing, Jehoshaphat upheld the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a>) and kept Judah from the spiritual adultery that plagued Israel (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>). His stance reminds us that loyalty to God often requires counter-cultural choices, a theme echoed in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>&#8217;s call not to conform to the world.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Idolatry is not merely ancient history; any rival source of security can become a modern &#8220;Baal.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Purity of worship safeguards a nation and a life; compromise opens doors to judgment (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-18.htm">2 Chronicles 24:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s refusal prepared the ground for revival under later reforms (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3</a> links God&#8217;s presence to Jehoshaphat&#8217;s obedience: he patterned himself after David&#8217;s best example and firmly rejected idolatry, so the LORD actively walked with him.
