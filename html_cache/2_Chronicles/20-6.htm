The "God of our fathers" refers to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, emphasizing the covenant relationship established with the patriarchs. This invocation is a reminder of God's faithfulness throughout history and His ongoing relationship with His people. It reflects a deep sense of tradition and reliance on the God who has been with Israel through generations.<p><b>are You not the God who is in heaven,</b><br>This phrase highlights God's transcendence and sovereignty. By acknowledging God as the one "who is in heaven," it emphasizes His supreme authority and position above all earthly powers. This is consistent with biblical themes found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where heaven is described as God's throne. It underscores the belief that God is not limited by earthly constraints and rules from a position of ultimate authority.<p><b>and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations?</b><br>Here, the focus is on God's dominion over all earthly kingdoms, not just Israel. This reflects the biblical theme of God's universal sovereignty, as seen in <a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>, where it is declared that "the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth." It serves as a reminder that all nations are under God's control, and His plans and purposes will prevail regardless of human actions.<p><b>Power and might are in Your hand,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's omnipotence. The imagery of power and might being in God's hand suggests His ability to execute His will and intervene in human affairs. It is a declaration of trust in God's strength, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>, which states, "Power belongs to God." This assurance of divine power is a source of comfort and confidence for believers facing challenges.<p><b>and no one can stand against You.</b><br>The final phrase asserts God's invincibility. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, "If God is for us, who can be against us?" This is a declaration of faith in God's ultimate victory over any opposition. It reassures believers that no force, whether human or spiritual, can thwart God's purposes. This confidence in God's protection and victory is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, providing hope and encouragement to the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the nation in seeking God's help against a vast enemy coalition.

Jehoshaphat reminds the people that their crisis is fully visible to a God who never miscalculates.<p>&#8226; Because this God is literally &#8220;in heaven,&#8221; His authority is not regional or tribal; it is unlimited and unchallenged.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ruler over all kingdoms of the nations</b><p>&#8226; The king confesses that every earthly government sits under divine sovereignty (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Even the hostile coalition marching against Judah answers, in the end, to God&#8217;s decree.<p>&#8226; This truth steers prayer away from fear and toward confident dependence: if God rules the nations, He rules the crisis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Power and might are in Your hand</b><p>&#8226; Omnipotence is not theoretical; it resides &#8220;in Your hand,&#8221; an expression of active, personal strength (<a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat doesn&#8217;t appeal to luck, strategy, or numbers but to a hand that has already split seas, toppled walls, and silenced lions.<p>&#8226; By acknowledging divine power, he implicitly renounces self-reliance, echoing the principle of <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>&#8212;human weakness is the stage for God&#8217;s strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No one can stand against You</b><p>&#8226; The king concludes with a declaration of God&#8217;s invincibility. <a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a> affirms, &#8220;I know that You can do all things; no purpose of Yours can be thwarted,&#8221; and <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a> asks, &#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Every opposing army, king, or spiritual force collapses before the Lord&#8217;s unassailable will (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This final line turns the focus from the enemy&#8217;s size to God&#8217;s supremacy, reinforcing faith before the battle even starts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a> is a model prayer that shifts eyes from looming danger to the Lord&#8217;s proven character.
