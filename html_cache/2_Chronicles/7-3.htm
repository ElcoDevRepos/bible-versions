This event parallels the fire that consumed the sacrifices on the altar during the dedication of the tabernacle in <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>. It demonstrates God's presence and approval, a powerful sign to the Israelites that their worship was accepted. The fire from heaven is a recurring biblical motif, symbolizing divine presence and approval, as seen in Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>.<p><b>and the glory of the LORD above the temple</b><br>The glory of the LORD, often referred to as the Shekinah glory, represents God's manifest presence. This glory filled the temple, indicating that God had taken residence among His people. The concept of God's glory is central to the Old Testament, appearing in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>) and later in the temple. It foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God's glory in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory.<p><b>they bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground</b><br>This act of bowing down is a physical expression of worship, reverence, and submission to God. It reflects the cultural practice of showing deep respect and humility before a sovereign. The pavement, likely made of costly stones, signifies the sacred space of the temple courtyard. Bowing with faces to the ground is a common biblical posture of worship, seen in other instances such as in <a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a> when Abram fell on his face before God.<p><b>and they worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD</b><br>Worship and thanksgiving are central themes in the relationship between God and His people. The Israelites' response to God's presence is one of adoration and gratitude, acknowledging His sovereignty and goodness. This act of worship is not just ritualistic but a heartfelt response to God's faithfulness and mercy. The Psalms frequently emphasize worship and thanksgiving, as seen in <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>, which calls believers to enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise.<p><b>&#8220;For He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is a recurring refrain in the Psalms, notably in <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>, which emphasizes God's enduring mercy and steadfast love. The phrase underscores the character of God as inherently good and faithful. His loving devotion, or hesed in Hebrew, is a covenantal love that remains constant despite human unfaithfulness. This statement of God's goodness and enduring love is a foundational truth for the Israelites and is echoed throughout Scripture, affirming God's unchanging nature and His eternal commitment to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who witnessed the divine manifestation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fire_from_heaven.htm">Fire from Heaven</a></b><br>A miraculous sign of God's presence and approval, symbolizing His holiness and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/glory_of_the_lord.htm">Glory of the LORD</a></b><br>The visible manifestation of God's presence, often associated with His majesty and holiness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem built by Solomon as a dwelling place for God's name and a center for worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pavement.htm">Pavement</a></b><br>The ground area where the Israelites prostrated themselves in worship, signifying humility and reverence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_manifest_presence.htm">God's Manifest Presence</a></b><br>Recognize that God's presence is both awe-inspiring and comforting.
