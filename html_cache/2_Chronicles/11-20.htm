Maacah is identified as the daughter of Absalom, who was the son of King David. Absalom is known for his rebellion against his father David, which adds a layer of complexity to the political alliances formed through marriage. Marriages during this time were often strategic, aimed at strengthening political ties and consolidating power. The mention of Maacah being Absalom's daughter suggests a continuation of the Davidic line, which is significant in the context of the Messianic prophecies that speak of a ruler from David's lineage.<p><b>and she bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith</b><br>Maacah bore Rehoboam four children, with Abijah being the most notable among them. Abijah, also known as Abijam, would later become king of Judah after Rehoboam. His reign is recorded in <a href="/1_kings/15.htm">1 Kings 15</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/13.htm">2 Chronicles 13</a>, where he is depicted as a king who, despite his shortcomings, maintained the Davidic line. The other children, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith, are less prominent in the biblical narrative, but their mention indicates the continuation of the family line and the potential for future alliances and political maneuvers.

Scripture records he eventually had eighteen wives and sixty concubines (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>), echoing Solomon&#8217;s pattern and brushing up against <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, where Israel&#8217;s kings are warned not to multiply wives. The Chronicler&#8217;s simple time&#8208;marker reminds us how Rehoboam&#8217;s domestic choices&#8212;stacked one after another&#8212;contributed to the divided loyalties and spiritual drift later criticized in <a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1-2</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he married Maacah daughter of Absalom</b><p>Maacah (called &#8220;Michaiah&#8221; in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>) is identified with Absalom&#8217;s line, probably his granddaughter through Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a>). Rehoboam&#8217;s marriage into Absalom&#8217;s branch of David&#8217;s family tree served at least two aims:<p>&#8226; political consolidation inside Judah&#8217;s royal clan (compare <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13&#8211;15</a>, where Absalom&#8217;s earlier rebellion had fractured the house of David)<p>&#8226; confirmation that the Messianic promise still flows through David&#8217;s descendants despite past turmoil (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p>Yet this strategic alliance also sowed seeds of compromise&#8212;Maacah later influenced court idolatry that Asa had to remove (<a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she bore to him Abijah</b><p>Abijah (&#8220;my father is Yah&#8221;) would succeed Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-16.htm">2 Chronicles 12:16</a>). Though he reigned only three years, God granted him victory over Jeroboam because he appealed to the covenant promises (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-18</a>). His birth therefore signals:<p>&#8226; continuity of the Davidic line despite Judah&#8217;s spiritual ups and downs;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness to His word even when leaders are inconsistent (see <a href="/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Attai</b><p>Scripture offers no further narrative about Attai beyond this verse, yet the Holy Spirit still records his name. That quiet inclusion:<p>&#8226; affirms every individual&#8217;s worth in God&#8217;s redemptive story (compare the lesser-known names honored in <a href="/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5-65</a>);<p>&#8226; hints at the wider royal household Rehoboam fathered, which carried social, financial, and spiritual implications for Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ziza</b><p>Like Attai, Ziza remains a name without additional chronicles. Still, paired with <a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>&#8217;s note that Rehoboam &#8220;dispersed some of his sons&#8230; to every fortified city,&#8221; it helps illustrate:<p>&#8226; the practical strategy of stationing royal sons as local governors to secure the kingdom;<p>&#8226; the potential for rivalry and fragmentation that such a large family could cause (for a cautionary example, see the infighting among Gideon&#8217;s sons in <a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Shelomith</b><p>Shelomith stems from shalom, &#8220;peace.&#8221; Though little is told about him, the name itself whispers God&#8217;s desire for peace in a time of division. Judah was already split from Israel (<a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/10.htm">2 Chronicles 10</a>), and peace would be fragile. Shelomith&#8217;s naming testifies that:<p>&#8226; parents can still voice faith-filled hopes in turbulent times (<a href="/psalms/29-11.htm">Psalm 29:11</a>);<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant with David ultimately aims toward a prince of peace, fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a> is more than a genealogical footnote. Each phrase highlights the unfolding of God&#8217;s covenant through imperfect people: Rehoboam&#8217;s second marriage extends David&#8217;s line; Maacah&#8217;s identity ties the present to past rebellions; Abijah&#8217;s birth secures succession; the lesser-known sons show God&#8217;s care for every name; and Shelomith&#8217;s &#8220;peace&#8221; points forward to the lasting peace only the future Son of David can give.
