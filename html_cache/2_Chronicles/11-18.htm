His marriage to Mahalath is significant as it reflects the continuation of alliances within the royal family. Marriages during this time were often strategic, aimed at strengthening political ties and consolidating power. This union would have been seen as a way to maintain the Davidic lineage and ensure loyalty among the tribes of Judah.<p><b>who was the daughter of David&#8217;s son Jerimoth</b><br>Jerimoth is a lesser-known son of David, not prominently featured in the biblical narrative. His mention here highlights the extensive family network of David, which played a crucial role in the political landscape of Israel and Judah. The inclusion of Jerimoth's lineage emphasizes the importance of maintaining connections within the house of David, which was central to the identity and legitimacy of the Judean kingship.<p><b>and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse&#8217;s son Eliab</b><br>Abihail, being the daughter of Eliab, connects Mahalath to another branch of David's family. Eliab was David's eldest brother, and his mention here underscores the interwoven relationships within the family of Jesse. This connection to Eliab, who was initially considered for kingship before David, reinforces the theme of divine choice and the unexpected ways God fulfills His promises. The marriage of Rehoboam to Mahalath, therefore, not only strengthens familial bonds but also serves as a reminder of God's sovereign plan through the house of Jesse.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, known for his role in the division of the united kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mahalath.htm">Mahalath</a></b><br>The wife of Rehoboam, described as the daughter of Jerimoth and Abihail, linking her to the royal lineage of David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerimoth.htm">Jerimoth</a></b><br>A lesser-known son of David, indicating the extensive family connections within the royal lineage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abihail.htm">Abihail</a></b><br>The mother of Mahalath, connected to the family of Jesse, David's father, through her father Eliab.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliab.htm">Eliab</a></b><br>The eldest son of Jesse, making him David's brother and part of the extended family network that played a role in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_family_lineage.htm">The Importance of Family Lineage</a></b><br>The verse highlights the significance of family connections in biblical times, especially within royal and priestly lines.

This act is more than personal romance; it is a deliberate step to solidify his legitimacy among the people left under his rule.<p>&#8226; By marrying inside the covenant line, he underscores continuity with God&#8217;s promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>).<p>&#8226; It also answers a practical need. Judah and Benjamin are all he has; bonding with a daughter of David&#8217;s house helps weld those tribes together (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-1.htm">2 Chronicles 11:1, 23</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture elsewhere warns kings not to multiply foreign wives lest their hearts be led astray (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>). Here, at least, Rehoboam begins with a marriage that honors national and covenant identity.<p>Yet <a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a> notes he eventually gathered many wives, a drift that later mirrored Solomon&#8217;s weakness (<a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was the daughter of David&#8217;s son Jerimoth</b><p>Jerimoth is listed among David&#8217;s sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1-8</a>). Though not prominent in the historical narratives, his place in the genealogy matters:<p>&#8226; Mahalath is David&#8217;s granddaughter, linking Rehoboam to the king after God&#8217;s own heart (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This keeps the royal seed pure and highlights God&#8217;s meticulous preservation of the Messianic line (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds readers that even &#8220;minor&#8221; family members serve major roles in God&#8217;s unfolding plan; no piece of Scripture&#8217;s genealogy is accidental.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and of Abihail</b><p>Abihail, Mahalath&#8217;s mother, is named to show the maternal branch that feeds into the same spiritual heritage. God often records a woman&#8217;s lineage when it contributes to covenant history (cf. <a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13-17</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Her inclusion credits the influence of godly mothers and grandmothers (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; It also doubles the testimony: both paternal and maternal lines connect to Jesse&#8217;s house, underscoring the thoroughness of God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Marriage &#8220;in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>) is a timeless principle; Abihail&#8217;s place illustrates how families can unite around shared faith rather than mere politics.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the daughter of Jesse&#8217;s son Eliab</b><p>Eliab was Jesse&#8217;s firstborn, the one Samuel initially thought would be king before the Lord chose David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; By noting Eliab, the text circles back to Judah&#8217;s ancestral roots. Rehoboam&#8217;s bride is not just Davidic; she carries the broader Jesse lineage.<p>&#8226; This strengthens tribal solidarity in Judah after ten tribes broke away under Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16-20</a>).<p>&#8226; It displays God&#8217;s providence: even the brother passed over for the throne (Eliab) contributes to the royal future through his granddaughter. Nothing in God&#8217;s plan is wasted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/11-18.htm">2 Chronicles 11:18</a> records more than a wedding announcement. Each family name&#8212;Rehoboam, Mahalath, Jerimoth, Abihail, Eliab, Jesse&#8212;threads the needle of covenant promises, political necessity, and personal faithfulness. The verse shows Rehoboam initially anchoring his reign to David&#8217;s legacy, fulfilling God&#8217;s meticulous preservation of the Messianic line, and reinforcing Judah&#8217;s identity after national rupture. Scripture&#8217;s precision in listing these relationships assures us that God oversees every detail, weaving even family ties into His unbreakable redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">PARTICULAES CONCERNING REHOBOAM'S FAMILY</span><p>(<a href="/context/2_chronicles/11-18.htm" title="And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;">2Chronicles 11:18-23</a>).<p>This record also is wanting in the Book of Kings.

It is not quite clear whether Abihail were wife of Jerimoth and mother of Mahalath, or a second wife now mentioned of Rehoboam. The contents of the next verse not differencing the children there mentioned, and assigning her own to each wife of Rehoboam, if these were two wives of his, favours the former supposition (our Hebrew text being "and she <span class="accented">bare</span>," not "which bare").
