This opulence is reminiscent of the feasts described in <a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22-23</a>, where daily provisions for Solomon's court are detailed. The lavishness of the table signifies not only material wealth but also the wisdom and order Solomon brought to his administration, as seen in the peace and prosperity of his reign.<p><b>the seating of his servants</b><br>The organized seating of Solomon's servants indicates a well-structured and hierarchical court system. This orderliness reflects the wisdom Solomon was renowned for, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/10-4.htm">1 Kings 10:4-5</a>. The seating arrangement also suggests a society where roles and duties were clearly defined, contributing to the efficient functioning of the kingdom. This mirrors the order God desires in His creation, as seen in the structured worship and service in the tabernacle and temple.<p><b>the service and attire of his attendants</b><br>The service and attire of Solomon's attendants highlight the splendor and dignity of his court. The attendants' attire would have been rich and elaborate, signifying the honor and respect due to the king. This grandeur is a type of the heavenly court, where service to God is conducted with reverence and majesty. The attire also points to the righteousness and purity required of those who serve in God's presence, as seen in the priestly garments described in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>.<p><b>the attire of his cupbearers</b><br>The cupbearers' attire further emphasizes the wealth and sophistication of Solomon's court. As trusted officials, cupbearers held a significant position, ensuring the king's safety and well-being. Their attire would reflect their important role and the trust placed in them. This can be compared to the role of believers as servants of Christ, who are called to be trustworthy and faithful in their service, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>.<p><b>and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD</b><br>The burnt offerings presented by Solomon at the temple demonstrate his devotion and obedience to God. These offerings were a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. Solomon's commitment to offering sacrifices aligns with the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>. This act of worship prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect atonement for sin, fulfilling the sacrificial system.<p><b>it took her breath away</b><br>The Queen of Sheba's reaction to Solomon's wisdom and the splendor of his court underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon renowned among the nations. Her amazement reflects the impact of God's blessings on Israel, drawing the attention of surrounding nations. This encounter foreshadows the coming of Christ, whose wisdom and glory surpass that of Solomon, as noted in <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>.

She witnessed tangible proof of God&#8217;s blessing on Israel&#8217;s king. Solomon&#8217;s daily provisions were staggering&#8212;&#8220;thirty cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal, ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, and a hundred sheep&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22-23</a>). Such abundance confirmed that the Lord&#8217;s promise of prosperity to David&#8217;s son was literally unfolding before her eyes (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). In Jesus&#8217; ministry we glimpse a similar display of divine provision when five thousand were fed from a boy&#8217;s lunch (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19-21</a>); both scenes point to a God who supplies &#8220;exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The seating of his servants</b><p>Order, honor, and rank marked the palace. Each official sat in an assigned place, reflecting the wisdom that &#8220;there is a time and a way for everything&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a>) and a place for everyone in Solomon&#8217;s administration. This structure mirrors Paul&#8217;s teaching that God is &#8220;not a God of disorder but of peace&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>), and it foreshadows the heavenly throne room where twenty-four elders sit in designated seats around God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>). The queen realized that such meticulous arrangement could only flow from divinely granted wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/10-8.htm">1 Kings 10:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The service and attire of his attendants</b><p>Every attendant performed his task with excellence, clad in garments that broadcast dignity. Their disciplined service fulfilled Moses&#8217; charge that Israel be a &#8220;kingdom of priests&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>) who serve in holiness. Centuries later, Peter calls believers to that same priestly service (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), and Paul urges us to &#8220;wear&#8221; good works like well-fitted clothes (<a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>).

Likewise, in Christ&#8217;s kingdom no task is insignificant; the least act of service done in His name is honored (<a href="/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a>). The queen&#8217;s breathless response echoed David&#8217;s earlier confession: &#8220;Better a day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD</b><p>Finally, the queen accompanied Solomon to the temple and watched him present burnt offerings&#8212;whole animals consumed by fire, symbolizing total devotion (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). In Solomon&#8217;s sacrifices she saw that Israel&#8217;s king, though fabulously wealthy, acknowledged his dependence on God.

Each detail left the Queen of Sheba breathless because it revealed a ruler who stewarded God&#8217;s gifts for God&#8217;s glory. The same Lord still provides, orders, clothes, protects, and receives the living sacrifices of those who walk in His wisdom today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And his ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord.</span>--Kings, "And his <span class= "ital">burnt offering which he offered</span> in the house of the Lord." The LXX., Syr., and Vulg. here agree with Kings; and the Arab. reads, "the altar on which he offered." In all other passages, the word used in our text (<span class= "ital">'aliy?h</span>) means not <span class= "ital">ascent,</span> but <span class= "ital">upper chamber;</span> it is likely, therefore, that in the present instance it is merely an error of transcription for the term occurring in Kings (<span class= "ital">'ol?h,</span> "burnt-offering").<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> meat of his table (see <a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>). Translating our thoughts rather violently into modern language, we might picture the queen inspecting the <span class="accented">kitchens</span> of the palace, and remember that the kitchens of an Oriental court did the work, not of an individual "table," but of those of a very large domestic and official retinue; much more these of Solomon now. Keil and Bertheau, however, with others, refer this expression to the set-out of one meal-table (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> that of a modern banquet, wedding breakfast, or the like), where both the abounding lading of the table and the ample variety of the courses, and the rich foreign or home fruits, in season or out of season, and the furnishing and decorating of the table, all come in to add their contribution of effect; and they quote not inaptly our ver. 20, elucidated by <a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>. This was a daily glory with Solomon's palace-establishment. The immediate connection and the contents of this verse, though difficult, favour this direction of explanation, as will be seen in the succeeding clauses. <span class="cmt_word">The sitting of his servants</span>. The word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) occurs forty-three times, and is rendered in the Authorized Version thirty-two of these times as "habitation" or "dwelling." Of the remaining eleven times, one or other of those words would be almost the synonym of the word used, and in every ease the rendering "dwelling," if kept to the general idea of a dwelling or resting-place more or less <span class="accented">temporary</span>, would not be inappropriate or inconsistent with the evident drift of the connection; only here and in the parallel is the inconvenient rendering "sitting" adopted by the Authorized Version. Hence we disagree with Professor Dr. Murphy's explanation, <span class="accented">the sitting, i.e.</span> "in council of his chief officers." What the nature of the <span class="accented">location</span> (to use a term least specific) of the servants pointed to here is, nevertheless, still not quite clear. It is evidently placed in some antithesis with the <span class="accented">standing</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the standing-place) here rendered 'inadequately or incorrectly, <span class="cmt_word">the attendance of his ministers</span>. <span class="accented">The attendance, i.e.</span> "the station (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>) (see the four other occurrences of this' word: <a href="/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>). <span class="accented">Of his ministers</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, participle of a piel verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>. This word, in an amazing majority of the hundred occurrences of it, expresses ministry of <span class="accented">sacred</span> service of some kind. It may, indeed, be said that the present passage, with only one or two others, are doubtful in this meaning or character of explanation. To our next clause, referring to <span class="cmt_word">their apparel</span>, we find in the parallel mention, as here, of the <span class="cmt_word">cupbearers</span>, though the matter of <span class="accented">their</span> apparel is not included as it is here. Part of the difficulty of the verse arises from the consideration that up to this point the contents of the successive clauses of it may compose possibly enough a sharp graphic description of the daily banquet scene. An apt reference to similar description of Arabian banquets is given in the 'Speaker's Commentary ' as to be found in vol. it. pp. 213-215 of 'Ancient Monarchies.' Our next clause, however, brings us back into difficulty by its reference to Solomon's <span class="cmt_word">ascent</span> by <span class="cmt_word">which he went up into the house of the Lord</span> (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a> with our Exposition, 'Pulpit Commentary'), apparently so unseasonably; nor are we much helped by reading, with the Septuagint, "the burnt offerings which he offered at the house of the Lord." The obscurity and lack of coherence are not formidable, indeed, and perhaps may be with moderate satisfaction set down again to the account of the occasionally careless selection of the compilers from the material of the older work. Possibly the allusion in our ver. 11 to the <span class="accented">terraces</span>, or stairs, or highways (see margin) to "the house of the Lord," <span class="accented">and to the king's palace</span>, may hold some clue to the <span class="accented">ascent</span> being adverted to here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;ma&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
