The priests were descendants of Aaron, and their lineage was meticulously recorded to ensure that only those with the proper heritage could serve in the temple. This practice underscores the emphasis on holiness and order in worship, as seen in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>, where God commands Moses to bring Aaron and his sons to serve as priests. The genealogical records also reflect the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His covenant people, as He preserves the line of priests to serve Him.<p><b>as well as to the Levites twenty years of age or older</b><br>The Levites, distinct from the priests, were responsible for various duties in the temple, including music, maintenance, and assisting the priests. The age requirement of twenty years or older for service aligns with the instructions given in <a href="/numbers/4.htm">Numbers 4</a>, where Levites were counted for service from the age of thirty, but later adjusted to twenty in <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24-27</a>. This change reflects the evolving needs of temple service and the practical considerations of managing a large and complex religious institution. The Levites' role is a reminder of the diverse gifts and callings within the body of believers, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-6</a>.<p><b>according to their responsibilities and divisions</b><br>The organization of the Levites into divisions and specific responsibilities illustrates the order and structure that characterized temple worship. This system ensured that the work of the temple was carried out efficiently and that each Levite knew their role, as detailed in <a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24-26</a>. The divisions also allowed for a rotation of service, preventing burnout and ensuring that the temple was always adequately staffed. This structured approach to worship and service is echoed in the New Testament, where the church is described as a body with many parts, each with its own function (<a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4-8</a>). The division of responsibilities among the Levites can also be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfills all roles perfectly as our High Priest, intercessor, and servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms, including the reorganization of the priestly and Levitical duties.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Descendants of Aaron, responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple rituals.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Levi, assigned to assist the priests and manage the temple services.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/genealogy.htm">Genealogy</a></b><br>The recorded lineage used to determine the rightful duties and roles within the temple service.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship where the temple was located and where these reforms were implemented.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/importance_of_order_and_structure.htm">Importance of Order and Structure</a></b><br>God values order in worship and service, as seen in the detailed genealogical records and division of duties.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_leadership_in_spiritual_reforms.htm">Role of Leadership in Spiritual Reforms</a></b><br>Hezekiah's leadership demonstrates the impact a godly leader can have in restoring proper worship and service to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_responsibility.htm">Generational Responsibility</a></b><br>The inclusion of those "twenty years of age or older" highlights the importance of involving younger generations in the service of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_assigned_roles.htm">Faithfulness in Assigned Roles</a></b><br>Each person had a specific role according to their family and division, emphasizing the need for faithfulness in the roles God assigns us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_31_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 31:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_31_17_s_role_in_ministry_today.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 31:17 emphasize the importance of organized ministry roles today?

Levites were likewise divided by task&#8212;musicians, gatekeepers, officials (2 Chron 8:14).<p>&#8226; Hezekiah revived that structure (2 Chron 31:2), directing offerings to each division at the right time and place (compare <a href="/luke/1-8.htm">Luke 1:8&#8211;9</a>, where Zechariah is on duty &#8220;in the division of Abijah&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Order in worship reflects God&#8217;s own nature (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). By matching provision to responsibility, Hezekiah ensured continuous praise, teaching, and sacrifice &#8220;day by day, morning and evening&#8221; (2 Chron 31:3).<p>Good stewardship is never random; it aligns resources with clearly defined callings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/31-17.htm">2 Chronicles 31:17</a> shows Hezekiah distributing the people&#8217;s offerings with precision: only duly registered priests received portions; every Levite from age twenty upward was included; and each group was supplied according to its appointed duty. The verse illustrates how spiritual renewal involves both heartfelt devotion and practical administration, proving that when God&#8217;s servants are supported in an orderly, biblical manner, the worship of the Lord flourishes without interruption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Both to the genealogy.</span>--The verse is a parenthesis relating to the registration of the priests and Levites, suggested by the occurrence of the word "register" in <a href="/2_chronicles/31-16.htm" title="Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even to every one that enters into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;">2Chronicles 31:16</a>. Translate, "And as to the register of the priests, it was according to their clans (Heb., <span class= "ital">father-houses</span>); and the Levites from twenty years old and upwards were in their offices in their divisions." For the latter statement, see <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm" title="These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.">1Chronicles 23:24</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - It is hard to feel certain as to the exact construction of this and the following verse.

He thus treats both vers. 16 and 17 as parenthetical. It seems quite as probable that the "to give" should be shown before ver. 17 as well as ver. 18. On the whole, this seems to suit best the entire passage. The significant <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, at the beginning of ver. 17, neutralizes then the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> of ver. 16, and connects vers. 15 and 17.
