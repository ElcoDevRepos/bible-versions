The "house of the LORD" refers to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites. The king's presence in the temple underscores the importance of royal leadership in spiritual matters. Historically, the temple was the focal point of Jewish religious life, and the king's visits would have been significant events. This practice reflects the king's role as both a political and spiritual leader, responsible for upholding the covenant with God.<p><b>the guards would go with him</b><br>The presence of guards highlights the importance of security and protection for the king, especially during religious activities. This detail underscores the political tensions and potential threats faced by the monarchy. The guards' role also signifies the reverence and solemnity of the king's visit to the temple, ensuring that the sanctity of the place was maintained. In a broader biblical context, the presence of guards can be seen as a reminder of the need for vigilance in spiritual matters, as echoed in passages like <a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>, where watchfulness is emphasized.<p><b>bearing the shields</b><br>The shields mentioned here are likely the gold shields that Rehoboam had made after the original ones were taken by Shishak, king of Egypt (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-9.htm">2 Chronicles 12:9-10</a>). These shields symbolize the glory and splendor of the kingdom, as well as the loss and subsequent attempt to restore honor. The act of bearing shields during the king's temple visits may also symbolize the protection and defense of the faith and the nation. In a typological sense, shields can represent faith itself, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>, where the "shield of faith" is part of the armor of God.<p><b>and later they would return them to the guardroom</b><br>Returning the shields to the guardroom indicates a routine and organized practice, reflecting the structured nature of temple service and royal protocol. The guardroom served as a secure place for storing valuable items, emphasizing the importance of stewardship and responsibility. This action can be seen as a metaphor for the cyclical nature of worship and duty, where sacred objects are used and then carefully preserved. The concept of returning and safeguarding can be connected to the biblical theme of faithfulness, as seen in parables like the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where stewardship is a key lesson.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_rehoboam.htm">King Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign is marked by a division of the kingdom and spiritual decline.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_the_lord.htm">House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/guards.htm">Guards</a></b><br>The royal guards responsible for the protection of the king and the temple, symbolizing vigilance and duty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shields.htm">Shields</a></b><br>These were likely bronze shields made to replace the gold ones taken by Shishak, king of Egypt, symbolizing a loss of glory and divine favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/guardroom.htm">Guardroom</a></b><br>The place where the shields were stored, representing a return to routine and order after the king's visit to the temple.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_vigilance.htm">Spiritual Vigilance</a></b><br>Just as the guards accompanied the king with shields, Christians are called to be vigilant in their spiritual walk, always prepared with the armor of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_shields.htm">Symbolism of Shields</a></b><br>The replacement of gold shields with bronze signifies a loss of divine favor due to disobedience.
