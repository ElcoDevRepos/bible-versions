Historically, the "people of the land" often played a significant role in political events, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a> when they supported Joash against Athaliah. Their involvement indicates a collective action or consensus among the populace, reflecting their dissatisfaction with the conspirators' actions.<p><b>killed all those who had conspired against King Amon</b><br>King Amon was assassinated by his own servants, as detailed in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-24.htm">2 Chronicles 33:24</a>. The killing of the conspirators by the people suggests a rejection of the coup and a desire to restore order and legitimacy. This act of retribution aligns with the principle of justice found in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where the shedding of blood requires accountability. It also reflects the cultural and legal norms of the time, where blood vengeance was a common practice.<p><b>and they made his son Josiah king in his place</b><br>Josiah, Amon's son, was made king by the people, indicating their support for the Davidic line and legitimate succession. Josiah's reign is significant in biblical history, as he became one of Judah's most righteous kings, initiating major religious reforms and restoring the worship of Yahweh (2 Kings 22-23). His ascension fulfills the promise of a Davidic ruler, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, and foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the eternal King from David's line. Josiah's reign also connects to prophecies such as those in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which speak of a renewed covenant and spiritual revival.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>Amon was the king of Judah, the son of Manasseh, and father of Josiah.

In Scripture this term often highlights a grassroots response, as in <a href="/2_kings/21-24.htm">2 Kings 21:24</a>, where the same event is recorded.<p>&#8211; Their unified action shows that moral conviction was still alive among common folk even after two generations of idolatrous kings (Manasseh and Amon).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s law placed responsibility for justice on the whole community (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-12.htm">Deuteronomy 19:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>). The people step into that role here, demonstrating that righteousness is not confined to kings and priests.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>killed all those who had conspired against King Amon</b><p>&#8211; Amon&#8217;s own servants had assassinated him (<a href="/2_kings/21-23.htm">2 Kings 21:23</a>).

God had promised a continual dynasty to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>); the people&#8217;s action keeps that covenantal line intact.<p>&#8211; <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> later affirms the legitimacy of punishing evil; the principle is already in motion here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they made his son Josiah king in his place</b><p>&#8211; Josiah, though only eight years old (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-1.htm">2 Chronicles 34:1</a>), is installed immediately, preventing a power vacuum.<p>&#8211; This choice honors primogeniture and covenant, contrasting with earlier periods when rival claimants seized the throne (<a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1-3</a>).<p>&#8211; God had foretold Josiah by name three hundred years earlier in <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>.

It may be that the facts thus briefly recorded represent a fierce conflict between the party of religious reform and that of religious reaction, in which the latter was for the time worsted and reduced to a state of suspended activity.<p>The chronicler has omitted the remarks usual at the end of a reign. See <a href="/context/2_kings/21-25.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?">2Kings 21:25-26</a> for a reference to sources, and Anion's burial place ("the garden of Uzza").<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people of the land</span>. The emphatic expression here used (as also in the parallel), with its repetition in same verse malting it more so, may either betray the unfortunate sympathy that the worse element of the nation felt with the bad king and his evil ways, or it may mean that the healthier element of the people insisted on the right respect being observed to the proper succession. The conduct of Josiah from very tender years, which could not have been entirely his own, but must be credited in part to those who taught and influenced him, throws the balance of probability, perhaps, into this latter and more charitable view. The parallel contains two closing verses (25, 26) additional to what we have, giving the authority as the "book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah," and stating that Amen also "was buried in his sepulchre, in the garden of Uzza." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/33-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
