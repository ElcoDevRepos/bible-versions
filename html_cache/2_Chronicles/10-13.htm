His harsh answer reflects a lack of wisdom and understanding, contrasting with the gentle and wise approach of his grandfather, King David. The harshness can be seen as a failure to heed the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger." Rehoboam's response led to the division of the kingdom, fulfilling the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). This moment marks a significant turning point in Israel's history, as the united monarchy established under David and Solomon is fractured.<p><b>King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders.</b><br>Rehoboam's rejection of the elders' counsel is a pivotal decision that demonstrates his immaturity and pride. The elders, who had served his father Solomon, likely offered advice based on years of experience and understanding of the people's needs. Their counsel to lighten the people's burdens was rooted in wisdom and compassion, aligning with the biblical principle of servant leadership exemplified by Jesus Christ, who said, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve" (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). Rehoboam's choice to ignore their advice in favor of the younger advisors' counsel reveals a preference for power and control over empathy and service, leading to disastrous consequences for the kingdom. This decision underscores the importance of seeking and valuing wise counsel, a theme echoed throughout the Proverbs, which Solomon himself authored.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.
