The priests and Levites were the religious leaders responsible for temple worship and maintenance. The Levites, descendants of Levi, were set apart for religious duties (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-10</a>).

It highlights the temple's significance as a national religious center.<p><b>to repair the house of your God</b><br>The temple, referred to as "the house of your God," was central to Jewish worship and identity. Its repair was crucial for the proper conduct of religious rituals and sacrifices. This phrase underscores the temple's role as a symbol of God's presence among His people and the need for its upkeep to maintain a right relationship with God.<p><b>Do it quickly.&#8221;</b><br>The urgency in Joash's command reflects the temple's deteriorating condition and the immediate need for restoration. This urgency can be seen as a call to prioritize spiritual matters and the worship of God, emphasizing the importance of timely obedience to God's commands.<p><b>The Levites, however, did not make haste.</b><br>This phrase indicates a delay or reluctance on the part of the Levites to carry out the king's orders. It may suggest issues of complacency or miscommunication among the religious leaders.

Solomon had declared, &#8220;My father David had it in his heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD&#8221; (2 Chron 6:7), and Joash steps into that same purpose. The priority also answers the prophetic cry of <a href="/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;Is it a time for you yourselves to live in paneled houses while this house lies in ruins?&#8221; Spiritual vitality is tied to honoring God&#8217;s dwelling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Do it quickly.&#8221;</b><p>Urgency marks biblical obedience. &#8220;The king&#8217;s business required haste&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/21-8.htm">1 Samuel 21:8</a>). Delayed obedience easily becomes disobedience, as <a href="/2_kings/12-6.htm">2 Kings 12:6</a> shows when the priests had failed to repair the temple by Joash&#8217;s twenty-third year. The New Testament echoes this tempo: &#8220;Do not lag in diligence&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>) and &#8220;Whatever you do, do it heartily, as for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). Swift action honors God and shields the heart from distraction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Levites, however, did not make haste.</b><p>Despite clear instruction, the Levites hesitated. Their slow response forced Joash to summon Jehoiada and ask, &#8220;Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah&#8230;?&#8221; (2 Chron 24:6). Reasons aren&#8217;t detailed, but Scripture warns that negligence dissipates blessing: &#8220;Whoever is slack in his work is brother to him who destroys&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/18-9.htm">Proverbs 18:9</a>). Later, the collection succeeds only after a chest is set at the gate (2 Chron 24:8&#8211;10), underscoring that God&#8217;s work advances when leaders and people alike obey promptly (<a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a> highlights God&#8217;s pattern for revival: leadership mobilized, the whole covenant community participating, priority placed on God&#8217;s house, obedience carried out with urgency&#8212;and the danger when zeal cools. Joash&#8217;s command shows that the LORD supplies and expects diligent stewardship, while the Levites&#8217; delay warns that half-hearted service hampers kingdom work. The verse calls every generation to wholehearted, timely obedience so the dwelling place of God&#8212;now His church (<a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a>)&#8212;remains strong and glorious.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money.</span>--This is the chronicler's interpretation of "Let the priests take it to themselves, each from his own acquaintance" (Kings). The priests and Levites of the different districts were to collect the moneys due to the sanctuary, each in his own neighbourhood.<p><span class= "bld">And see that ye hasten the matter.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and, for your part, hasten ye in regard to the matter</span> (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/18-8.htm" title="And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.">2Chronicles 18:8</a>); <span class= "ital">and the Levites hastened not.</span> This agrees with the statement in <a href="/2_kings/12-6.htm" title="But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.">2Kings 12:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-9.htm" title="But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.">2Kings 12:9</a> : "And it was so, <span class= "ital">that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash</span> the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house." The remissness of the priestly order is evidently inferable from these words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To repair</span>. The idea of this verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>) is that of <span class="accented">making strong. <span class="cmt_word"></span>From year to year</span>. The compound adverbial expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, here used for "from," era-braces the idea of" unfailingly from year to year." The command given here to the priests and Levites is expressed very differently, though in no degree contadictorily, in the parallel (see its vers. 4, 5). The addition is there found, "every man of his acquaintance;" this expression may glance at the very supposable circumstance that the priest and Levite collecting deputations would naturally go respectively to the towns and cities where they had been located beforetime. A slight ambiguity is perhaps occasioned by the impression that the fourth verse (in the parallel) produces - that the priests and Levites should wait to <span class="accented">receive, e.g.</span>, in Jerusalem. This, however, is sot what is <span class="accented">said</span>, and need not, therefore, be made into a difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the Levites hastened not.</span> We are not told <span class="accented">why</span> this delay was, nor does the subsequent narrative seem to elucidate it, further than this - that the delay somehow seemed to rest with Jehoiada, as the king appealed to him for explanation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So he gathered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1509;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;b&#333;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
