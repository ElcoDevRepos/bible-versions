The "kingdom of the LORD" refers to the divinely sanctioned rule over Israel, which was promised to David and his descendants (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The speaker, Abijah, is addressing Jeroboam and the northern tribes, emphasizing their rebellion against God's ordained monarchy. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human resistance to divine authority, seen throughout Scripture, such as in the rebellion of Korah (Numbers 16) and the rejection of Jesus as King (<a href="/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a>).<p><b>which is in the hands of David&#8217;s descendants</b><br>The Davidic covenant established that David's lineage would have a perpetual throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). This covenant is a key element in the biblical narrative, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). The phrase underscores the legitimacy of Judah's rule, contrasting it with the illegitimate rule of Jeroboam, who led the northern tribes into idolatry and away from the Davidic line.<p><b>You are indeed a vast army</b><br>This acknowledges the military strength of Jeroboam's forces, which consisted of ten tribes compared to Judah's two. Historically, the northern kingdom was often more populous and powerful, yet this phrase serves as a reminder that numerical strength does not equate to divine favor. This theme is echoed in other biblical accounts, such as Gideon's victory with a small army (Judges 7) and David's triumph over Goliath (1 Samuel 17), where God's power is shown to be greater than human might.<p><b>and you have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods</b><br>Jeroboam's creation of golden calves (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>) was a significant act of idolatry, intended to prevent the northern tribes from worshiping in Jerusalem. This act mirrored the sin of the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 32), where they made a golden calf while Moses was on Mount Sinai. The calves symbolized a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and represented a turning away from the worship of Yahweh. This idolatry set a precedent for the northern kingdom's spiritual decline, leading to its eventual downfall and exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is speaking in this verse.
