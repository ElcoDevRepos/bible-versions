The division of the united monarchy into the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah) followed Solomon's reign. Abijah's pursuit of Jeroboam signifies a military campaign to reclaim territory and assert Judah's dominance. This pursuit reflects the ongoing struggle for power and legitimacy between the two kingdoms, rooted in the broader narrative of Israel's history.<p><b>and captured some cities from him:</b><br>The capture of cities indicates a significant military victory for Abijah. In the ancient Near East, capturing cities was a common way to expand territory and influence. This victory would have bolstered Abijah's position and demonstrated God's favor, as victories were often seen as divine endorsement. The capture of these cities also weakened Jeroboam's control over the northern kingdom.<p><b>Bethel,</b><br>Bethel holds historical and religious significance in Israel's history. It was a major religious center, associated with patriarchal narratives such as Jacob's dream (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-19</a>). Under Jeroboam, Bethel became a center for idolatrous worship, with one of the golden calves placed there (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). Abijah's capture of Bethel could symbolize a reclaiming of spiritual purity and a rejection of idolatry.<p><b>Jeshanah,</b><br>Jeshanah is less prominent in biblical records, but its mention here indicates its strategic importance. The capture of Jeshanah would have been part of securing the northern border of Judah. This city, like others, would have been fortified, and its capture would have disrupted Jeroboam's defenses, further consolidating Abijah's military success.<p><b>and Ephron,</b><br>Ephron, also known as Ephraim in some texts, was another strategic location. Its capture would have provided a tactical advantage, controlling routes and resources. The mention of Ephron highlights the thoroughness of Abijah's campaign, ensuring that key locations were secured to prevent future incursions by Jeroboam.<p><b>along with their villages.</b><br>Capturing the villages surrounding these cities ensured control over the region's agricultural and economic resources. Villages were essential for sustaining the cities, providing food, labor, and trade. By capturing both the cities and their villages, Abijah not only gained military control but also economic stability, which would have been crucial for maintaining his kingdom's strength and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Rehoboam, and grandson of Solomon.

Scripture says, &#8220;The men of Judah prevailed because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-18.htm">2 Chronicles 13:18</a>). Earlier in the chapter Abijah had stood on Mount Zemaraim and boldly declared the covenant promises (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-12</a>). Now his actions match his words. The pursuit fulfills God&#8217;s prior warning to Jeroboam that his rebellion would crumble (<a href="/1_kings/14-9.htm">1 Kings 14:9-10</a>). Just as Joshua was told to advance in faith (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>), Abijah moves forward, trusting the same faithful God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and captured some cities from him</b><p>The victory is not abstract&#8212;it is geographic and measurable. Judah gains ground that had been under idolatrous control. This echoes earlier moments when the LORD handed territory to His people (De 20:4; <a href="/joshua/10-42.htm">Joshua 10:42</a>). The text stresses that it was &#8220;from him&#8221; (Jeroboam), highlighting divine judgment on unfaithfulness (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>).<p>Key observations:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s deliverance is tangible; righteousness brings real-world blessing (<a href="/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin costs nations dearly; Jeroboam&#8217;s false worship leads to territorial loss (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-15.htm">2 Chronicles 13:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Captured cities become testimonies of God&#8217;s supremacy, much as Ai and Jericho once did (<a href="/joshua/8-28.htm">Joshua 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bethel</b><p>Bethel means &#8220;house of God,&#8221; yet Jeroboam turned it into a shrine for a golden calf (<a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29</a>). Reclaiming Bethel reverses that desecration. It also reminds readers of Jacob&#8217;s encounter with God there (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18-19</a>).<p>Consider:<p>&#8226; God reclaims what bears His name from idolatry.<p>&#8226; Bethel&#8217;s recapture invites renewed worship in truth, contrasting Jeroboam&#8217;s counterfeit religion (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The event foreshadows future purgings, such as Josiah&#8217;s reforms (<a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeshanah</b><p>Though lesser-known, Jeshanah sits strategically on the border between kingdoms. Taking it secures Judah&#8217;s northern approach. The gain illustrates <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>: &#8220;Victory rests with the LORD.&#8221; Just as Asa would later fortify frontier towns (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-6.htm">2 Chronicles 14:6-7</a>), Abijah&#8217;s capture of Jeshanah bolsters national defense and affirms God&#8217;s promise of security for those who walk with Him (<a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ephron</b><p>Located in the hill country, Ephron (also rendered Ephrain) oversees key routes toward the Jordan. By seizing this elevated position, Abijah controls movement and trade, fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>, &#8220;The LORD will make you the head and not the tail.&#8221; The victory foils any quick counter-attack from Israel and extends Judah&#8217;s influence, much like David&#8217;s capture of strongholds earlier (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with their villages</b><p>God&#8217;s blessing reaches beyond city walls to &#8220;their villages.&#8221; The phrase shows comprehensive triumph, paralleling <a href="/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12</a> where surrounding fields mattered as much as fortified centers. Practical outcomes include:<p>&#8226; Economic growth&#8212;fields, flocks, and vineyards now benefit Judah (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Secure homes&#8212;families in outlying hamlets experience peace (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Witness to neighbors&#8212;nearby nations observe that &#8220;the LORD has done great things for them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/126-2.htm">Psalm 126:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abijah&#8217;s pursuit, enabled by unwavering trust in the LORD, overturns Jeroboam&#8217;s rebellion and restores key territories&#8212;Bethel, Jeshanah, Ephron, and every adjoining village. Each captured site testifies that God defends His covenant people, judges idolatry, and tangibly blesses obedience.
