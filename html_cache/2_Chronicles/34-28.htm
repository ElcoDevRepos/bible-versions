It reflects the Hebrew understanding of Sheol, where the dead reside. The phrase suggests a continuation of the covenantal relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-15.htm">Genesis 15:15</a>, where God promises Abraham a peaceful death. It underscores the idea of divine favor and rest after a life of faithfulness.<p><b>and you will be gathered to your grave in peace</b><br>This assurance of dying in peace contrasts with the turmoil and judgment prophesied for Judah. It highlights God's mercy towards King Josiah, who led significant religious reforms (2 Kings 22-23). The peace mentioned here is not just the absence of conflict but a state of divine favor, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/57.htm">Isaiah 57:1-2</a>, where the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.<p><b>Your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place and on its people</b><br>This phrase refers to the impending judgment on Judah due to its persistent idolatry and disobedience. Josiah's reforms delayed but did not prevent the Babylonian exile. The calamity is detailed in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-21</a>, where the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple is described. This promise to Josiah is reminiscent of God's mercy shown to Noah, who was spared from the flood (Genesis 6-9).<p><b>So they brought her answer back to the king</b><br>The "her" refers to Huldah the prophetess, who delivered God's message to Josiah's messengers. This highlights the role of women in biblical prophecy, as seen with Deborah (Judges 4-5). Huldah's prophecy confirmed the authenticity of the Book of the Law found in the temple, emphasizing the importance of God's word in guiding the king's reforms.
