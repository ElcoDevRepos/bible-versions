These chains symbolize strength and unity, reflecting the interconnectedness of God's covenant with Israel. The use of chains in ancient architecture often signified security and stability, which is fitting for the temple as a place of divine presence. The pillars themselves, standing at the entrance, represent the strength and establishment of God's promises. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as living stones being built into a spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><b>He made a hundred pomegranates and fastened them into the chainwork.</b><br>Pomegranates are frequently used in biblical symbolism, representing fruitfulness, abundance, and the law. The number one hundred signifies completeness and fullness, suggesting the abundant blessings and the completeness of God's law. Pomegranates were also embroidered on the hem of the high priest's robe (<a href="/exodus/28-33.htm">Exodus 28:33-34</a>), linking the temple's design to the priestly garments and the holiness required in worship. The use of pomegranates in the temple's decoration underscores the theme of life and fertility, pointing to the life-giving presence of God. In a typological sense, the abundance of pomegranates can be seen as a foreshadowing of the spiritual fruitfulness found in Christ, who fulfills the law and brings life to His people (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling his father David's vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pillars.htm">Pillars</a></b><br>Two significant structures named Jachin and Boaz, located at the entrance of the temple, representing stability and strength.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/chains.htm">Chains</a></b><br>Decorative elements used in the temple, symbolizing connection and unity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pomegranates.htm">Pomegranates</a></b><br>Fruit used as a decorative motif, symbolizing abundance, fertility, and the law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_temple.htm">Symbolism of the Temple</a></b><br>The temple represents God's dwelling among His people.
