The "evil" refers to idolatry and practices contrary to the covenant established with Israel. This echoes the recurring theme in the books of Kings and Chronicles where the deeds of the kings are assessed based on their faithfulness to God. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores the omniscience of God, who sees and judges all actions.<p><b>as the house of Ahab had done</b><br>The house of Ahab is synonymous with idolatry and apostasy in Israel's history. Ahab, influenced by his wife Jezebel, promoted the worship of Baal, leading Israel into sin. This comparison suggests that the king followed similar practices, aligning himself with the northern kingdom's notorious legacy. The influence of Ahab's house extended beyond Israel, affecting Judah as well, illustrating the pervasive impact of ungodly leadership.<p><b>for to his destruction they were his counselors</b><br>This highlights the role of advisors in shaping a king's policies and actions. The counselors from Ahab's house likely encouraged idolatry and political alliances contrary to God's commands. The phrase "to his destruction" indicates the inevitable downfall that results from rejecting God's ways. It serves as a warning about the consequences of surrounding oneself with ungodly influences and the importance of seeking wise, godly counsel.<p><b>after the death of his father</b><br>The death of the king's father, Jehoram, marks a transition of power and influence. It suggests a shift in the king's advisors and possibly a loosening of any remaining restraints on idolatrous practices. This period of vulnerability and change often led to poor decisions, as seen in other biblical accounts where new kings were swayed by negative influences. The absence of a godly father figure may have contributed to the king's susceptibility to the corrupt counsel of Ahab's house.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaziah.htm">Ahaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who followed the evil practices of the house of Ahab.
