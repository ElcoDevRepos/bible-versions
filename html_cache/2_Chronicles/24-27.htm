Joash, also known as Jehoash, was a king who initially followed the ways of the Lord under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest. The mention of his sons indicates the continuation of his lineage, which is significant in the context of the Davidic line. The sons of Joash would have been expected to carry on the legacy of their father, though the biblical narrative often highlights the challenges and failures of subsequent generations. This phrase underscores the importance of family and lineage in the biblical narrative, particularly in the context of the covenant promises made to David.<p><b>and the many pronouncements about him</b><br>This refers to the various decrees, judgments, and events associated with King Joash's reign. Joash's reign was marked by both faithfulness and failure. Initially, he was zealous for the Lord, particularly in the restoration of the temple, but later he turned away from God, leading to his downfall. The "pronouncements" could include both the commendations for his early reforms and the condemnations for his later apostasy. This duality serves as a reminder of the importance of steadfastness in faith and the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>and of the restoration of the house of God</b><br>This phrase highlights one of Joash's significant achievements: the repair and restoration of the temple in Jerusalem. The temple, being the center of worship and the symbol of God's presence among His people, had fallen into disrepair. Joash's efforts to restore it reflect his initial commitment to honoring God and maintaining the proper worship practices. This restoration can be seen as a type of Christ, who Himself is the ultimate restorer of the temple, not made with hands, and who purifies and sanctifies His people.<p><b>are indeed written in the Treatise of the Book of the Kings</b><br>This indicates that the detailed records of Joash's reign, including his sons, pronouncements, and temple restoration, were documented in another historical source, the "Book of the Kings." This book is not part of the canonical Bible but is referenced as a source of historical information. It suggests that the biblical authors had access to other historical records, which they used to compile the narratives found in the Scriptures. This phrase underscores the historical reliability and the careful documentation of events in the biblical text.<p><b>And his son Amaziah reigned in his place</b><br>This phrase marks the transition of power from Joash to his son Amaziah. Amaziah's reign is a continuation of the Davidic line, which is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises to David. Amaziah, like his father, had a reign marked by both faithfulness and failure. His ascension to the throne signifies the ongoing narrative of the kings of Judah, each of whom played a role in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan. This transition also serves as a reminder of the temporal nature of earthly kingdoms and the enduring nature of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the Lord under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest but later turned away from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>Son of Joash, who succeeded him as king of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_god.htm">The House of God</a></b><br>Refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, which Joash initially worked to restore.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_treatise_of_the_book_of_the_kings.htm">The Treatise of the Book of the Kings</a></b><br>A historical record mentioned in the Bible, which contains more detailed accounts of the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oracles.htm">Oracles</a></b><br>Prophetic messages or divine communications concerning Joash, which are noted but not detailed in this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_counsel.htm">The Importance of Godly Counsel</a></b><br>Joash's early success was tied to the influence of Jehoiada.

In <a href="/2_chronicles/24-19.htm" title="Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.">2Chronicles 24:19</a> it is expressly said that prophets were sent to warn the princes of Judah. If this be the meaning here, the word <span class= "ital">massa'</span> is used collectively. Another possible rendering is, "and the greatness of the tribute laid upon him" by Hazael. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/17-11.htm" title="Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.">2Chronicles 17:11</a> for this sense of <span class= "ital">massa'</span>) The Heb. margin suggests, and as to his sons, may the burden concerning him multiply;" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> may the dying words of Zechariah be fulfilled in them even more disastrously! This is wholly improbable.<p><span class= "bld">In the story of the book of the kings.</span>--See margin, and Introduction. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His sons</span>.

The word rendered "story" or "commentary" in our text is employed only once beside (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>). Its verbal root, however, is found about a hundred and sixty-two times, invariably in the sense of inquiring, and almost invariably rendered in the Authorized Version by the word "inquire," or "seek;" so that perhaps the word "study" or "pursuit" might, idioms being allowed for, be the nearer rendering. It is rabbinic literature mostly that has determined the preference for the word "commentary." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/24-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The accounts of the sons [of Joash],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1438;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
