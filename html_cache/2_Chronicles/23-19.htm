The stationing of gatekeepers is a significant act of restoring order and holiness to the temple, which had been neglected under previous rulers. Gatekeepers were Levites, tasked with maintaining the sanctity of the temple by controlling access. This reflects the importance of purity and reverence in worship, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22-27</a>, where gatekeepers are described as having a critical role in temple service. The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<p><b>so that no one who was in any way unclean could enter</b><br>The concept of cleanliness and uncleanliness is deeply rooted in the Levitical laws, as outlined in Leviticus chapters 11-15. These laws were given to the Israelites to distinguish between what was holy and common, clean and unclean. The gatekeepers' role in preventing the unclean from entering the temple underscores the necessity of approaching God with purity, both physically and spiritually. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God calls His people to be set apart (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). The exclusion of the unclean also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of spiritual purity, where believers are called to be holy through the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>). The emphasis on purity in worship is a reminder of the need for repentance and sanctification in the life of a believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>A key figure in the restoration of true worship in Judah, Jehoiada orchestrated the overthrow of Queen Athaliah and the enthronement of Joash as king.
