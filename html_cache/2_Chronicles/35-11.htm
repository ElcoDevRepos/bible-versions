The statement is straightforward and historical&#8212;real animals, real priests, real worshipers. Three truths surface:<p>&#8226; Obedience to God&#8217;s command. Passover was instituted in <a href="/exodus/12-21.htm">Exodus 12:21&#8211;27</a> as a perpetual ordinance; Josiah&#8217;s generation was taking that command literally, just as <a href="/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-2</a> required.<p>&#8226; Remembrance of redemption. Each lamb recalled the night the Lord &#8220;passed over&#8221; Israel&#8217;s homes in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>), sparing them through the blood of a substitute.<p>&#8226; Anticipation of the ultimate Lamb. By following the original pattern so precisely, the worshipers unknowingly pointed forward to the &#8220;Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), and to the truth that &#8220;Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Priests splattered the blood handed to them</b><p>&#8220;While the priests splattered the blood handed to them&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-11.htm">2 Chronicles 35:11</a>) highlights the priests&#8217; unique role.<p>&#8226; Blood and atonement. <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a> explains that &#8220;the life of the flesh is in the blood &#8230; it is the blood that makes atonement.&#8221; The priests, acting as mediators, applied the blood to the altar (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/29-22.htm">2 Chronicles 29:22</a>), symbolizing substitutionary atonement.<p>&#8226; Proper order. Only Aaron&#8217;s descendants could handle the sacrificial blood (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>). Josiah&#8217;s revival honored that design, restoring reverence to worship.<p>&#8226; Foreshadowing the cross. <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> reminds us, &#8220;without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.&#8221; The priests&#8217; sprinkling action prefigured the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, whose blood &#8220;cleanses us from all sin&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Levites skinned the animals</b><p>&#8220;And the Levites skinned the animals&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-11.htm">2 Chronicles 35:11</a>) shows the supportive ministry of the wider Levitical tribe.<p>&#8226; Shared service.

Their skinning ensured the meat could be roasted quickly for the communal meal (<a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; God-given assignment. <a href="/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a> states that Levites were given &#8220;to do the work of the tent of meeting&#8221; so that Israel would not bear the guilt of approaching the sanctuary incorrectly.<p>&#8226; Lesson in teamwork.
