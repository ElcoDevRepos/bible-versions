This phrase indicates a recurring pattern of hostility. The Edomites' attacks were often opportunistic, taking advantage of Judah's weakened state. Historically, Edom was located to the southeast of Judah, in a region known for its rugged terrain. The repeated incursions by Edomites reflect the ongoing enmity between the two nations, which began with the struggle between Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p><b>and attacked Judah</b><br>Judah, the southern kingdom, was often vulnerable to attacks due to its strategic location. During the reign of King Ahaz, Judah was particularly weak, both politically and spiritually, as Ahaz had led the nation into idolatry and away from God. This attack by the Edomites is part of a series of military defeats that Judah suffered during Ahaz's reign, highlighting the consequences of turning away from God. The attack also fulfills the warnings given by prophets that disobedience would lead to foreign invasions (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>).<p><b>and carried away captives.</b><br>Taking captives was a common practice in ancient warfare, serving both as a means of weakening the enemy and as a source of labor or ransom. The carrying away of captives by the Edomites would have been a devastating blow to Judah, further depleting its population and resources. This act of captivity echoes the broader biblical theme of exile and redemption, seen most prominently in the Babylonian exile. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and freedom found in Jesus Christ, who came to set the captives free (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>Descendants of Esau, the brother of Jacob, who often had hostile relations with Israel and Judah.
