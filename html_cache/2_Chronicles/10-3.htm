His return from Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon, marks a pivotal moment in the division of the united monarchy. This action of sending for Jeroboam indicates the people's desire for change and their recognition of Jeroboam as a leader. Historically, Jeroboam's return is a fulfillment of the prophecy given by the prophet Ahijah, who had foretold that Jeroboam would rule over ten tribes of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>).<p><b>and he and all Israel came to Rehoboam</b><br>Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, was the rightful heir to the throne of Israel. The phrase "all Israel" suggests a united front from the tribes, indicating widespread discontent with Solomon's policies, particularly his heavy taxation and forced labor. This meeting at Shechem, a city with historical significance as a place of covenant renewal (Joshua 24), underscores the gravity of the situation. The gathering of "all Israel" also reflects the tribal structure of the nation, where decisions were often made collectively.<p><b>and said</b><br>The act of speaking to Rehoboam signifies a formal request or negotiation. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, such dialogues were crucial in determining the relationship between a ruler and his subjects. The people's approach to Rehoboam was not merely a complaint but a critical moment of potential reconciliation or division. This dialogue echoes the biblical theme of covenant and the responsibilities of a king to his people, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>, where the king is instructed to rule with justice and humility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Judah.
