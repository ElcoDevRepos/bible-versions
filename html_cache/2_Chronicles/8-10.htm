Solomon's reign is noted for its organization and prosperity, reflecting the wisdom God granted him. The chief officers were likely responsible for overseeing various aspects of the kingdom's operations, ensuring that Solomon's extensive building projects and other royal activities were efficiently managed. This mirrors the administrative roles seen in other ancient Near Eastern kingdoms, where a king's success often depended on the competence of his officials. The mention of "chief officers" underscores the importance of leadership and delegation in governance, a principle echoed in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>, where Moses appoints capable men to help judge the people.<p><b>250 supervisors:</b><br>The specific number of supervisors indicates a well-structured hierarchy within Solomon's administration. The number 250 may symbolize completeness and order, reflecting the organized nature of Solomon's reign. These supervisors likely had various responsibilities, including overseeing labor forces, managing resources, and ensuring the completion of Solomon's ambitious projects, such as the construction of the Temple and his palace. This level of organization is consistent with the descriptions of Solomon's wisdom and the prosperity of his kingdom found in <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>. The role of these supervisors can also be seen as a type of Christ, who delegates authority to His disciples and the Church to carry out His mission on earth, as seen in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

By saying &#8220;they were also,&#8221; the narrator ties these overseers into the larger story of temple and palace construction already detailed in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17-18</a> and <a href="/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15-16</a>. The verse reminds us that spiritual endeavors often depend on practical administration&#8212;God&#8217;s work calls for organized leadership.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the chief officers</b><p>The phrase highlights an upper tier of management. These are not ordinary foremen; they are &#8220;chief&#8221; (compare <a href="/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a>). Their tasks included:<p>&#8226; coordinating thousands of laborers (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-2.htm">2 Chronicles 2:2</a>)<p>&#8226; ensuring materials arrived on schedule (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>)<p>&#8226; maintaining order and justice among the workforce (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-23.htm">2 Chronicles 6:23</a>)<p>Their service reflects the principle that leadership is stewardship. Like the officials who served Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10-11</a>), they were accountable first to the king, yet ultimately to the Lord who &#8220;gave Solomon wisdom&#8221; to appoint them (<a href="/2_chronicles/1-12.htm">2 Chronicles 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for King Solomon</b><p>Their authority flowed from the throne. Solomon acted under the covenant promise God spoke to David (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-14.htm">2 Chronicles 6:14-17</a>), so these officers indirectly served God&#8217;s purposes. Similar wording in <a href="/1_kings/4-1.htm">1 Kings 4:1-6</a> shows how officials &#8220;for Solomon&#8221; managed civil affairs; here they focus on the building program. When leaders work &#8220;for&#8221; the one God has placed over them, they picture the believer&#8217;s calling to do everything &#8220;unto the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>250 supervisors</b><p>Chronicles records 250, while <a href="/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a> lists 550. The numbers harmonize when we note that Kings includes all overseers (both Israelite and foreign), whereas Chronicles counts only the Israelite &#8220;chief officers.&#8221; Scripture supplies exact figures to underline historical reliability (see <a href="/2_chronicles/3-8.htm">2 Chronicles 3:8</a>; 4:13). God values details; He &#8220;counts the stars&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>), and here He counts supervisors. The specific number also signals that the project was vast yet orderly&#8212;every fifty groups of workers had a seasoned leader (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/8-10.htm">2 Chronicles 8:10</a> shows the practical side of Solomon&#8217;s reign: wise delegation. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s great works require capable, accountable leadership; that authority ultimately serves the Lord&#8217;s covenant purposes; and that Scripture&#8217;s precise details affirm its trustworthiness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[They]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1448;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
