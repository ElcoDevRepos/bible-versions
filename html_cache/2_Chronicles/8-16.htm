Solomon's work on the temple is a fulfillment of the promise made to David, his father, that his son would build a house for the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of obedience and diligence in fulfilling God's commands. Solomon's efforts reflect the wisdom and resources God granted him, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>, where Solomon's wisdom and understanding are described as vast and unparalleled.<p><b>from the day the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD</b><br>The laying of the foundation is a significant event, marking the beginning of the temple's construction. This occurred in the fourth year of Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>). The foundation symbolizes the establishment of a permanent place for God's presence among His people, fulfilling the covenantal promise of a dwelling place for God in Israel. The foundation also represents the importance of a strong spiritual foundation in the life of believers, as echoed in the New Testament by Jesus' parable of the wise and foolish builders (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><b>until it was finished</b><br>The completion of the temple signifies the fulfillment of God's promise and the culmination of Solomon's efforts. It took seven years to build the temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>), reflecting the perfection and completeness often associated with the number seven in biblical literature. The finished temple becomes a central place of worship and sacrifice, where God's presence dwells among His people. This completion also prefigures the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus Christ, who declared, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), signifying the completion of His redemptive work.<p><b>So the house of the LORD was completed</b><br>The completion of the temple marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, establishing a central place for worship and the sacrificial system. The temple serves as a type of Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), where God's presence dwells fully. The physical temple foreshadows the spiritual temple, the body of Christ, and the church, which is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). The completion of the temple also points to the eschatological hope of the New Jerusalem, where God's presence will dwell with His people eternally (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites, which Solomon built as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foundation_of_the_temple.htm">The Foundation of the Temple</a></b><br>The beginning of the construction of the Temple, which was a significant event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/completion_of_the_temple.htm">Completion of the Temple</a></b><br>Marks the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for the Lord, signifying a period of peace and prosperity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, chosen by God as the location for His Temple, and a central place of worship and governance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_god's_work.htm">Faithfulness in God's Work</a></b><br>Solomon's dedication to completing the Temple serves as a model of faithfulness in fulfilling God's assignments.
