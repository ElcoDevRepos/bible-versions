This phrase indicates his adherence to the covenantal laws and his commitment to worshiping Yahweh. The phrase "in the eyes of the LORD" emphasizes divine approval, suggesting that Jotham's actions were aligned with God's standards, a recurring theme in the evaluation of kings in the books of Kings and Chronicles.<p><b>just as his father Uzziah had done</b><br>Uzziah, also known as Azariah, was a king who initially did what was right in God's eyes but later fell into pride, leading to his downfall (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>). Jotham is compared to Uzziah in his early years, highlighting the positive aspects of Uzziah's reign, such as military success and infrastructural development. This comparison serves as a reminder of the importance of humility and obedience to God throughout one's life.<p><b>In addition, he did not enter the temple of the LORD</b><br>This phrase refers to Uzziah's sin of unlawfully entering the temple to burn incense, an act reserved for priests (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-20</a>). Jotham's decision not to repeat his father's mistake demonstrates his respect for the Levitical priesthood and the proper worship practices. It underscores the importance of adhering to God's established order and the consequences of overstepping divine boundaries.<p><b>But the people still behaved corruptly</b><br>Despite Jotham's personal righteousness, the people of Judah continued in their sinful ways. This highlights the persistent issue of collective disobedience among the Israelites, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament. It reflects the challenge of leading a nation to spiritual renewal and the limitations of even a righteous king's influence. This situation foreshadows the need for a perfect and eternal king, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who would bring true and lasting transformation to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Uzziah, known for doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD.

Scripture repeatedly measures a king&#8217;s life by whether he &#8220;did what was right in the eyes of the LORD&#8221; (compare <a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2</a>). Here the chronicler plainly affirms Jotham&#8217;s personal obedience.<p>&#8226; Right means aligned with God&#8217;s revealed standards, not cultural opinion (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Eyes of the LORD reminds us that God Himself is the ultimate evaluator (<a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; This verdict highlights moral integrity, public justice, and covenant loyalty (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>By beginning with this approval, the text assures us that Jotham&#8217;s righteousness is real, not merely political spin (<a href="/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Just as his father Uzziah had done</b><p>The verse links Jotham with Uzziah&#8217;s early faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-4.htm">2 Chronicles 26:4-5</a>), before Uzziah&#8217;s pride led to downfall.<p>&#8226; Family heritage matters (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).

Jotham learns from history.<p>&#8226; Restraint is as much a mark of wisdom as action (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Respect for God&#8217;s boundaries preserves worship&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>).<p>&#8226; By honoring priestly roles, Jotham upholds the divinely ordered structure (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18-19</a>).<p>His choice shows that genuine righteousness includes humility before sacred things.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the people still behaved corruptly</b><p>Personal integrity does not automatically transform a nation.
