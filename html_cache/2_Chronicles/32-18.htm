This tactic was intended to bypass the leaders and speak directly to the common people, sowing fear and doubt. The use of Hebrew, the native language of the Judeans, highlights the Assyrians' intent to make their threats personal and relatable. This approach is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where language is used to influence and manipulate, such as the serpent speaking to Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall</b><br>The people on the wall were likely soldiers and watchmen tasked with defending the city. The walls of Jerusalem were not only physical barriers but also symbolic of God's protection over His people. The Assyrians' direct address to those on the wall signifies an attempt to undermine the city's defenses both physically and spiritually. This scene echoes the siege tactics used in other biblical accounts, such as the siege of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>, where the walls played a crucial role in the city's defense.<p><b>to frighten and terrify them</b><br>The Assyrians aimed to instill fear and terror, a common tactic in ancient warfare designed to weaken the resolve of the defenders. Fear is a powerful weapon that can lead to demoralization and surrender without a fight. This psychological warfare is contrasted with the biblical exhortation to trust in God and not fear, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God reassures His people of His presence and strength.<p><b>in order to capture the city</b><br>The ultimate goal of the Assyrians was the capture of Jerusalem, a significant city both politically and spiritually. Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, making it a prime target for conquest. The desire to capture Jerusalem can be seen as part of a larger spiritual battle, as the city represents God's covenant with His people. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative of the struggle between God's kingdom and the forces of darkness, as seen in <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>, where the dragon seeks to destroy God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assyrian_army.htm">The Assyrian Army</a></b><br>Led by King Sennacherib, the Assyrian forces were known for their military might and psychological warfare tactics, as seen in their attempt to intimidate the people of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his faithfulness to God and efforts to reform the religious practices of his people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under siege by the Assyrian army, representing the spiritual and political heart of the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_jerusalem.htm">The People of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the city who were the target of the Assyrian psychological warfare, standing on the wall as a defense against the invaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wall_of_jerusalem.htm">The Wall of Jerusalem</a></b><br>A significant defensive structure, symbolizing the physical and spiritual protection of the city.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>The Assyrians used language as a weapon to instill fear.
