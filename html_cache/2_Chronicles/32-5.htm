His resolve is reminiscent of other biblical figures who acted decisively in times of crisis, such as Nehemiah rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. This phrase highlights the importance of steadfastness and commitment in fulfilling God's purposes.<p><b>to rebuild all the broken sections of the wall</b><br>The walls of Jerusalem were crucial for the city's defense against invaders. Rebuilding them was not only a practical necessity but also a symbolic act of restoring strength and security. This mirrors the spiritual rebuilding that believers are called to undertake in their lives, repairing what is broken through faith and obedience.<p><b>and to raise up towers on it</b><br>Towers were strategic for defense, providing vantage points to spot approaching enemies. Spiritually, this can be seen as a call to vigilance and preparedness, echoing the New Testament exhortation to be watchful and stand firm in faith.<p><b>He also built an outer wall</b><br>The construction of an outer wall indicates a proactive approach to defense, expanding protection beyond the immediate city. This can be likened to the Christian's call to extend their influence and protection through evangelism and community engagement, safeguarding not just themselves but others as well.<p><b>and reinforced the supporting terraces of the City of David</b><br>The City of David, the oldest part of Jerusalem, held historical and spiritual significance as the original stronghold of King David. Reinforcing its terraces underscores the importance of maintaining and strengthening one's spiritual heritage and foundations, much like the call to uphold the teachings and traditions of the faith.<p><b>and he produced an abundance of weapons and shields</b><br>Hezekiah's preparation for battle by amassing weapons and shields signifies the necessity of being equipped for spiritual warfare. This parallels the New Testament imagery of the armor of God, emphasizing readiness and protection against spiritual adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his reforms to restore proper worship in Judah.

(See <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm" title="You made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but you have not looked to the maker thereof, neither had respect to him that fashioned it long ago.">Isaiah 22:11</a>, "the two walls.") . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He strengthened himself</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as in our several previous instances of the occurrence of the phrase (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/25-11.htm">2 Chronicles 25:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-8.htm">2 Chronicles 26:8</a>), he took all possible means to make himself and people and city strong to withstand the invader. <span class="cmt_word">All the wall that was broken</span> (see <a href="/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9</a>). Although we read that the devastation wrought by Joash (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-23.htm">2 Chronicles 25:23</a>) was very largely repaired by Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>) and by Jotham (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>), it is not explicitly said that the broken four hundred cubits of wall, from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, were made absolutely good again, although in the matter of towers and fortifications much was evidently done.

Discard this Authorized Version rendering. The meaning cannot be certainly pronounced upon, but perhaps it may be intended to say that he <span class="accented">heightened</span> the towers. The objection is that the same verb is wanted for the next clause, and that its rendering would need to be there slightly reduced again to a mere statement of raising from the ground (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> building) another <span class="cmt_word">wall without.
