The number twelve is also symbolic, often representing the twelve tribes of Israel, indicating completeness and divine order. The lions on the steps leading to Solomon's throne emphasize the king's power and the divine authority bestowed upon him. This imagery can be connected to the Lion of Judah, a title for Jesus Christ, symbolizing His ultimate authority and kingship.<p><b>one at either end of each step</b><br>The placement of the lions at either end of each step suggests a sense of balance and protection. This arrangement would have created a majestic and awe-inspiring approach to the throne, signifying the importance and sanctity of the king's position. The symmetry and order reflect the wisdom and careful planning attributed to Solomon's reign, as well as the divine order that God intended for His people.<p><b>Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom</b><br>This statement highlights the unparalleled grandeur and uniqueness of Solomon's throne. It underscores the wealth, wisdom, and divine favor that characterized Solomon's reign. Historically, Solomon's kingdom was renowned for its prosperity and splendor, attracting visitors like the Queen of Sheba.

(<a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The number twelve mirrors the twelve tribes of Israel, suggesting that Solomon&#8217;s throne represented the whole covenant nation, much as the precious stones on the high priest&#8217;s breastpiece did in <a href="/exodus/28-21.htm">Exodus 28:21</a>.<p>&#8226; The statement is factual; these were actual sculpted figures, crafted to proclaim that the king&#8217;s authority came from the LORD, whose own throne is described with similar grandeur in <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-4</a>.<p>&#8226;

Each step physically lifted the observer, picturing the spiritual truth that true authority is above us; <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a> asks, &#8220;Who may ascend the hill of the LORD?&#8221;<p>&#8226;

The detail also anticipates Christ&#8217;s promise that His followers will sit with Him on His throne (<a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>); entrance to that throne, too, is secured on both sides&#8212;by mercy and justice together (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom&#8221;&#8212;unmatched splendor</b><p>Scripture concludes, &#8220;Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom&#8221;.<p>&#8226;
