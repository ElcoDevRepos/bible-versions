This act was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and demonstrated Ahaz's lack of faith in Yahweh. The gods of Damascus were likely associated with Hadad, the storm god, and other deities worshiped in Aram.<p><b>who had defeated him</b><br>The Arameans had previously defeated Ahaz, as recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5</a>. This defeat was part of God's judgment against Ahaz for his unfaithfulness. The historical context shows that Ahaz sought help from Assyria rather than relying on God, leading to further subjugation and loss.<p><b>and he said, &#8220;Because the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them</b><br>Ahaz's reasoning reflects a syncretistic belief system, where he attributed military success to the power of foreign gods. This contrasts with the biblical teaching that the Lord alone is sovereign over all nations (<a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5-7</a>). Ahaz's statement reveals his spiritual blindness and misunderstanding of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.&#8221;</b><br>Ahaz's decision to sacrifice to these gods was an attempt to manipulate divine favor, a practice common in pagan religions but contrary to the worship of Yahweh, who desires obedience and faithfulness (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). This act further alienated him from God and led to greater spiritual and national decline.<p><b>But these gods were the downfall of Ahaz and of all Israel.</b><br>The worship of foreign gods led to Ahaz's downfall, fulfilling the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of idolatry. This phrase highlights the futility of trusting in false gods and serves as a reminder of the importance of exclusive devotion to the Lord.

That such was the common belief of the Israelites in the days of Ahaz appears certain. (See <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm" title="Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="/judges/11-24.htm" title="Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess?

If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.">1Samuel 26:19</a>.) In the latter half of Isaiah we find the nothingness of the false gods strongly asserted; but there was also another current opinion, which St. Paul repeats, and which Milton has adopted in <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost, </span>viz., that "the things which the heathen sacrifice, they sacrifice to <span class= "ital">demons</span>" (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.">1Corinthians 8:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-17.htm" title="They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him</span>. The writer must be understood to speak from the point of view of Ahaz, in putting it, that it was the gods of Damascus who smote." The formula, all Israel, is a clear instance of how the name "Israel" is used as "Judah." The <span class="accented">gods of Damascus</span> were, of course, the same with those of Syria, of which Damascus was capital. Their names were Rimmon, Tabrim-men, Hadad, and some others.
