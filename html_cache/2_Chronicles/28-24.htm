This act signifies a profound disrespect for the sanctity of the temple. Historically, the temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship, and its articles were considered holy. Ahaz's actions reflect his apostasy and departure from the faith of his ancestors, aligning with the practices of surrounding pagan nations.<p><b>cut them into pieces</b><br>By destroying these sacred items, Ahaz demonstrated a complete rejection of the worship of Yahweh. This act can be seen as a symbolic breaking of the covenant between God and Israel. It parallels the actions of other apostate kings in Israel's history who led the nation into idolatry, such as Jeroboam, who set up golden calves (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p><b>shut the doors of the house of the LORD</b><br>Closing the temple doors effectively halted the worship of Yahweh, preventing the people from offering sacrifices and seeking God&#8217;s presence.

It contrasts with the later reforms of Hezekiah, Ahaz's son, who reopened the temple and restored proper worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3</a>).<p><b>and set up altars of his own on every street corner in Jerusalem</b><br>Ahaz's establishment of altars throughout Jerusalem indicates a shift towards idolatry and syncretism, incorporating pagan practices into the religious life of Judah. This proliferation of altars reflects the influence of surrounding nations and their gods, such as the Canaanite deities. It also highlights the spiritual decay and the king's failure to lead the people in the ways of the Lord, contrasting with the centralized worship commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned during a time of spiritual decline.

Ahaz&#8217;s choices demonstrate how turning from God is never neutral; it dismantles the sacred and floods life with idols. The verse warns that when leaders shut God out, a nation&#8217;s spiritual lifelines are severed&#8212;but it also prepares the stage for God&#8217;s gracious restoration through Hezekiah, showing that the LORD still stands ready to reopen the doors to any heart that turns back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Gathered together the vessels.</span>--According to some MSS. the Syriac, Arabic, Vulg., and Targum, <span class= "ital">all </span>the vessels.<p><span class= "bld">And cut in pieces the vessels.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">trimmed </span>(<span class= "ital">qiccac</span>)<span class= "ital">, i.e., </span>cut off their metal ornaments. The same word is used in <a href="/2_kings/16-17.htm" title="And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it on the pavement of stones.">2Kings 16:17</a>, where it is said, "And king Ahaz cut off the plates of the bases, and removed the laver from upon them, and the sea he took down from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stones."<p><span class= "bld">And shut up the doors of the house of the Lord.</span>--Not in Kings.

The doors of the sanctuary itself, not those of the great court, must be understood. (Comp. <a href="/context/2_kings/16-15.htm" title="And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.">2Kings 16:15-16</a>, from which it appears that the new Syrian altar was erected in the inner court near the brazen altar.) By closing the doors Ahaz suspended all rites that could only be duly performed within the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. (Thenius thinks the verse involves a misunderstanding of <a href="/2_kings/16-18.htm" title="And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.">2Kings 16:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In every corner of </span>(<span class= "ital">in</span>) <span class= "bld">Jerusalem.</span>--Wanting in Kings. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - This verse (completed, indeed, by the verse following) heightens to its climax the description of the guilt of Ahaz, which grew to madness. Vers. 17, 18 of the parallel enlarge our view of what Ahaz did in the way of destruction, relating his mutilation of the bases and laver and sea, after also the displacement of the brazen altar in favour of that the pattern of which he had sent from Damascus to Urijah the priest, who must have been a consenting party to the iniquity. Our <a href="/2_chronicles/30-14.htm">2 Chronicles 30:14</a> speaks of the time that came when these wicked steps of king and priest began to be retraced, and, with the previous verses of same chapter, are the sad but interesting reverse of the present passage. The modern Jews commemorate, by the observance of a fast, this mournful crisis of Judah's history. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Ahaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1436;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_271.htm">Strong's 271: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahaz -- 'he has grasped', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gathered up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1505;&#1465;&#1448;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ye&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;s&#333;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
