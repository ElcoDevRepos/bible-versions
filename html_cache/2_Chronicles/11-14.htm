Their departure signifies a significant religious and cultural shift, as they abandoned their God-given inheritance. This act underscores the gravity of the situation under Jeroboam's rule, where the true worship of Yahweh was being compromised. The Levites' willingness to leave their possessions reflects their commitment to their priestly calling and the worship of the true God.<p><b>and went to Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>Judah and Jerusalem were the centers of true worship, with Jerusalem housing the Temple, the dwelling place of God's presence. The Levites' migration to Judah and Jerusalem highlights the division between the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. This move also emphasizes the centrality of Jerusalem in maintaining the worship of Yahweh, as prescribed in the Law of Moses. The Levites' relocation is a testament to their dedication to preserving the purity of worship and their rejection of idolatry.<p><b>because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the LORD</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, established alternative centers of worship in Bethel and Dan, appointing non-Levitical priests (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-31</a>). This rejection of the Levitical priesthood was a direct violation of God's commandments, which designated the Levites as the rightful priests (<a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-8</a>). Jeroboam's actions were politically motivated to prevent the people from returning to Jerusalem, thus solidifying his control over the northern kingdom.
