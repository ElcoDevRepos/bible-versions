His reign is noted for his military campaigns and his faithfulness to God. The Ammonites were a neighboring nation east of the Jordan River, often in conflict with Israel and Judah. This victory over the Ammonites demonstrates Jotham's strength and God's favor upon him. Historically, the Ammonites were descendants of Lot, and their land was often a point of contention. This victory can be seen as a continuation of the conflict between Israel and the Ammonites, which dates back to the time of the Judges (Judges 11).<p><b>and that year they gave him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand cors of barley</b><br>The tribute paid by the Ammonites signifies their subjugation and acknowledgment of Jotham's authority. A talent of silver was a significant amount, indicating the wealth and resources of the Ammonites. The cor was a large measure of dry goods, roughly equivalent to about 220 liters or 6 bushels. This payment in silver, wheat, and barley reflects the agricultural and economic practices of the time, where such goods were often used in trade and tribute. The tribute also highlights the prosperity of Jotham's reign and God's provision for Judah.<p><b>They paid him the same in the second and third years</b><br>The continued payment over three years suggests a sustained period of dominance and peace for Judah under Jotham's rule. This ongoing tribute indicates the stability and strength of Jotham's administration. It also reflects the political dynamics of the region, where vassal states would pay tribute to more powerful neighbors to maintain peace and avoid further conflict. This period of prosperity and peace can be seen as a blessing from God, aligning with the biblical theme that obedience to God leads to national blessing and security.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Uzziah, known for his righteous reign and military successes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel and Judah, descendants of Lot.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_ammonites.htm">King of the Ammonites</a></b><br>The ruler of the Ammonite people during Jotham's reign, who was defeated by Jotham.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jotham reigned as king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/war_and_tribute.htm">War and Tribute</a></b><br>The conflict between Jotham and the Ammonites, resulting in a tribute paid to Judah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_leadership.htm">Faithfulness in Leadership</a></b><br>Jotham's success against the Ammonites is attributed to his faithfulness to God.

Jotham, succeeding his father Uzziah, takes initiative rather than waiting for trouble to come to Judah. Like David facing the Philistines (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17&#8211;19</a>) and Asa confronting Zerah (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9&#8211;13</a>), righteous kings often act decisively, trusting the LORD for victory. His campaign also fulfills the earlier divine charge for Israel to subdue hostile neighbors (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and defeated them</b><p>The text credits Jotham with clear victory, echoing promises such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, &#8220;The LORD will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before you.&#8221; His success flows from the pattern in <a href="/2_chronicles/27-6.htm">2 Chronicles 27:6</a>, where he &#8220;ordered his ways before the LORD his God.&#8221; Unlike his father&#8217;s late&#8211;life pride (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>), Jotham&#8217;s humility leads to military triumph, much as Jehoshaphat&#8217;s reliance on God did (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and that year they gave him a hundred talents of silver</b><p>Tribute signals submission.

There is no note of time in the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He fought... the King of the Ammonites</span>. No allusion is made to the matter of this verse in the parallel, which contains a statement of the Syrian Rezin's attack or threatened invasion of Judah; as well as Pekah's, son of Remaliah King of Israel. Of the Ammonites' defeat by Uzziah we have just heard (foregoing chapter, ver. 8). A general statement is all that is made there of the gifts or tribute, they then had to pay. The present tribute was a heavy payment, and enforced for three, years. The "wheat" and "barley," in which payment was largely made bespeak the fertile arable quality of the Ammonite land, and this is noticed by travellers to the present day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/27-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Jotham]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
