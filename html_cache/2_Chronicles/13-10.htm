The declaration "the LORD is our God" reaffirms the monotheistic faith central to Israel's identity, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). This statement also reflects the faithfulness of King Abijah of Judah, who contrasts his kingdom's adherence to God with the apostasy of Jeroboam's Israel.<p><b>We have not forsaken Him;</b><br>This phrase underscores the commitment of Judah to remain faithful to the covenant with God, unlike the northern kingdom, which had abandoned the worship of Yahweh for golden calves (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). The idea of not forsaking God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where faithfulness is often linked to blessings and protection, while apostasy leads to judgment (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>the priests who minister to the LORD are sons of Aaron,</b><br>This highlights the legitimate priesthood in Judah, tracing their lineage back to Aaron, the brother of Moses, as prescribed in the Law (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). The Aaronic priesthood was essential for maintaining proper worship and sacrifices, which were central to the covenant relationship with God. In contrast, Jeroboam had appointed non-Levitical priests in Israel (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>), which was a direct violation of God's commandments.<p><b>and the Levites attend to their duties.</b><br>The Levites were set apart for service in the tabernacle and later the temple, assisting the priests and ensuring the proper conduct of worship (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). Their presence and service in Judah signify adherence to the divinely ordained order of worship. This phrase also reflects the broader theme of obedience to God's law, which is a hallmark of the faithful remnant throughout biblical history. The Levites' role can be seen as a type of Christ, who serves as the ultimate High Priest, mediating between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is speaking in this verse.

By reaffirming God&#8217;s identity, their own faithfulness, and the ordained priestly structure, Abijah insists that victory and blessing belong to those who cling to God&#8217;s revealed way.

"he walked in all the sins of his father," "his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God." But that passage is by no means incompatible with the present as some have asserted. What Abijah here states is surely true--viz.,that Judah had maintained the Levitical priesthood, and its associated worship.
