He is known for expanding the Assyrian Empire and implementing significant military and administrative reforms. His interactions with the kingdoms of Israel and Judah are well-documented in both biblical and Assyrian records. The Assyrian Empire, located in what is now northern Iraq, was a dominant force in the ancient Near East, and its kings often exerted influence over smaller neighboring states, including Israel and Judah.<p><b>came to Ahaz</b><br>Ahaz was the king of Judah from approximately 732 to 716 BC. His reign is noted for its political and religious challenges. Ahaz sought the help of Tiglath-pileser during a time of crisis, specifically when Judah was threatened by the combined forces of Israel and Aram (Syria). This alliance against Judah is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/16.htm">2 Kings 16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>. Ahaz's decision to seek Assyrian assistance reflects his lack of faith in God's protection, as he chose to rely on a foreign power rather than trust in the Lord.<p><b>but afflicted him rather than strengthening him</b><br>Instead of providing the support Ahaz hoped for, Tiglath-pileser imposed heavy burdens on Judah. This affliction likely included tribute demands and political subjugation, which weakened Judah's autonomy. The Assyrian king's actions fulfilled the warnings given by the prophet Isaiah, who cautioned against relying on foreign alliances (<a href="/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-25</a>). This outcome serves as a reminder of the dangers of placing trust in human powers rather than in God. The affliction of Ahaz by Tiglath-pileser can be seen as a form of divine judgment for Ahaz's unfaithfulness and idolatry, as he led Judah away from the worship of Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tiglath-pileser_iii.htm">Tiglath-pileser III</a></b><br>The king of Assyria during the reign of Ahaz.

Tiglath-pileser III, a real historical figure recorded in both Scripture and Assyrian annals, marched south. From a human standpoint, the move looked shrewd; powerful allies seem attractive when enemies close in. Yet Isaiah had already counseled Ahaz, &#8220;If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a>).<p>Key takeaways<p>&#8226; Alliances that bypass God promise help but demand a price (<a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith is tested most when danger looms.

Tiglath-pileser stripped Judah of wealth, imposed tribute, and tightened his grip (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10&#8211;18</a>). Rather than delivering, the &#8220;protector&#8221; became an oppressor&#8212;fulfilling the pattern God warns about in <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>: &#8220;Cursed is the man who trusts in man.&#8221;<p>What affliction looked like<p>&#8226; Economic drain&#8212;temple gold, palace silver, and national treasures handed over.<p>&#8226; Spiritual erosion&#8212;Ahaz remodeled the temple after a pagan altar seen in Damascus (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Political bondage&#8212;Judah slid from sovereignty to vassal status.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>rather than strengthening him</b><p>Ahaz expected military security, but Assyria never fought Judah&#8217;s battles; it merely neutralized her independence. The contrast could not be sharper: God had promised past kings, &#8220;The LORD is with you when you are with Him&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>). Because Ahaz rejected that covenant, God allowed the very tool Ahaz trusted to become His rod of discipline (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>). The &#8220;strength&#8221; Ahaz sought turned into weakness (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-5</a>).<p>Practical insights<p>&#8226; Any refuge other than God eventually proves hollow.<p>&#8226; Compromise for short-term relief invites long-term loss.<p>&#8226; God alone supplies true strength; substitutes deteriorate into chains (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20</a> shows the tragic irony of relying on human power instead of the LORD.

The verse reminds us that safety apart from God is an illusion, and that obedience, not political maneuvering, secures lasting strength.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Tilgath-pilneser</span> (Heb., <span class= "ital">Pilne'eser</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In 2 Kings more correctly called <span class= "ital">Tiglath-pileser</span> (<span class= "ital">Pil'eser</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> (See Note on <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm" title="And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.">1Chronicles 5:26</a>.) According to the As syrian Eponym Canon, Tiglath-pileser II. came to the throne B.C. 745, and marched westward against Damascus and Israel, B.C. 734. The importance of these dates for the chronology of the period is obvious.<p><span class= "bld">Came unto him.</span>--Comp. the more detailed narrative in <a href="/context/2_kings/16-7.htm" title="So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.">2Kings 16:7-10</a>; and see Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/28-16.htm" title="At that time did king Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria to help him.">2Chronicles 28:16</a>. Tiglath was induced by the message and present of Ahaz to undertake a campaign in the west; he captured Damascus, slew Rezin, and transported the population of the city to Kir (Kings, <span class= "ital">l.c.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> After this, "king Ahaz went to Damascus <span class= "ital">to meet</span> Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria" (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10</a>). The chronicler in the words before us, is estimating the results of this expedition as they affected the interests of Judah. At the prayer of Ahaz the Assyrian had indeed "come to him"; but not with any purpose of strengthening the southern kingdom. Glad of a pretext for interference in the affairs of the west, the ambitious usurper was simply bent on the extension of his own empire; and when the more powerful states of Syria and Israel lay at his feet, he naturally proceeded to require a most unequivocal acknowledgment of vassalage from Ahaz. He thus "distressed" or oppressed him by reducing his kingdom to a mere dependency of Assyria, besides impoverishing him of all his treasure, which Ahaz had sent as the price of this ruinous help.<p><span class= "bld">Distressed him, but strengthened him not.</span>--This is correct. A possible rendering is: "and besieged him, and conquered him not"; but the context is against it. (The word <span class= "ital">chazaq,</span> "strengthened," everywhere else means <span class= "ital">to be strong,</span> or, <span class= "ital">to prevail.</span> LXX. omits the last words, rendering the whole <span class= "greekheb">??? ???????? ?????</span><span class= "ital">.</span> Syriac and Arabic, "besieged him." The Vulg. has: "et afflixit eum, et nullo resistente vastavit." That Judah now became tributary to Assyria is evident from <a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm" title="And the LORD was with him; and he prospered wherever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.">2Kings 18:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.">2Kings 18:14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-20.htm" title="You say, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war.

This is in our writer's usual deeper moral and religious vein, and was no doubt most true. For all Ahaz paid and bribed out of the sacrilegiously employed treasure of the temple, out of the depreciating and partial dismantling of "the house of the king," and out of the begged contributions or taxes extortionately wrung "of the princes" (see the succinct account of next verse, and compare the parallel in its vers. 8, 18), he bought a master for himself, servitude, tributariness, and the humiliation of disgrace itself. The temporary relief he obtained (and which the writer of Chronicles in no way means to deny) from one enemy rivetted round his neck the yoke of another and greater. And worse than this, he secured in his own heart the greatest adversary of all - a restless, implacable foe, which ever goaded him on to worse folly and deeper sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Tiglath-pileser</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1430;&#1505;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(pil&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;ser)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8407.htm">Strong's 8407: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tiglath-pileser -- an Assyrian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Assyria</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;&#353;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_804.htm">Strong's 804: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ashshur</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
