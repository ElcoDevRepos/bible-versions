Manasseh was the king of Judah, known for his idolatry and evil practices, which included rebuilding high places, erecting altars to Baal, and even sacrificing his own son. The LORD's speaking suggests prophetic intervention, likely through prophets like Isaiah, who were active during this period. This reflects God's patience and desire for repentance, consistent with His character throughout the Old Testament. The phrase also highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God continually reaches out to guide and correct His people.<p><b>but they did not listen</b><br>This phrase underscores the persistent disobedience and hard-heartedness of Manasseh and the people of Judah. Despite God's warnings, they continued in their sinful ways. This reflects a recurring theme in the history of Israel, where the people often turned away from God despite His repeated calls to repentance. The refusal to listen is a significant factor leading to Judah's eventual downfall and exile, as prophesied in earlier scriptures. This disobedience contrasts with the ideal response to God's word, which is obedience and faithfulness, as seen in the lives of faithful leaders like King David. The phrase serves as a warning about the consequences of ignoring God's voice, a theme echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus calls for ears to hear and hearts to understand.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his idolatry and leading the nation into sin.
