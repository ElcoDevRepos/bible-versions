The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting that he joined his ancestors in the afterlife. Manasseh's reign was marked by significant idolatry and evil practices, as detailed earlier in <a href="/2_chronicles/33.htm">2 Chronicles 33</a>, but he also experienced a late repentance. His death marks the end of a tumultuous period in Judah's history. The phrase also implies a return to the covenant community, as he is counted among his forefathers despite his earlier sins.<p><b>and was buried at his palace.</b><br>Unlike many kings who were buried in the City of David, Manasseh was buried at his palace. This could suggest a deviation from tradition, possibly due to his controversial reign or personal choice. The location of his burial might reflect his status or the influence he wielded during his lifetime. Archaeologically, the exact location of his palace is not definitively known, but it would have been in Jerusalem, the capital of Judah. This burial site choice might also indicate a desire for a more private or personal resting place.<p><b>And his son Amon reigned in his place.</b><br>Amon succeeded Manasseh as king, continuing the Davidic line. His reign was short, lasting only two years, and he followed in the early footsteps of his father by committing evil in the sight of the Lord, as described in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-21.htm">2 Chronicles 33:21-23</a>. Amon's reign is a reminder of the cyclical nature of sin and repentance in the history of Judah's kings. His ascension to the throne signifies the continuation of the royal lineage, which is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises to David regarding an everlasting dynasty, ultimately realized in Jesus Christ, the descendant of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially led the nation into idolatry but later repented and sought the Lord.

His peaceful death confirms God&#8217;s mercy: sin was forgiven, fellowship with the Lord renewed, and he could &#8220;rest&#8221; without fear (<a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1-2</a>; <a href="/psalms/116-7.htm">Psalm 116:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was buried at his palace</b><p>&#8226; Unlike many kings interred in the City of David, Manasseh chose burial near his own house (<a href="/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18</a>).<p>&#8226; This private burial may underline humility after repentance&#8212;no grand public tomb, just a quiet grave near the place where he had learned hard lessons of faith.<p>&#8226; It also demonstrates that genuine repentance affects even end-of-life choices, aligning personal legacy with a changed heart (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His son Amon reigned in his place</b><p>&#8226; Dynastic succession fulfills God&#8217;s promise that David&#8217;s line would endure (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-18.htm">2 Chronicles 7:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Amon &#8220;did evil&#8221; and quickly met judgment (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-21.htm">2 Chronicles 33:21-24</a>). This contrast warns every generation that faith is not inherited; each heart must respond to God personally (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>; <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The seamless transfer of power also shows God&#8217;s sovereign hand guiding history toward Messiah, preserving the royal line despite human failings (<a href="/matthew/1-10.htm">Matthew 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/33-20.htm">2 Chronicles 33:20</a> records three simple facts&#8212;Manasseh&#8217;s peaceful death, humble burial, and Amon&#8217;s accession&#8212;but behind them lies a rich testimony. God&#8217;s mercy transformed Manasseh from rebel to redeemed, granting him rest. His modest burial reflects a repentant heart. Amon&#8217;s rise reminds us that every generation must choose obedience.
