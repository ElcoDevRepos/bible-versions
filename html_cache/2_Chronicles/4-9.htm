This separation underscores the holiness required for those serving directly in God's presence. The courtyard's construction reflects the detailed instructions given for the tabernacle in Exodus, emphasizing the continuity of worship practices from the wilderness to the established temple. The priests' courtyard symbolizes the mediatory role of the priesthood, which foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates between God and humanity.<p><b>and the large court with its doors</b><br>The large court, also known as the outer court, was accessible to the Israelites who came to worship. It represents the inclusivity of God's covenant people, allowing them to participate in worship and sacrifices. The presence of doors signifies both access and separation, indicating that while God is approachable, there are boundaries to His holiness. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to Himself as the "door" (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>), providing access to the Father.<p><b>and he overlaid the doors with bronze</b><br>Bronze, a durable and valuable metal, was often used in the construction of sacred objects and spaces, symbolizing strength and judgment. The overlaying of the doors with bronze signifies the enduring nature of God's covenant and the strength required to uphold His laws. In biblical symbolism, bronze is associated with judgment and purification, as seen in the bronze altar used for sacrifices. This foreshadows Christ's role in bearing judgment and providing purification for sin through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.

Third, the bronze-clad doors proclaim that access is secured only where judgment has fallen and atonement is made.
