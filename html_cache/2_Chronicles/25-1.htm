This age suggests a level of maturity and readiness for leadership, as he would have been groomed for kingship under his father, Joash. The age of twenty-five is significant in biblical terms, as it often represents a time of readiness and responsibility, seen in other contexts such as the age Levites began their service (<a href="/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>).<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years</b><br>Amaziah's reign of twenty-nine years indicates a relatively stable period in Judah's history, though not without its challenges. Jerusalem, the capital city, was the political and spiritual center of Judah, housing the Temple built by Solomon. His reign included both military campaigns and religious reforms, though his later years were marked by pride and eventual downfall. The length of his reign suggests a period of relative peace and prosperity, though it ended in conflict and assassination.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem</b><br>The mention of Jehoaddan, Amaziah's mother, highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the Davidic line. Her origin from Jerusalem suggests a connection to the heart of Judah's religious and cultural life. This detail underscores the significance of Jerusalem not only as a political center but also as a place of spiritual heritage. The inclusion of maternal names in the biblical narrative often points to the influence of the mother in the king's life and reign, reflecting the cultural importance of family lineage and heritage in ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Amaziah was the king of Judah.

Amaziah&#8217;s ascent reflects God&#8217;s hand guiding Judah&#8217;s throne, just as <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> affirms divine appointment of authorities.<p>&#8226; The chronicle links directly to <a href="/2_kings/14-1.htm">2 Kings 14:1&#8211;2</a>, tying together the unified testimony of Scripture.<p>&#8226; By noting the transition without drama, the writer highlights a season of relative stability following the turbulent coup against Amaziah&#8217;s father, Joash (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he reigned in Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; Jerusalem is more than geography; it is &#8220;the city the LORD had chosen for His Name&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>). Amaziah&#8217;s rule is anchored where God placed His temple and promised His presence (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase points to covenant continuity. Despite Judah&#8217;s ups and downs, the throne remains in David&#8217;s city, fulfilling <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>.<p>&#8226; Leadership from Jerusalem carried sacred obligations&#8212;protecting worship, upholding justice (<a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Twenty-nine years</b><p>&#8226; &#8220; &#8216;&#8230;and he reigned &#8230; twenty-nine years.&#8217; &#8221; God tallies every year. Long enough for sustained policy, yet short compared with his son Uzziah&#8217;s fifty-two-year reign (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-3.htm">2 Chronicles 26:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The number invites reflection: length of life or office is in God&#8217;s hands (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>). Amaziah&#8217;s reign ends abruptly after he turns from wholehearted obedience (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14&#8211;16, 27</a>).<p>&#8226; Compare Jehoram&#8217;s eight years of misery (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>) and Asa&#8217;s forty-one years of mixed faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-13.htm">2 Chronicles 16:13</a>). Longevity alone is not the measure; faithfulness is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jehoaddan</b><p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly records the mothers of Judah&#8217;s kings (e.g., <a href="/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>), underscoring maternal influence on covenant heritage.<p>&#8226; Jehoaddan&#8217;s name, included by the Spirit, signals that God sees and values mothers shaping future leaders (<a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>).<p>&#8226; While Amaziah&#8217;s later compromise is his own, a godly mother&#8217;s impact can still be profound&#8212;as with King Hezekiah&#8217;s mother, Abijah (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-1.htm">2 Chronicles 29:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She was from Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; Rooted in the holy city, Jehoaddan likely grew up under the rhythms of temple worship.

Each detail reveals God&#8217;s sovereignty: raising a young man to lead, anchoring him in covenant Jerusalem, granting nearly three decades to choose obedience, and shaping him through a mother rooted in the holy city. The verse reminds us that every season of leadership and every family influence matters, because the Lord who records our days calls us to wholehearted faithfulness in them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XXV.<p>THE REIGN OF AMAZIAH.</span> (Comp. <a href="/context/2_kings/14-1.htm" title="In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.">2Kings 14:1-20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">DURATION AND CHARACTER OF THE REIGN.

The reference to Joash is omitted, perhaps because that king appears to less advantage in the Chronicles than ill Kings. In fact, the chronicler's estimate of both princes is less favourable than that of the older historian. Such differences are perfectly natural, and it is needless to attempt to "reconcile" or eliminate them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty and five years old...</span> <span class="cmt_word">reigned twenty and nine years.</span> Glance at notes on vers. 1, 15, 17 of foregoing chapter, from which it appears that, as Joash died <span class="accented">aetat.</span> forty-seven, and Amaziah was now twenty-five, he must have been born when his father was twenty-two years old, and <span class="cmt_word">Jehoaddan</span> correspondingly likely to have been one of the two wives Jehoiada selected for Joash, at the age, on <span class="accented">other</span> data, of twenty-one years. <span class="cmt_word">Of Jerusalem</span>.
