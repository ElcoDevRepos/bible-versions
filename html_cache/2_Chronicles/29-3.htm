The first month, Nisan, is significant in the Jewish calendar as it marks the beginning of the religious year, aligning with the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>). Hezekiah's actions reflect a commitment to restoring proper worship from the outset of his reign, contrasting with the idolatrous practices of his father, Ahaz (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">2 Chronicles 28:24</a>). This urgency underscores the importance of spiritual renewal and sets a precedent for leadership that prioritizes faithfulness to God.<p><b>Hezekiah opened and repaired the doors of the house of the LORD</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites, had been neglected and desecrated under Ahaz, who closed its doors and set up altars to foreign gods (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">2 Chronicles 28:24-25</a>). By opening and repairing the doors, Hezekiah was not only restoring physical access but also symbolically reopening the nation's relationship with God. This act of restoration is reminiscent of the call to repentance and renewal found throughout the Old Testament, such as in the reforms of Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-7</a>) and the rebuilding efforts of Ezra and Nehemiah (<a href="/ezra/6-14.htm">Ezra 6:14-15</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17-18</a>). The temple's restoration can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator and restorer of the relationship between God and humanity (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>Hezekiah was the king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship of Yahweh.
