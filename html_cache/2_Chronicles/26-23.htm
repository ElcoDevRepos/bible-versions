It reflects the Hebrew tradition of being gathered to one's ancestors, implying a continuation of lineage and heritage. Uzziah's reign was marked by both prosperity and downfall due to his pride, as detailed in <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>.<p><b>and was buried near them in a field of burial that belonged to the kings</b><br>Uzziah was not buried in the royal tombs due to his leprosy, a condition that rendered him ceremonially unclean. This burial "near" rather than "with" the kings signifies a separation due to his condition, reflecting the cultural and religious practices concerning purity and burial rites. The field of burial indicates a designated area for royal burials, emphasizing the honor of his position despite his affliction.<p><b>for the people said, &#8220;He was a leper.&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights the public acknowledgment of Uzziah's leprosy, which was seen as a divine judgment for his attempt to burn incense in the temple, an act reserved for priests (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>). Leprosy in biblical times was not only a physical ailment but also carried social and religious stigma, often interpreted as a sign of God's displeasure.<p><b>And his son Jotham reigned in his place.</b><br>Jotham's succession marks the continuation of the Davidic line, a key theme in Chronicles. Jotham is noted for his righteous reign, contrasting with his father's downfall. His rule is seen as a stabilizing period, and he is commended for his faithfulness to God (<a href="/2_chronicles/27.htm">2 Chronicles 27:1-6</a>).
