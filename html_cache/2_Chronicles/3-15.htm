These pillars were not structural but served as monumental symbols. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, such pillars often represented the presence and power of the deity worshiped within. The placement in front of the temple signifies the importance of these pillars as markers of divine presence and authority. The names Jachin and Boaz can be interpreted as "He will establish" and "In Him is strength," respectively, reflecting God's covenant promises to Israel.<p><b>which together were thirty-five cubits high</b><br>The combined height of thirty-five cubits (approximately 52 feet) indicates the grandeur and majesty of the temple's entrance. This height would have made the pillars a prominent feature visible from a distance, drawing attention to the temple as the center of worship and the dwelling place of God. The use of cubits, an ancient measurement, reflects the historical context of the construction period. The height also emphasizes the temple's significance as a place of divine-human encounter.<p><b>each with a capital on top measuring five cubits</b><br>The capitals, or decorative tops of the pillars, measured five cubits (about 7.5 feet) and were likely adorned with intricate designs, possibly including pomegranates and lilies, as described in other biblical passages. These capitals added to the aesthetic beauty and symbolic meaning of the pillars. In biblical symbolism, pomegranates often represent fruitfulness and abundance, while lilies can symbolize purity. The capitals' height and decoration further highlight the temple's splendor and the glory of God it was meant to reflect.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.

Of the versions, the LXX. and Vulg. have "thirty-five;" the Syriac and Arabic, "eighteen." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty and five cubits</span>. The height of these pillars is attested in three places to have been 18 cubits (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>). Some therefore think that the height given in our text describes rather the distance of the one pillar from the other, which would be just 35 cubits, if they stood at the extreme points of the line of the porch front; since the wings on each side (5 cubits for the lowest chamber, and 2.5 cubits for the thickness of the walls) would make up this amount. It is further noticed with this explanation that their height (18 cubits) with the chapiters (5 cubits) added, would bring them to the same height as the porch, and that their ornamentation agrees with that of the porch (<a href="/1_kings/7-19.htm">1 Kings 7:19</a>). All this may be the case. Yet considering other indications of uncertainty about our text, and the fact that the characters <span class="accented">yod kheth</span> (18) are easily superseded by <span class="accented">lamed he</span> (35), it is perhaps likelier that we have here simply a clerical error. The parallel place tells us that these pillars and the chapiters were cast of brass; that "a line [<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>; Jeremiah 52:41] of twelve cubits [not seven] did compass either of them about;" that the ornamentation of each chapiter was "a net of checker-work, and a wreath of chain-work;" that upon the five cubits of chapiter there was another "four cubits of lily-work," etc. If this last feature apply to the two pillars, and not (as some think) to the porch only, the pillars would reach a height of 27 cubits, and if it be supposed that they stood on some stone or other superstructure, it may still be that our "thirty-five cubits" has its meaning. Meantime the passage in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 52:41) tells us that the pillars were hollow, and that the thickness of the metal was "four fingers." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In front</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
