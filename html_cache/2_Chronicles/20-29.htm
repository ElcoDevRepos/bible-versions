The "fear of God" refers to a profound respect and awe, often accompanied by dread, that other nations experienced upon witnessing God's power. This fear is not merely emotional but acknowledges God's sovereignty and might. Historically, the ancient Near East was a region of numerous small kingdoms and city-states, each with its own deities. The demonstration of God's power over Israel's enemies would have been a significant event, challenging the prevailing belief systems and asserting the supremacy of the God of Israel. This fear is reminiscent of the fear that fell upon the nations during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>) and the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine intervention in the battle, emphasizing that it was the LORD, not merely the military might of Israel, who secured the victory. The term "LORD" (YHWH) is the covenant name of God, highlighting His personal relationship with Israel. The historical context involves King Jehoshaphat's reign, where God delivered Judah from a coalition of Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites without the need for battle (<a href="/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-30</a>). This miraculous victory would have been a powerful testimony to surrounding nations, reinforcing the idea that Israel's God was actively involved in the affairs of His people. This divine intervention is a type of Christ, who fights on behalf of His people, securing victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>). The event also echoes the prophetic assurance found in <a href="/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11-13</a>, where God promises to contend with those who contend with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who led the nation in seeking God through prayer and fasting when faced with a vast enemy army.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, under threat from a coalition of enemy nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who intervened miraculously to deliver Judah from their enemies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemies_of_israel.htm">The Enemies of Israel</a></b><br>A coalition of Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites who came to make war against Jehoshaphat and Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdoms_of_the_lands.htm">The Kingdoms of the Lands</a></b><br>Neighboring nations who witnessed God's deliverance of Judah and were struck with fear.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer_and_fasting.htm">The Power of Prayer and Fasting</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's response to crisis was to seek God through prayer and fasting, demonstrating the importance of turning to God in times of trouble.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_intervention.htm">God's Sovereign Intervention</a></b><br>The miraculous deliverance of Judah shows that God is actively involved in the affairs of His people and can intervene in supernatural ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_witness_of_god's_power.htm">The Witness of God's Power</a></b><br>When God acts on behalf of His people, it serves as a testimony to others, instilling reverence and fear of the Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat and Judah chose faith over fear, trusting in God's promises and power rather than succumbing to the intimidation of their enemies.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_god's_deliverance.htm">The Impact of God's Deliverance</a></b><br>The fear that fell upon the surrounding nations highlights how God's deliverance can have a ripple effect, influencing those beyond the immediate situation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_20_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 20:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_20_29_God_s_power_over_foes.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 20:29 demonstrate God's power over Israel's enemies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Fear_of_God_in_2_Chronicles_20_29.htm">What role does fear of God play in 2 Chronicles 20:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_God_s_fear_daily_2.htm">How can we apply the fear of God in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Bible_stories_of_God_s_protection.htm">What other Bible stories show God's protection over His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_sovereignty_today_3.htm">How can we trust God's sovereignty in our personal battles today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_20_29_shows_God_s_power_over_nations.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 20:29 demonstrate God's power over nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_2_Chronicles_20_29_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events in 2 Chronicles 20:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_20_29_shows_God_s_protection.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 20:29 reflect God's protection of His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_believer.htm">What does the Bible say about worshiping pastors?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_no_extrabiblical_record_of_fear.htm">(2 Chronicles 17:10) If surrounding nations truly feared the Lord due to Jehoshaphat, why is there no clear extrabiblical historical record of this widespread fear?

After the Red Sea, &#8220;the peoples have heard; they tremble&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; This fear is not mere superstition; it is an awakened awareness that the God of Israel is real, active, and unstoppable&#8212;prompting respect, restraint, and sometimes even repentance (see <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments occurred in Jehoshaphat&#8217;s earlier reforms: &#8220;The terror of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10</a>). God consistently protects His people in ways that make surrounding nations take notice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>upon all the kingdoms of the lands</b><p>&#8226; The phrase stresses scope. No regional deity is in view; the universal King is. From Philistia to Edom, every neighbor felt the shock wave.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/35-5.htm">Genesis 35:5</a> records a comparable blanket effect: &#8220;A terror from God fell upon the towns all around them.&#8221; When God moves, boundaries blur and entire cultures feel the impact.<p>&#8226; For believers today, this reminds us that God&#8217;s reach is never confined; He still shapes global events to fulfill His purposes (<a href="/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when they heard</b><p>&#8226; News traveled fast in the ancient world&#8212;through traders, envoys, and refugees. Reports of supernatural victory spread like wildfire (<a href="/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-7.htm">1 Samuel 4:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith comes by hearing (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>), but so can fear. The nations did not need to see the battlefield; the testimony alone was convincing.<p>&#8226; Our witness functions the same way: as we recount God&#8217;s faithfulness, listeners realize He is alive and active.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel</b><p>&#8226; The context (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1&#8211;24</a>) is Jehoshaphat&#8217;s impossible situation against a vast coalition. Israel&#8217;s army merely took their positions; God turned the enemy on itself.<p>&#8226; This fulfills His promise: &#8220;The LORD your God is the One who goes with you to fight for you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar scenes appear throughout Scripture:<p>&#8211; <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, Red Sea: &#8220;The LORD will fight for you.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/joshua/10-42.htm">Joshua 10:42</a>, conquest of Canaan.<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>, the angel who struck the Assyrian camp.<p>&#8226; The message is unmistakable: God defends His covenant people, and hostile forces are no match for Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/20-29.htm">2 Chronicles 20:29</a> records the aftershock of divine intervention. God&#8217;s decisive action on Judah&#8217;s behalf produced a holy fear that engulfed every surrounding kingdom, proving His sovereignty and safeguarding His people without a sword being raised. What He did then affirms what He still does today: He fights for His own, magnifies His name among the nations, and turns even the fiercest opposition into an opportunity for His glory to be heard and revered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">And the fear of God was.</span>--<span class= "ital">And a divine dread fell upon all the kingdoms of the countries</span> (scil.) around Judah.
