The "pillar" likely refers to a designated place in the temple where kings would make significant proclamations or covenants. This act symbolizes authority and a public declaration of commitment. The temple in Jerusalem was the center of worship and national identity for the Israelites, making this location significant for such a covenant.<p><b>and made a covenant before the LORD</b><br>A covenant in biblical terms is a solemn agreement or promise, often involving commitments and obligations. Josiah's covenant was made "before the LORD," indicating its sacred nature and the seriousness with which it was undertaken. This reflects the biblical tradition of leaders renewing the nation's commitment to God, similar to covenants made by Moses and Joshua.<p><b>to follow the LORD</b><br>This commitment to "follow the LORD" emphasizes obedience and loyalty to God. In the context of Israel's history, this was a call to return to the worship of Yahweh alone, rejecting idolatry and syncretism that had crept into the nation. It echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which calls for exclusive devotion to God.<p><b>and to keep His commandments, decrees, and statutes</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the covenant, covering all aspects of the law given to Moses. Commandments, decrees, and statutes refer to the various types of laws found in the Torah, including moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. Josiah's commitment reflects a desire to restore the nation to covenant faithfulness as outlined in the Mosaic Law.<p><b>with all his heart and all his soul</b><br>This expression indicates total devotion and sincerity. It is reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. This level of commitment is not merely external compliance but involves inner transformation and wholehearted dedication.<p><b>and to carry out the words of the covenant that were written in this book</b><br>The "book" refers to the Book of the Law, likely a portion of Deuteronomy, discovered during temple repairs. This discovery sparked a religious reform led by Josiah. The emphasis on "carrying out" the words highlights the importance of not just hearing or reading the law but actively living it out. This aligns with the biblical theme of faith being demonstrated through actions, as seen in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Josiah was the king of Judah who initiated significant religious reforms.
