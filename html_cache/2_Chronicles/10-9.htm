This reflects a common practice among ancient Near Eastern kings who often relied on a council of elders or advisors for decision-making. The act of seeking advice indicates a moment of potential humility or uncertainty in leadership, contrasting with the wisdom of his father, Solomon, who was known for his discernment.<p><b>&#8220;What message do you advise</b><br>Rehoboam is inquiring about the best course of action in response to the people's request. This highlights the importance of communication and the power of words in leadership. The phrasing suggests a deliberative process, yet it also foreshadows the potential for poor judgment, as the advice he ultimately follows leads to division.<p><b>that we send back to these people</b><br>The "people" refers to the Israelites, particularly those from the northern tribes. This moment is pivotal as it addresses the growing discontent among the tribes, which had been simmering under Solomon's heavy taxation and labor demands. The phrase underscores the collective nature of the request and the expectation of a response from the king.<p><b>who have spoken to me, saying,</b><br>The people have directly addressed Rehoboam, indicating a formal petition. This reflects the cultural and historical context where subjects could appeal to their king for redress. It also shows the people's desire for a change in policy, emphasizing their agency and the seriousness of their grievances.<p><b>&#8216;Lighten the yoke your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221;</b><br>The "yoke" symbolizes the burdensome policies of Solomon, including forced labor and heavy taxation, which were used to support his extensive building projects and lavish lifestyle. This request for relief is a critical moment that tests Rehoboam's leadership. The imagery of the yoke is significant throughout Scripture, often representing oppression or servitude, and contrasts with Jesus' invitation in <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29-30</a> to take on His easy yoke. This request for a lighter burden foreshadows the eventual division of the kingdom, as Rehoboam's response will determine the unity or fracture of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.

His request for advice shows that even a king recognizes the need for counsel, echoing <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, &#8220;Victory is won through many advisers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet the shift in audience is telling. The elders had firsthand experience under Solomon; these younger friends shared Rehoboam&#8217;s privileged upbringing. The text reminds us that where we seek counsel shapes the answers we receive&#8212;<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a> warns, &#8220;He who walks with the wise will be wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What message do you advise that we send back</b><p>&#8226; Rehoboam frames his query around messaging, not morality or justice. He wants to craft a reply, not necessarily find the right course. Compare <a href="/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6&#8211;7</a>, where the elders recommend becoming &#8220;servants&#8221; to the people for their good; the focus there is service, not spin.<p>&#8226; The phrasing hints at political calculation. <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a> observes, &#8220;Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.&#8221; Success, however, depends on listening to godly counsel, not merely multiple voices.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To these people who have spoken to me</b><p>&#8226; Rehoboam distances himself from &#8220;these people,&#8221; the very Israelites he must shepherd. Good rulers identify with their flock, as David did (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>). Moses likewise interceded for Israel, calling them &#8220;Your people&#8221; before the Lord (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s tone foreshadows the division that will soon erupt (<a href="/2_chronicles/10-16.htm">2 Chronicles 10:16</a>). <a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a> cautions, &#8220;The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to counsel.&#8221; A listening posture could have held the kingdom together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saying, &#8216;Lighten the yoke your father put on us&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s building projects and administrative expansion brought heavy taxation and forced labor (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20&#8211;28</a>; 5:13&#8211;18). While prosperous, the people felt the strain. Their plea was neither unreasonable nor rebellious&#8212;<a href="/deuteronomy/17-20.htm">Deuteronomy 17:20</a> expected kings to avoid lifting themselves above their brothers.<p>&#8226; God had forewarned Israel that a human king might impose a &#8220;heavy yoke&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10&#8211;18</a>). The contrast with Christ is striking: Jesus invites, &#8220;My yoke is easy and My burden is light&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; Rehoboam stands at a crossroads. Lightening the load could model servant leadership and preserve unity; tightening it will fracture the nation and fulfill the prophetic word spoken to Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Rehoboam&#8217;s simple-sounding request exposes deep issues: whose counsel he values, how he views God&#8217;s people, and whether he will rule as a servant or a tyrant. By asking peers rather than seasoned elders, he sets the stage for disaster. The verse challenges every reader in positions of influence to seek wise counsel, empathize with those they lead, and imitate the Servant-King who lifts burdens rather than adding to them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And he said unto them.</span>--The verse agrees with Kings to the letter.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/10-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
