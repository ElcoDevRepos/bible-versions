The capture of 10,000 men signifies a significant military victory for Judah. Historically, the Edomites were descendants of Esau and often in conflict with Israel and Judah. This capture demonstrates the might of Judah's army and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them victory over their enemies when they obeyed His commands. The number 10,000 is often used in the Bible to denote a large, complete number, indicating the totality of the victory.<p><b>They took them to the top of a cliff</b><br>The geographical setting is likely in the region of Seir, the mountainous territory of the Edomites. The mention of a cliff suggests a strategic location, possibly a high place used for military advantage or execution. In ancient warfare, high places were often used for their strategic visibility and defensibility. The act of taking captives to a cliff indicates a premeditated decision to execute them in a manner that would serve as a warning to others.<p><b>and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.</b><br>This phrase describes a brutal method of execution, reflecting the harsh realities of ancient warfare. The act of throwing captives from a cliff was not only a means of execution but also a demonstration of power and a deterrent to future rebellion. In the cultural context, such actions were not uncommon in ancient Near Eastern warfare, where complete victory often involved the annihilation of enemy forces. This act can be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment against Edom, as prophesied in Obadiah and other prophetic books, where Edom's pride and hostility towards Israel would lead to their downfall. The severity of this action underscores the seriousness of disobedience to God and the consequences of opposing His chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the military campaign against the Edomites.

The large number of prisoners underscores how decisively the Lord granted success when Judah trusted Him (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Taking the men alive shows that the triumph was total&#8212;Edom&#8217;s resistance was broken. The detail echoes earlier occasions when Israel captured foes en masse, such as Gideon with the Midianite princes (<a href="/judges/8-12.htm">Judges 8:12</a>) and David with the Moabites (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative makes clear that the power behind Judah&#8217;s victory is the Lord, not mere military strategy (2 Chron 16:8).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They took them to the top of a cliff</b><p>&#8226; The parallel account in <a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a> specifies the location as &#8220;the Valley of Salt,&#8221; identifying a steep ridge near present-day southern Dead Sea. The scene recalls other moments when geography became an instrument of divine judgment&#8212;e.g., the collapse of Jericho&#8217;s walls (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>) and the hail on the Amorites at Beth-horon (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Moving the prisoners to a high precipice signals an intentional, judicial act rather than battlefield chaos. It fulfills the principle that God sometimes uses His covenant nation as the agent of judgment on persistent evil (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And threw them down</b><p>&#8226; The action is graphic and deliberate. Scripture doesn&#8217;t soften the realities of war; it records them to teach that sin has severe consequences (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The method evokes <a href="/psalms/137-9.htm">Psalm 137:9</a>, where dashing enemies is pictured as retributive justice. Here, Judah becomes the instrument of that justice against Edom&#8217;s long-standing hostility (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14&#8211;21</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; The text does not commend cruelty as a virtue; it narrates a specific historical judgment within God&#8217;s larger redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that all were dashed to pieces</b><p>&#8226; The completeness of the destruction highlights the finality of God&#8217;s sentence on Edom at this moment. Similar total judgments appear in the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-23.htm">Genesis 7:23</a>) and Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; For Israel&#8217;s readers, the outcome served as a sober reminder: obedience brings deliverance; rebellion invites ruin (<a href="/leviticus/26-7.htm">Leviticus 26:7&#8211;8</a> vs. <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>). Amaziah&#8217;s later apostasy (2 Chron 25:14&#8211;16) would prove the point in reverse.<p>&#8226; The event foreshadows ultimate divine justice when all wrongs will be righted (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11&#8211;15</a>).

By capturing 10,000 men, leading them to a cliff, and destroying them, Judah served as God&#8217;s instrument to punish entrenched rebellion. The passage underscores the Lord&#8217;s sovereign power in battle, the seriousness of sin, and the certainty that divine justice&#8212;though sometimes severe&#8212;is always righteous and purposeful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And other ten thousand left alive.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And ten thousand the sons of Judah took alive.</span> The LXX. renders well: <span class= "greekheb">??? ???? ???????? ????????? ?? ???? ?????</span><span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">And brought them unto the top of the rock.</span>--Or<span class= "bld">,</span> <span class= "ital">of Sela.</span> Sela, "the crag," was the Edomite capital, known to after ages as Petra, "the rock." The "Head of Sela" may be the name of a cliff overhanging the town. This savage massacre of prisoners is not mentioned in Kings; but it is quite credible, in view of the well-known atrocities of ancient warfare.

It is, however, remarkable that the chronicler does not mention the capture of Sela itself.
