In the context of ancient Israel, the law given through Moses emphasized the importance of justice and reconciliation among neighbors (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). The concept of sinning against a neighbor includes a wide range of offenses, from theft to false witness, and reflects the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor as oneself. This principle is reiterated by Jesus in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<p><b>and is required to take an oath</b><br>Oaths were a serious matter in ancient Israelite society, serving as a means to affirm truthfulness and resolve disputes. The requirement to take an oath indicates a formal legal process, often involving a public declaration of innocence or guilt. The gravity of oaths is underscored in passages like <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, where the importance of keeping one's word is emphasized. Oaths were not to be taken lightly, as they invoked the name of God as a witness to the truth.<p><b>and he comes to take an oath before Your altar</b><br>The altar in the temple was a sacred place where sacrifices and offerings were made to God. Coming before the altar to take an oath signifies seeking divine witness and judgment in the matter. The altar represents God's presence and authority, and approaching it for an oath underscores the seriousness of the situation. This practice reflects the belief that God is the ultimate judge and arbiter of truth, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-13</a>, where difficult cases are brought before the Lord.<p><b>in this temple</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship for the Israelites and symbolized God's dwelling among His people. Solomon's temple, where this scene is set, was a magnificent structure that represented the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The temple's role as a place of justice and reconciliation is highlighted in this context, as it serves as the venue for resolving disputes and seeking God's guidance. The temple's significance is further explored in passages like <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>, where Solomon acknowledges God's presence and the temple's role in the life of the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering a prayer of dedication for the newly built temple in Jerusalem.

Wronging a neighbor is not merely social failure&#8212;it is sin (<a href="/exodus/22-9.htm">Exodus 22:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently joins love for God with love for neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>). Violation of either is rebellion against the Lord&#8217;s moral order.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s prayer assumes the possibility of conflict even within the covenant community, echoing David&#8217;s confession that &#8220;against You, You only, have I sinned&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>). Horizontal offenses ultimately have vertical implications.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and is required to take an oath</b><p>&#8226; In Israel, civil disputes could reach a point where an oath before God settled the matter (<a href="/exodus/22-10.htm">Exodus 22:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; An oath called the accused into God&#8217;s immediate presence, turning the issue from &#8220;my word against yours&#8221; to &#8220;my word before the Judge of all the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later underscores the seriousness of oath-taking, calling for truthfulness so radical that oaths become unnecessary (<a href="/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34&#8211;37</a>), but the principle remains: God hears every pledge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Before Your altar&#8221; places the whole event in a worship context.

Solomon asks the Lord to act as righteous arbiter, &#8220;condemning the wicked, bringing his conduct on his own head, and vindicating the righteous&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-23.htm">2 Chronicles 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates Christ, who is both true Temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19&#8211;21</a>) and flawless Witness (<a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>); all accountability ultimately converges on Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/6-22.htm">2 Chronicles 6:22</a> recognizes that sin against a neighbor wounds community and offends God. By requiring an oath at the altar, Scripture highlights divine oversight, the gravity of truth, and the availability of mercy through sacrifice. Solomon&#8217;s petition calls God to judge with perfect justice, foreshadowing the final reckoning before Christ, where every wrong will be exposed and every right upheld.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">If a man sin.</span>--Kings, "whatever a man sin."<p><span class= "bld">And an oath be laid upon him.</span>--<span class= "ital">And he </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> his neighbour or, indefinitely, <span class= "ital">people</span>)<span class= "ital"> lay an oath upon him.</span> (See <a href="/exodus/22-11.htm" title="Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he has not put his hand to his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.">Exodus 22:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And the oath come before thine altar.</span>--<span class= "ital">And he</span> (the offender) <span class= "ital">enter upon an oath before thine altar.</span> (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm" title="And has taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath of him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:">Ezekiel 17:13</a>.)
