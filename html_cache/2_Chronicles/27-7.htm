His reign is noted for his faithfulness to God, unlike some of his predecessors and successors. The phrase suggests that there were additional deeds and accomplishments of Jotham not detailed in this particular account, indicating a fuller narrative elsewhere. This reflects the common biblical practice of summarizing a king's reign while pointing to other sources for more comprehensive details.<p><b>along with all his wars and his ways</b><br>Jotham's reign was marked by military campaigns and construction projects, including fortifying cities and building towers. His military actions were significant in maintaining the security and stability of Judah during his time. The mention of "his ways" implies his governance style and personal conduct, which were generally seen as righteous and in accordance with God's laws, as he did not follow in the sinful ways of his father Uzziah.<p><b>they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah</b><br>This reference points to a historical record that chronicled the reigns of the kings of both Israel and Judah. While this specific book is not part of the current biblical canon, it suggests that there were other historical documents used as sources for the biblical narrative. This practice of referencing other works underscores the historical nature of the biblical accounts and the importance of written records in ancient times.

Scripture often offers snapshots rather than exhaustive biographies. Compare this phrase with <a href="/2_kings/15-36.htm">2 Kings 15:36-37</a>, where the same wording appears. By repeating it, the chronicler assures us that Jotham&#8217;s life was full, purposeful, and worthy of further notice, even if every detail is not preserved in Chronicles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with all his wars</b><p>Though Chronicles records only one clear military success (defeating the Ammonites, <a href="/2_chronicles/27-5.htm">2 Chronicles 27:5</a>), this clause reminds us that conflicts were a regular part of his twelve-year reign. <a href="/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a> hints at looming Assyrian pressure and local skirmishes. The line underscores that Jotham&#8217;s faithfulness did not exempt him from warfare; rather, the Lord &#8220;made him mighty&#8221; because he ordered his ways before God (27:6). Like David in <a href="/psalms/144-1.htm">Psalm 144:1</a>, Jotham learned that God trains the hands for battle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his ways</b><p>&#8220;Ways&#8221; points to moral and spiritual conduct. Chronicles has already commended him: &#8220;He did what was right in the sight of the Lord&#8221; (27:2). His &#8220;ways&#8221; included:<p>&#8226; Refusing the pride that trapped his father Uzziah (27:2; cf. 26:16).<p>&#8226; Strengthening Judah&#8217;s defenses (27:3-4), showing stewardship.<p>&#8226; Persisting in personal devotion&#8212;he &#8220;ordered his ways before the Lord his God&#8221; (27:6).<p><a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a> urges us to &#8220;acknowledge Him in all your ways,&#8221; and Jotham&#8217;s consistent obedience illustrates that principle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah</b><p>The chronicler directs readers to another inspired record&#8212;our canonical Books of Kings&#8212;for fuller information. Similar notices appear in <a href="/1_kings/14-29.htm">1 Kings 14:29</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-34.htm">2 Chronicles 20:34</a>, revealing an established practice of keeping royal annals.

His life included unrecorded acts, real battles, and faithful habits, all documented elsewhere in Scripture. The verse encourages us to value every part of God&#8217;s Word, recognizing that He has given us precisely what we need: enough to see Jotham&#8217;s faithfulness, enough to seek further details in Kings, and enough to be stirred to order our own ways before the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And all his wars, and his ways.</span>--See <a href="/2_kings/15-36.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?">2Kings 15:36</a>, "And all that he did."
