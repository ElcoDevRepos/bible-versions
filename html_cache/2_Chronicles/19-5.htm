The appointment of judges reflects a commitment to justice and order, aligning with the biblical principle of governance found in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>, where God commands the appointment of judges and officials in every town. This action underscores the importance of righteous judgment and the rule of law in maintaining societal stability. It also highlights the king's role as a leader who seeks to uphold God's standards of justice.<p><b>in each of the fortified cities of Judah</b><br>The mention of "fortified cities" suggests a strategic and comprehensive approach to governance. Fortified cities were crucial for defense and administration, often serving as regional centers of power. By appointing judges in these locations, Jehoshaphat ensured that justice was accessible throughout the kingdom, not just in the capital. This reflects a decentralized system of governance, which can be seen as a precursor to modern judicial systems. The focus on Judah, the southern kingdom, emphasizes the historical context of the divided monarchy after the reign of Solomon, with Judah being the territory over which Jehoshaphat ruled. This action also aligns with the biblical theme of justice being a foundational aspect of God's kingdom, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a> and <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated reforms to bring the nation back to the worship of Yahweh.

Jehoshaphat proceeds from direct religious reforms to that which is of importance only second in the life of a nation - reform in the matter of civil administration of justice. The skeleton here given of what should be the character of a <span class="accented">judge</span>, and why, harmonizes well with the uniform stress laid in Scripture upon "justice and judgment." It is hard indeed to see, rather impossible, upon what foundation a sure structure of civil growth and stability can be laid, except on that of positive religion. Note the positions and the succinct arguments of vers. 6, 7; and how unequivocally they are based upon faith in a personal God, and upon his revealed character. It can scarcely be that this was the first time of judges being set in the cities of Judah but possibly the meaning intended to be conveyed with emphasis is, that now, looking well round his kingdom, he took care that all the cities should be properly provided with the necessary judges, while of late some had been, and some had not, and some, though they had been officered with judges, had found them not what judges ought to be. The immense majority of the "six thousand" Levite "officers and judges" of David's regulation (1 Chronicles 23:4; 36:29) had, with their superiors, kings and prophets, gone astray. With our present passage may be compared <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where the original enactment of judges and officers is narrated. <span class="accented">Fenced cities</span>.

The word occurs twenty-six times from the Book of Numbers to the Book of the Prophet Zechariah, and is rendered in the Authorized Version "fenced" or "defenced" twenty-two times, "walled" twice, "strong" once, and "mighty" once. The "gates" of the original institution in Deuteronomy are now (probably still the gates of) <span class="accented">fenced cities.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He appointed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1461;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
