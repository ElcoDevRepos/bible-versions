The household of Zadok refers to the priestly line established during the reign of King David, which continued through Solomon's temple. This lineage was known for its faithfulness and adherence to God's commands, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>, where the sons of Zadok are commended for their loyalty. Azariah's response indicates his authority and responsibility in managing the temple's resources and offerings.<p><b>&#8220;Since the people began to bring their contributions into the house of the LORD</b><br>This phrase highlights the revival of religious practices under King Hezekiah, who initiated reforms to restore proper worship in Judah. The contributions refer to tithes and offerings brought by the people, as commanded in the Law of Moses (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a>). The house of the LORD, or the temple in Jerusalem, was the central place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This act of bringing contributions signifies a renewed commitment to covenantal faithfulness.<p><b>we have had enough to eat, and there is plenty left over</b><br>The abundance of provisions reflects God's blessing upon the people for their obedience and generosity. This echoes the principle found in <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>, where God promises to pour out blessings when His people bring the full tithe into the storehouse. The surplus indicates not only material prosperity but also spiritual health, as the community aligns itself with God's will.<p><b>because the LORD has blessed His people</b><br>This statement attributes the abundance directly to divine favor. In the Old Testament, blessings were often seen as a sign of God's approval and presence, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>, where obedience leads to blessings. The LORD's blessing here underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where faithfulness results in tangible expressions of His provision and care.<p><b>this great abundance is what is left over.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of "great abundance" emphasizes the extent of God's provision, surpassing immediate needs and ensuring future security. This surplus can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides abundantly for His people, as illustrated in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/john/6.htm">John 6:1-14</a>), where there were twelve baskets of leftovers. The abundance serves as a testament to God's generosity and faithfulness, encouraging continued trust and reliance on Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah_the_chief_priest.htm">Azariah the Chief Priest</a></b><br>A leading religious figure from the house of Zadok, responsible for overseeing the temple activities and ensuring the proper worship of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_zadok.htm">House of Zadok</a></b><br>A priestly lineage known for their faithfulness and service in the temple, tracing back to Zadok, a high priest during the reign of King David and Solomon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/contributions_to_the_house_of_the_lord.htm">Contributions to the House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the tithes and offerings brought by the people of Judah to support the temple and its services.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The community of Israelites who responded to King Hezekiah's reforms by bringing their tithes and offerings to the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessing_of_the_lord.htm">The Blessing of the LORD</a></b><br>The divine favor and provision experienced by the people as a result of their obedience and generosity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_generosity.htm">The Principle of Generosity</a></b><br>Generosity towards God and His work results in blessings and abundance.
