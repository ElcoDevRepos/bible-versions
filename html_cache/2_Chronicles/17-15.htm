The positioning "next to him" implies a close association or support role, highlighting the importance of unity and cooperation among the leaders. This structure reflects the broader biblical theme of order and leadership, as seen in other military accounts such as those in <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>, where the Israelite camp is organized by tribes and leaders.<p><b>Jehohanan the commander</b><br>Jehohanan, meaning "Yahweh is gracious," is a name that appears several times in the Old Testament, indicating its commonality and the cultural significance of names reflecting divine attributes. As a commander, Jehohanan held a significant position of authority and responsibility, likely overseeing a division of the army. This role is comparable to other military leaders in Israel's history, such as Joshua, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/1.htm">Joshua 1:1-9</a>). The mention of Jehohanan underscores the importance of strong, godly leadership in achieving military and spiritual victories.<p><b>and with him 280,000</b><br>The specific number of 280,000 soldiers suggests a large and formidable force, indicative of Judah's military strength during King Jehoshaphat's reign. This substantial number reflects the prosperity and stability of the kingdom at the time, as well as the king's commitment to national defense. The emphasis on numerical strength is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in the census of the fighting men in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>. However, the Bible also teaches that true victory comes from reliance on God rather than sheer numbers, as demonstrated in the story of Gideon in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>, where God reduces Gideon's army to ensure that the victory is attributed to divine intervention rather than human might.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his reforms and efforts to strengthen the kingdom spiritually and militarily.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehohanan.htm">Jehohanan</a></b><br>A military commander under King Jehoshaphat, responsible for leading a significant portion of the army.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jehoshaphat reigned and sought to fortify against external threats.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/military_organization.htm">Military Organization</a></b><br>The context of this verse is the organization and strengthening of Judah's military forces under Jehoshaphat's leadership.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>Jehohanan's role as a commander highlights the importance of leadership and responsibility in God's work.

The wording shows an orderly arrangement&#8212;each leader stood &#8220;next&#8221; to another, forming a unified chain of command (compare <a href="/nehemiah/3-4.htm">Nehemiah 3:4&#8211;5</a>, where &#8220;next to them&#8221; highlights cooperative service).<p>&#8226; By placing leaders side-by-side, Scripture emphasizes corporate strength within Judah&#8217;s army as well as mutual accountability (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The orderly sequence also reflects God&#8217;s own character of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>) and reminds us that effective ministry often flourishes when believers serve shoulder-to-shoulder (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jehohanan the commander</b><p>&#8226; Jehohanan is presented as a &#8220;commander&#8221;. The Hebrew title elsewhere denotes a chief officer, underscoring both authority and responsibility (<a href="/2_samuel/23-19.htm">2 Samuel 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; His name, meaning &#8220;Yahweh has been gracious,&#8221; quietly echoes the truth that leadership in God&#8217;s kingdom is a gracious gift, not personal entitlement (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The chronicler often highlights faithful leaders to demonstrate how God supplies capable servants for His people (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-11.htm">2 Chronicles 19:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-12.htm">2 Chronicles 31:12-13</a>). Jehohanan&#8217;s placement among other notable officers shows that God raised multiple competent men under Jehoshaphat, fulfilling the king&#8217;s earlier resolve &#8220;to seek the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-4.htm">2 Chronicles 17:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross-reference <a href="/1_chronicles/12-4.htm">1 Chronicles 12:4, 12</a>:13, where men named Jehohanan stand among David&#8217;s warriors&#8212;reinforcing the idea that God consistently provides strong leadership throughout Israel&#8217;s history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and with him 280,000</b><p>&#8226; The number is literal, testifying to the substantial military resources God granted Judah at this time (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14</a> specifies 300,000 under Adnah; 17:16 lists 200,000 under Amasiah).<p>&#8226; Such large forces fulfill God&#8217;s promise to bless obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>). Jehoshaphat sought the Lord, and the result was security and strength (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The chronicler contrasts these robust numbers with earlier periods of moral failure that led to military weakness (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1-3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The figure also illustrates that spiritual fidelity does not negate practical preparedness. Just as Asa fielded &#8220;300,000 from Judah&#8221; while relying on the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8-11</a>), Jehoshaphat&#8217;s army exemplifies a balanced trust&#8212;faith in God and diligent readiness (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s blessing can be measured in tangible ways, yet the chronicler never lets numbers eclipse reliance on the Lord (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/17-15.htm">2 Chronicles 17:15</a> nestles within a catalog of commanders to spotlight an ordered, well-supplied army under Jehoshaphat. The phrase &#8220;next to him&#8221; affirms structured teamwork; &#8220;Jehohanan the commander&#8221; highlights God-given, responsible leadership; and &#8220;with him 280,000&#8221; displays the concrete blessing that flows from a nation and king who seek the Lord. Together the details call believers to value orderly cooperation, honor godly leaders, and recognize that faithful obedience invites both spiritual and practical strength from God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Next to him.</span>--<span class= "ital">At his hand, i.e.,</span> beside him, and subordinate to him.
