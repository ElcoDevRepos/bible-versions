This act of concealment was crucial for preserving the Davidic line, which was under threat from Athaliah's usurpation. The protection of Joash can be seen as a divine intervention to ensure the continuation of God's covenant with David, as promised in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. This concealment also parallels the protection of Moses as a child, hidden from Pharaoh's decree, highlighting God's providential care in preserving His chosen leaders.<p><b>in the house of God</b><br>The house of God refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place of worship and the center of religious life in Judah. The temple served as a sanctuary, not only spiritually but physically, for Joash. This location underscores the theme of God's presence and protection, as the temple was where God dwelled among His people. The temple's role as a place of refuge is significant, as it symbolizes God's safeguarding of His promises and His people. The temple's sanctity provided a secure environment for Joash, away from Athaliah's reach.<p><b>for six years</b><br>The six-year period during which Joash was hidden is significant, as it represents a time of waiting and preparation. Biblically, the number six often symbolizes incompleteness or human effort, contrasting with the divine completion symbolized by the number seven. This period allowed for Joash to be nurtured and prepared for his future role as king. It also reflects a time of testing and endurance for the faithful remnant in Judah, who awaited the restoration of the Davidic line.<p><b>while Athaliah ruled the land</b><br>Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, ruled Judah with a tyrannical grip, having seized power after the death of her son Ahaziah. Her reign is marked by idolatry and the attempt to eradicate the Davidic line, which she saw as a threat to her authority. Athaliah's rule represents a period of spiritual and moral decline in Judah, as she introduced Baal worship and led the nation away from the worship of Yahweh. Her usurpation is a stark contrast to the rightful kingship of Joash, highlighting the conflict between the forces of evil and God's sovereign plan. This period of Athaliah's rule also serves as a backdrop for the eventual restoration and renewal under Joash, foreshadowing the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The young king of Judah who was hidden in the temple for six years to protect him from Athaliah's murderous intent.
