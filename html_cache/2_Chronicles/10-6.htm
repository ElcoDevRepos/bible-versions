The act of consulting with elders was a common practice in ancient Israel, as elders were respected for their wisdom and experience. This consultation reflects a traditional approach to leadership, where seeking counsel from those with experience was valued. The elders had served under Solomon, who was renowned for his wisdom, suggesting they were well-versed in governance and the complexities of ruling a nation.<p><b>who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime.</b><br>These elders had firsthand experience with Solomon's reign, which was marked by prosperity and peace, largely due to Solomon's wisdom and the blessings of God. Their service under Solomon implies they were familiar with the policies and decisions that contributed to the kingdom's success. This historical context highlights the potential for continuity in leadership and policy, as these elders could provide insights based on Solomon's effective governance.<p><b>&#8220;How do you advise me to respond to these people?&#8221; he asked.</b><br>Rehoboam's question pertains to the request from the Israelites to lighten the heavy burden of labor and taxes imposed by Solomon. This moment is critical, as it reflects a pivotal decision point for Rehoboam's reign. The request from the people indicates a growing discontent that could lead to division. The elders' advice would be crucial in determining whether Rehoboam would maintain unity in the kingdom or face rebellion. This scenario echoes the biblical theme of wise counsel, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which states, "Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.
