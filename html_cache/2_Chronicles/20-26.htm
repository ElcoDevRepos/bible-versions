In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>, this refers to the aftermath of a miraculous victory granted by God to Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah over a coalition of enemies. The number four in biblical numerology often symbolizes completeness or universality, suggesting the fulfillment of God's promise and the completeness of their victory.<p><b>they assembled in the Valley of Beracah</b><br>The Valley of Beracah, meaning "Valley of Blessing," is a geographical location where the people of Judah gathered to praise God. This valley is believed to be located near Tekoa, south of Jerusalem. The assembly in this valley highlights the communal aspect of worship and thanksgiving, emphasizing the importance of coming together to acknowledge God's intervention and blessings. The gathering also reflects the cultural practice of marking significant events with communal worship and celebration.<p><b>where they blessed the LORD</b><br>Blessing the LORD in this context involves offering praise and thanksgiving for His deliverance and provision. This act of worship is a response to God's faithfulness and power, acknowledging His sovereignty and goodness. The concept of blessing God is rooted in the Hebrew tradition of recognizing God's hand in the affairs of His people, as seen throughout the Psalms and other Old Testament scriptures. It underscores the reciprocal relationship between God and His people, where divine intervention is met with human gratitude.<p><b>Therefore that place is called the Valley of Beracah to this day</b><br>The naming of the valley serves as a lasting memorial to God's deliverance and the people's gratitude. Such naming practices are common in the Old Testament, where significant events are commemorated by naming places, as seen with Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>) and Gilgal (<a href="/joshua/4-20.htm">Joshua 4:20</a>). This enduring name serves as a testimony to future generations of God's faithfulness and the importance of remembering His acts. It also reflects the cultural practice of using place names to convey historical and spiritual truths, ensuring that the story of God's deliverance is preserved and retold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the people in seeking the Lord's guidance and deliverance from their enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley_of_beracah.htm">The Valley of Beracah</a></b><br>The location where the people of Judah gathered to bless the Lord after their victory.
