The Arameans, also known as Syrians, were a significant power in the region, but their army was notably small in this instance. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God uses seemingly weak or small forces to accomplish His purposes, as seen in Gideon's victory over the Midianites (Judges 7). The Arameans' success despite their small numbers underscores the divine intervention in the battle, emphasizing that victory does not depend on human strength or numbers but on God's will.<p><b>the LORD delivered into their hand a very great army</b><br>The phrase indicates that the defeat of Judah was not due to the military prowess of the Arameans but was orchestrated by the LORD. This reflects the biblical principle that God is sovereign over the nations and can use them as instruments of His judgment. The "very great army" refers to the forces of Judah, which were substantial but ultimately powerless against God's decree. This event serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God, as seen in other instances where God allows foreign nations to triumph over Israel or Judah as a form of punishment (e.g., Babylonian captivity).<p><b>Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers</b><br>This phrase provides the reason for Judah's defeat: their abandonment of the covenant with God. The phrase "the God of their fathers" emphasizes the historical and covenantal relationship between God and the people of Judah, tracing back to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Forsaking the LORD often involved idolatry and moral decay, which were prevalent during the reign of King Joash after the death of Jehoiada the priest. This apostasy is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the people's unfaithfulness leads to divine judgment.<p><b>judgment was executed on Joash</b><br>Joash, the king of Judah, initially followed God under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest but later turned away, leading to his downfall. The execution of judgment on Joash is a fulfillment of the prophetic warnings given to the kings and people of Judah. This judgment serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of turning away from God and the inevitable consequences of such actions. Joash's story parallels other biblical accounts where leaders who forsake God face dire outcomes, reinforcing the importance of faithfulness and obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (King of Judah)</a></b><br>Initially a righteous king who later turned away from God, leading to his downfall.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aramean_army.htm">Aramean Army</a></b><br>A small force that God used to execute judgment on Judah for their unfaithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which had forsaken God, leading to their defeat.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who allowed the Arameans to defeat Judah as a form of judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_on_joash.htm">Judgment on Joash</a></b><br>The consequence of Joash's apostasy and the nation's unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_forsaking_god.htm">The Consequences of Forsaking God</a></b><br>When a nation or individual turns away from God, they open themselves to judgment and defeat.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God can use even a small force to accomplish His purposes, demonstrating His control over all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faithfulness.htm">The Importance of Faithfulness</a></b><br>Remaining faithful to God is crucial for His continued blessing and protection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_accountability.htm">Leadership and Accountability</a></b><br>Leaders are held accountable for their actions, and their choices can have significant consequences for those they lead.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>While judgment is severe, God always offers a path to repentance and restoration for those who turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_24_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 24:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_24_24_shows_God_s_control_in_war.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 24:24 illustrate God's sovereignty over Israel's military outcomes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_obedience_from_2_Chr_24_24.htm">What lessons about obedience to God can we learn from 2 Chronicles 24:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_2_Chr_24_24_to_Deut_covenants.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 24:24 connect with God's covenant promises in Deuteronomy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_divine_justice_today_5.htm">In what ways can we apply the principle of divine justice today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_24_24_Trust_God_not_human_might.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 24:24 encourage reliance on God rather than human strength?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_was_Judah_defeated_in_2_Chron_24_24.htm">Why did the LORD allow Judah to be defeated despite their covenant with Him in 2 Chronicles 24:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_24_24_on_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 24:24 reflect on God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_24_24_Consequences_of_forsaking_God.htm">What does 2 Chronicles 24:24 teach about the consequences of abandoning God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_did_a_small_aramean_force_beat_judah.htm">How could a small Aramean force defeat Judah&#8217;s army (2 Chronicles 24:24) if military records and common sense suggest larger forces usually prevail?

After the death of Jehoiada the priest, King Joash listened to officials who lured him into idolatry (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-19</a>). Forsaking the Lord included:<p>&#8211; Abandoning temple worship and turning to Asherah poles and idols.<p>&#8211; Rejecting prophetic warnings (v. 19; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/7-19.htm">2 Chronicles 7:19-20</a>).<p>&#8211; Silencing truth by murdering Zechariah, Jehoiada&#8217;s son (v. 21; <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>).<p>Such apostasy violates the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and inevitably invites discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).
