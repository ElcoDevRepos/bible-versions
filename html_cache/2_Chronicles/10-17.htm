His reign marks a significant turning point in Israel's history, as it led to the division of the united kingdom. Despite the rebellion of the northern tribes, Rehoboam retained control over the southern kingdom. This phrase highlights the continuation of Davidic rule in Judah, fulfilling God's promise to David that his descendants would remain on the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). Rehoboam's reign is a reminder of the enduring nature of God's covenants, even amidst human failure and division.<p><b>over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.</b><br>The term "Israelites" here refers to the people of the southern kingdom, Judah, which included the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The cities of Judah were the heartland of the Davidic dynasty, with Jerusalem as its capital. This region was historically significant, as it housed the Temple, the center of Jewish worship. The division of the kingdom into Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom) was a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). This division also set the stage for future conflicts and the eventual Babylonian exile.

God had pledged an enduring dynasty to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), and Rehoboam embodies that promise even as the kingdom fractures. His very presence on the throne underscores:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness to covenant promises despite human failure.<p>&#8226; The continuity of David&#8217;s line, which ultimately culminates in Christ (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>still reigned</b><p>The words &#8220;still reigned&#8221; reveal a surprising stability in the midst of chaos (<a href="/1_kings/12-17.htm">1 Kings 12:17</a>). Ten tribes have just broken away, yet Rehoboam retains legitimate authority:<p>&#8226; His reign is no accidental holdover; it is divinely allowed (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s prior warning through Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-33</a>) is fulfilled; judgment falls, but the royal line is preserved.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereign hand limits the fallout.

God said that this tribe and (as is abundantly evident from Ahijah's forcibly dramatic parable of the rent garment) Benjamin also should be saved to Rehoboam and for ever to David's line, and again it is evident that he works in the midst of human event, and moral cause and effect. Israel would not have revolted but that Jeroboam was of Ephraim, and Judah would not have remained steadfast but that, with other determining influences also, to Judah belonged Rehoboam and Solomon and David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/10-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but Rehoboam</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#7717;a&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7346.htm">Strong's 7346: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rehoboam -- 'a people are enlarged', a king of Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">still reigned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yim&#183;l&#333;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
