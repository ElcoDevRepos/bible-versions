It demonstrates his humility and recognition of the need for divine guidance. The act of inquiring of the LORD was a common practice in ancient Israel, often involving prophets or priests. Josiah's concern for both Israel and Judah indicates his awareness of the divided kingdom's history and his desire for unity and spiritual renewal. This inquiry is reminiscent of other biblical figures seeking God's will, such as David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>) and Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-6.htm">2 Chronicles 18:6</a>).<p><b>concerning the words in the book that has been found</b><br>The "book" refers to the Book of the Law, likely Deuteronomy, discovered during temple repairs. This discovery is significant, as it suggests that the Law had been neglected or lost during previous reigns, particularly under Manasseh and Amon. The rediscovery highlights the importance of Scripture in guiding the nation and underscores the need for reform. The finding of the book parallels the rediscovery of God's Word in personal and communal revivals throughout history.<p><b>For great is the wrath of the LORD that has been poured out on us</b><br>Josiah acknowledges the severity of God's anger due to the nation's disobedience. The phrase "poured out" suggests an overwhelming and consuming judgment, similar to imagery used in the prophets (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>). This wrath is a consequence of covenant unfaithfulness, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are contingent on Israel's obedience. The historical context includes the Assyrian threat and the earlier fall of the northern kingdom, serving as tangible reminders of divine judgment.<p><b>because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD</b><br>This admission of ancestral failure highlights the generational impact of sin and disobedience. It reflects the biblical principle of corporate responsibility, where the actions of one generation affect subsequent ones (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Josiah's recognition of past failures is a step towards repentance and reform. This acknowledgment is crucial for understanding the need for national repentance and aligns with the prophetic calls for returning to the LORD (e.g., <a href="/hosea/14.htm">Hosea 14:1</a>).<p><b>by doing all that is written in this book</b><br>The emphasis on "doing" underscores the biblical theme that true faith is demonstrated through obedience (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). The Law was not merely to be read or heard but acted upon. This call to action is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Josiah's reform efforts, including the removal of idolatry and the reinstitution of Passover, are practical applications of this principle. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on living out the teachings of Christ (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh.
