The context is a civil war between the divided kingdoms of Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom). Abijah's victory is attributed to his reliance on the LORD, as he had previously addressed the Israelites, reminding them of their covenant with God and the legitimacy of David's line (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-12</a>). This victory underscores the theme of divine support for those who remain faithful to God's covenant. The "mighty blow" signifies not just a physical triumph but also a spiritual one, as it demonstrates God's favor towards Judah at this time.<p><b>and 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain</b><br>The staggering number of casualties reflects the scale and intensity of the conflict. This figure, while possibly hyperbolic, emphasizes the severity of the defeat for Israel and serves as a warning against turning away from God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, large numbers in battle accounts often symbolized total victory or defeat. The term "chosen men" indicates that these were elite troops, suggesting that Israel's military strength was significant, yet insufficient against Judah's divinely aided forces. This event can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given to Israel about the consequences of idolatry and rebellion against God's commandments, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.

Compare <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6 and 2</a> Chron 14:11, where reliance on the LORD, not numbers, decides battles.<p>&#8226; This opening phrase stresses corporate obedience; &#8220;his people&#8221; stood with their king in trusting the LORD (2 Chron 13:10). Unity under God brings strength (cf. <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Struck them with a mighty blow</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;struck them with a mighty blow&#8230;&#8221; (v. 17)<p>&#8226; The text attributes victory directly to Judah&#8217;s strike, yet verse 15 clarifies the LORD &#8220;routed Jeroboam and all Israel.&#8221; God acts through His people (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Mighty blow&#8221; underscores decisive judgment when a nation opposes God&#8217;s rule (1 Chron 5:22).<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: Israel relies on golden calves and human strategy (2 Chron 13:8-9); Judah relies on the covenant God. The result matches <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;the LORD your God is the One who goes with you&#8230;to give you victory.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain.&#8221; (v. 17)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Chosen&#8221; soldiers&#8212;hand-picked elite&#8212;could not stand against God&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The staggering number signals both historical reality and theological warning. Similar large losses mark pivotal moments of judgment (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>; 2 Chron 28:6).<p>&#8226; Jeroboam&#8217;s breakaway kingdom now pays for idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>). The defeat leaves Israel crippled (2 Chron 13:20) and confirms the curse for covenant breach (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Lessons:<p>&#8211; Turning from God invites severe consequences, no matter one&#8217;s resources.<p>&#8211; Obedience positions God&#8217;s people to experience His power.<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s faithfulness includes both protection for the obedient and discipline for the wayward (<a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/13-17.htm">2 Chronicles 13:17</a> records more than military statistics; it reveals the Lord&#8217;s unwavering commitment to defend those who honor Him and to judge those who rebel. Abijah&#8217;s reliance on the covenant God brings miraculous victory, while Israel&#8217;s trust in idols leads to catastrophic loss. The verse challenges us to side with God in faith and obedience, confident that His power, not human strength, determines the outcome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Slew them with a great slaughter.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Smote in them a great smiting.</span> <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm" title="And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.">Numbers 11:33</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Five hundred thousand chosen men.</span>--Or more than half of Jeroboam's entire army.<p>It is hardly true to say that "there is nothing in the original to indicate that this slaughter was all on one day."
