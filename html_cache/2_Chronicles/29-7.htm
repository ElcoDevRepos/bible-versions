The portico, or porch, was an important part of the temple structure, serving as a transitional space between the outer courts and the inner sanctum. Shutting its doors indicates a cessation of temple activities and a disregard for the covenant relationship with God. This act reflects the spiritual decline during the reign of King Ahaz, who led Judah into idolatry and away from the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>and extinguished the lamps.</b><br>The lamps in the temple were meant to burn continually as a symbol of God's eternal presence and guidance (<a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20-21</a>). Extinguishing them signifies a departure from divine light and truth, paralleling the spiritual darkness that had fallen over Judah. This neglect of the lamps is a direct violation of the priestly duties outlined in the Law of Moses, highlighting the people's disobedience and the need for reform.<p><b>They did not burn incense</b><br>Burning incense was a daily ritual in the temple, representing the prayers of the people ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). The absence of this practice indicates a breakdown in communication with God and a failure to seek His favor and guidance. This neglect is emblematic of the broader spiritual apathy and rebellion against God's commands.<p><b>or present burnt offerings</b><br>Burnt offerings were central to the sacrificial system, symbolizing atonement for sin and dedication to God (Leviticus 1). The failure to present these offerings reflects a disregard for the need for repentance and reconciliation with God. It underscores the people's estrangement from the covenant and their need for spiritual renewal.<p><b>in the Holy Place of the God of Israel.</b><br>The Holy Place was a sacred area within the temple where priests performed their duties, including the burning of incense and the maintenance of the lamps. It was a space set apart for worship and service to God. The neglect of these practices in the Holy Place signifies a profound disrespect for the sanctity of God's dwelling and a breach of the covenant relationship.

Closing those doors:<p>&#8226; Stopped every prescribed act of worship that required access to the sanctuary.<p>&#8226; Signaled rebellion, much like when King Jehoiakim mutilated Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23-24</a>)&#8212;a deliberate rejection rather than accidental neglect.<p>&#8226; Left the people without the visible reminder that God welcomed them (<a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>).

Hezekiah&#8217;s later revival hurried to restore these offerings (2 Chron 29:21-27), prefiguring the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a> records four deliberate acts&#8212;shutting the doors, extinguishing the lamps, halting incense, and stopping burnt offerings&#8212;that together picture a full shutdown of God-ordained worship. Each action physically blocked a specific means by which the Lord had chosen to reveal Himself and receive His people. The verse warns that turning from God begins with small closures and ends in complete darkness, yet it sets the stage for Hezekiah&#8217;s bright restoration and ultimately for Christ, who opens the way, keeps the light burning, intercedes continually, and offers the perfect sacrifice forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">The porch.</span>--Of the holy place, or nave of the Temple; the only entrance to the two holy chambers.<p><span class= "bld">Put out the lamps.</span>--Of the great golden stand, in the holy place.<p><span class= "bld">Have not burned incense.</span>--On the golden altar.
