His actions were comprehensive, affecting the entire kingdom of Judah. This phrase highlights the extent of his reforms, which included the destruction of idolatrous altars and the restoration of the temple. Historically, Hezekiah's reign is marked by a return to the worship practices outlined in the Mosaic Law, emphasizing the centralization of worship in Jerusalem. This aligns with the Deuteronomic reform principles, which sought to eliminate high places and local shrines in favor of a single place of worship.<p><b>He did what was good and upright and true before the LORD his God.</b><br>Hezekiah's actions are described with three key attributes: good, upright, and true. These qualities reflect the biblical standards of righteousness and faithfulness to God's commandments. The phrase underscores Hezekiah's personal devotion and integrity in his relationship with God. In the context of the Old Testament, doing what is "good" often refers to actions that align with God's will, "upright" suggests moral integrity, and "true" indicates faithfulness and sincerity. This description of Hezekiah can be compared to other biblical figures like David, who also sought to lead with a heart aligned with God's purposes. The emphasis on these virtues highlights the importance of internal character in leadership, not just external actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who reigned during a time of significant religious reform.
