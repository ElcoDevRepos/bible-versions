He was appointed by Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon, after the deposition of his nephew Jehoiachin. His young age at ascension reflects the turbulent times and the lack of stable leadership in Judah. The name change from Mattaniah to Zedekiah, meaning "The Lord is my righteousness," was likely intended to signify a new beginning or allegiance to Babylon. This practice of renaming vassal kings was common in the ancient Near East, symbolizing control and authority over the subject.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years</b><br>Zedekiah's reign from 597 to 586 BC was marked by political instability and rebellion against Babylonian rule. Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was a significant city both politically and spiritually, housing the Temple built by Solomon. Zedekiah's reign ended with the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple, fulfilling the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel regarding Judah's downfall due to its disobedience to God. The eleven-year reign signifies a period of grace and warning before the ultimate judgment. This period is a reminder of God's patience and the consequences of ignoring prophetic warnings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who ascended to the throne at the age of twenty-one.
