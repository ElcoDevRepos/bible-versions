The chariot was a common mode of transportation for kings and military leaders in ancient times, symbolizing both status and mobility. The urgency of removing Josiah from the battlefield highlights the severity of his injuries and the loyalty of his servants. This moment reflects the chaos and desperation of the battlefield, as well as the devotion of Josiah's followers.<p><b>put him in his second chariot</b><br>The mention of a "second chariot" indicates a prepared contingency for emergencies, a common practice for kings to ensure their safety. This secondary chariot would have been less ornate and more functional, designed for speed and efficiency in transporting the wounded king away from danger. It underscores the foresight and preparedness of Josiah's administration.<p><b>and brought him to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital city and spiritual center of Judah, was the logical destination for the wounded king. It was not only the seat of political power but also the location of the Temple, the heart of Jewish worship. Bringing Josiah to Jerusalem signifies the attempt to provide him with the best possible care and to ensure that he was surrounded by his people and the religious community in his final moments.<p><b>where he died</b><br>Josiah's death marks the end of a significant era in Judah's history. He was known for his religious reforms and efforts to return Judah to the worship of Yahweh, as detailed earlier in 2 Chronicles. His death in Jerusalem, the city he sought to purify and restore, is poignant. It also fulfills the prophecy given by Huldah the prophetess in <a href="/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>, where she foretold that Josiah would die in peace, not witnessing the disaster that would come upon Judah.<p><b>And Josiah was buried in the tomb of his fathers</b><br>This burial phrase indicates that Josiah was laid to rest with honor among the previous kings of Judah. The "tomb of his fathers" suggests a royal burial site, likely in the City of David, where other kings were interred. This burial honors his legacy and connects him to the Davidic line, emphasizing his rightful place in the history of Judah's monarchy.<p><b>and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him</b><br>The mourning of "all Judah and Jerusalem" reflects the deep impact of Josiah's death on the nation. His reforms and leadership had endeared him to the people, and his loss was felt profoundly across the kingdom. This collective mourning is reminiscent of the national grief for other significant leaders in Israel's history, such as Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25:1</a>) and Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>).

Josiah&#8217;s attendants act quickly, affirming loyal service. The second chariot underscores urgency and dignity. Jerusalem becomes the setting for his final moments, fulfilling divine appointment. Burial with his fathers honors the king and vindicates God&#8217;s promise. The nation&#8217;s mourning reveals how deeply righteousness influences a people. Together, the verse reminds us that godly leaders are gifts from God, mortal like all of us, and their loss should move hearts to renewed devotion and obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">That chariot.</span>--<span class= "ital">The</span> (war) <span class= "ital">chariot.</span><p><span class= "bld">Put him.</span>--<span class= "ital">Made him ride.</span><p><span class= "bld">Brought him to Jerusalem, and he died.</span>--<a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm" title="And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher.
