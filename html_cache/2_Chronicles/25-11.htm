His reign is noted for both his initial obedience to God and later idolatry. The phrase "summoned his strength" indicates a moment of decision and resolve, suggesting a reliance on his own capabilities. This can be contrasted with biblical teachings that emphasize reliance on God&#8217;s strength (e.g., <a href="/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a>). The context here is a military campaign, and the phrase may imply both physical and moral courage.<p><b>and led his troops to the Valley of Salt</b><br>The Valley of Salt is located near the Dead Sea, a region known for its harsh, arid conditions. Historically, this area was significant for its strategic location and resources. The Valley of Salt is also mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a> and <a href="/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60:1</a>, where David achieved a notable victory. This connection to David may imply a continuation of divine favor and military success for the kings of Judah, although Amaziah's later actions would show a departure from David's faithfulness.<p><b>where he struck down 10,000 men of Seir</b><br>The men of Seir were Edomites, descendants of Esau, and often in conflict with Israel and Judah. This victory over Edom is significant as it fulfills earlier prophecies of Israel's dominance over Edom (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). The number 10,000 symbolizes a complete and overwhelming victory. This event highlights the ongoing struggle between the descendants of Jacob and Esau, reflecting the broader biblical theme of conflict between God's chosen people and their adversaries. The victory also serves as a type of Christ's ultimate triumph over sin and evil, as Christ is seen as the ultimate King who defeats His enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Joash, who reigned after his father's death.
