Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had previously installed Zedekiah as a vassal king over Judah. This rebellion was not just a political maneuver but also a breach of an oath made before God, as Zedekiah had sworn allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar by invoking God's name. This act of rebellion is seen as a direct defiance against God's established order at the time, as Nebuchadnezzar was used by God to execute judgment on Judah for their disobedience.<p><b>who had made him swear by God</b><br>The oath Zedekiah took was a solemn one, invoking the name of God, which made it binding and sacred. In the ancient Near Eastern context, oaths were serious commitments, and breaking them was considered a grave sin. This highlights the spiritual dimension of Zedekiah's rebellion, as it was not merely against a foreign king but against God Himself. The breaking of this oath is seen as a violation of the Third Commandment, which warns against taking the Lord's name in vain.<p><b>But Zedekiah stiffened his neck</b><br>The phrase "stiffened his neck" is a metaphor for stubbornness and resistance to correction. In biblical literature, this imagery is often used to describe Israel's repeated disobedience and unwillingness to submit to God's will. This stubbornness is a recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah, leading to their eventual downfall and exile. It reflects a heart that is unyielding and resistant to divine guidance.<p><b>and hardened his heart</b><br>The hardening of the heart is a spiritual condition where an individual becomes insensitive to God's voice and resistant to His commands. This phrase echoes the condition of Pharaoh's heart in the Exodus narrative, where repeated refusals to heed God's warnings led to judgment. In Zedekiah's case, it signifies a deliberate choice to ignore prophetic warnings and continue in a path of disobedience, ultimately leading to the destruction of Jerusalem.<p><b>against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel</b><br>Zedekiah's refusal to turn to the LORD indicates a rejection of repentance and a failure to seek God's mercy. Throughout the Old Testament, turning to the LORD is synonymous with repentance and seeking restoration. The prophets, including Jeremiah, repeatedly called for the kings and people of Judah to return to God, promising that He would relent from sending disaster if they repented. Zedekiah's failure to do so underscores the tragic consequences of ignoring God's call to repentance and the inevitable judgment that follows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned from 597 to 586 BC.
