However, due to the spiritual decline in Judah, the people were not prepared to celebrate it at the appointed time. This delay highlights the neglect of religious duties and the need for spiritual renewal. The provision for a second Passover in the second month, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/9-10.htm">Numbers 9:10-11</a>, allowed for those who were unclean or on a journey to still participate, demonstrating God's grace and desire for inclusion.<p><b>because not enough priests had consecrated themselves</b><br>The consecration of priests was essential for them to perform their duties, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>. The lack of consecrated priests indicates a period of spiritual laxity and neglect of the priestly responsibilities. This situation underscores the importance of holiness and preparation in serving God, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/29-34.htm">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>, where the Levites had to assist because the priests were not ready.

The failure to gather the people there for the Passover signifies a breakdown in national unity and religious observance. This gathering was not just a ritual but a communal act of worship and remembrance of God's deliverance. The call to gather in Jerusalem is reminiscent of the future gathering of God's people, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>, pointing to the eschatological hope of unity and worship in the Messianic age.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the celebration of the Passover, seeking to restore proper worship and obedience to God's commands.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The religious leaders responsible for conducting the Passover, who had not yet consecrated themselves, delaying the celebration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship where the Passover was to be celebrated, as prescribed by the Law of Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, which Hezekiah sought to reinstate.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The community called to gather in Jerusalem for the Passover, representing both the tribes of Judah and remnants of the northern kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_consecration.htm">The Importance of Consecration</a></b><br>Spiritual leaders must be prepared and consecrated to lead God's people in worship.
