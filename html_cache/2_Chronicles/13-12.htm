In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/13.htm">2 Chronicles 13</a>, Abijah, the king of Judah, is addressing Jeroboam and the northern kingdom of Israel. The assertion that God is with Judah as their head reflects the covenant relationship between God and the Davidic line, which is central to the narrative of the Chronicles. This echoes the promise made to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, where God assures David that his throne will be established forever. The concept of God as the head also prefigures Christ, who is described as the head of the Church in <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>.<p><b>and His priests with their trumpets sound the battle call against you</b><br>The mention of priests and trumpets is significant in the context of ancient Israelite warfare. According to <a href="/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8-9</a>, trumpets were used by the priests to signal the presence of God and to call the people to battle, serving as a reminder that the battle belongs to the Lord. This practice underscores the theocratic nature of Israel, where religious and military activities were intertwined. The priests' involvement highlights the spiritual dimension of the conflict, suggesting that the battle is not merely physical but also spiritual.<p><b>O children of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers</b><br>Abijah's address to the "children of Israel" serves as a reminder of their shared heritage and covenant with God. By invoking "the God of your fathers," Abijah appeals to the historical relationship between God and the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This phrase calls the northern tribes to remember their roots and the covenant promises made to their ancestors. It also serves as a warning that opposing Judah is tantamount to opposing God Himself, as seen in the broader biblical narrative where rebellion against God's chosen leaders often leads to divine judgment.<p><b>for you will not succeed.</b><br>This statement is a prophetic declaration of the futility of fighting against God's will. Throughout the Old Testament, there are numerous instances where those who oppose God's plans face defeat, such as Pharaoh in Exodus or the Canaanite kings in Joshua. The assurance of failure for those who fight against God is a recurring theme, reinforcing the idea that God's purposes will ultimately prevail. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that victory is assured for those who align themselves with God's will, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, "If God is for us, who can be against us?"<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is speaking in this verse.
