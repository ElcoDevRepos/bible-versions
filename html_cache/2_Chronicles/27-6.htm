His reign is noted for stability and strength, which is reflected in his military successes and building projects. The phrase "grew powerful" indicates not only military might but also political influence and stability. This growth in power can be seen as a continuation of the prosperity that began under his father, Uzziah, who also had a successful reign until his pride led to his downfall (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>). Jotham's power is a testament to his effective leadership and the favor of God upon his reign.<p><b>because he ordered his ways</b><br>This phrase highlights Jotham's intentional and disciplined approach to governance and personal conduct. "Ordered his ways" suggests a life of structure, purpose, and adherence to a set of principles. In the context of a king, this would involve just and wise administration, as well as personal integrity. The Hebrew concept of "ways" often refers to one's conduct or lifestyle, indicating that Jotham's actions were consistent and aligned with divine expectations.<p><b>before the LORD his God</b><br>Jotham's success is attributed to his relationship with God, emphasizing that his power was not merely due to human effort or strategy but was a result of divine blessing. The phrase "before the LORD" suggests living in a manner that is pleasing to God, with an awareness of His presence and authority. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and the kings of Judah, where obedience to God's laws was expected. Jotham's faithfulness contrasts with other kings who turned away from God, leading to their downfall. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme that true success and prosperity come from aligning one's life with God's will, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a> and <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Uzziah, who reigned for sixteen years.

His reign, unlike his father Uzziah&#8217;s troubled finish (2 Chron 26:16&#8211;21), is marked by stability and strength. Scripture often records this pattern: when a king follows the Lord, national security and personal influence increase (see 2 Chron 17:5 with Jehoshaphat; <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>). &#8220;Powerful&#8221; here embraces military success (2 Chron 27:5), civic building (v. 4), and personal reputation, much like Joseph&#8217;s favor in <a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2&#8211;4</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because</b><p>The verse explicitly links Jotham&#8217;s might to a spiritual cause. God&#8217;s promises in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1&#8211;2</a> stand behind this: obedience draws blessing. The chronicler repeatedly shows cause-and-effect between faithfulness and prosperity (2 Chron 31:21; 26:5). There is no hint of chance&#8212;Jotham&#8217;s strength is the result of divine favor responding to a godly life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he ordered his ways</b><p>&#8220;Ordered&#8221; points to deliberate, consistent choices. Jotham didn&#8217;t drift into righteousness; he set his course. Compare <a href="/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3</a>, where David urges Solomon to &#8220;keep the charge of the LORD.&#8221; Practical outworkings include:<p>&#8226; refusing the idolatrous high places his people clung to (<a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a>)<p>&#8226; administering justice in building projects (2 Chron 27:4)<p>&#8226; leading by example rather than mere decree (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-133.htm">Psalm 119:133</a>, &#8220;order my steps in Your word&#8221;).<p>Such alignment with God&#8217;s revealed standards echoes <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a> and <a href="/psalms/119-1.htm">Psalm 119:1&#8211;3</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before the LORD his God</b><p>Jotham lived coram Deo&#8212;consciously in God&#8217;s presence. This phrase underscores relationship: &#8220;his&#8221; God, not a distant deity. Earlier, his father &#8220;set himself to seek God&#8221; (2 Chron 26:5), but later lost that focus; Jotham maintained it. Walking &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; evokes Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a> and Hezekiah in <a href="/2_kings/20-3.htm">2 Kings 20:3</a>, reminding us that genuine strength flows from intimacy with God (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jotham&#8217;s story illustrates a timeless principle: steadfast obedience brings God-given strength. He arranged every aspect of life under the Lord&#8217;s authority, and the Lord rewarded him with power that blessed both king and kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">So Jotham became mighty.</span>--The chronicler's customary phrase.

(Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/12-17.htm" title="And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you: but if you be come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.">1Chronicles 12:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm" title="And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.">1Samuel 7:3</a>.) "Direct your heart towards Jehovah." Perhaps, however, "before" simply means "as in the sight of" Jehovah.
