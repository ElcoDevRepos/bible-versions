In the Old Testament, prophets often prefaced their messages with "Thus says the LORD" to indicate that the words were not their own but from God. This underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, as seen throughout the Bible, such as in the messages delivered by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>&#8216;You are not to go up and fight against your brothers:</b><br>The context here is the division of the united kingdom of Israel after Solomon's reign. Rehoboam, Solomon's son, was planning to fight against the northern tribes who had followed Jeroboam. The term "brothers" highlights the familial relationship between the tribes of Israel, emphasizing unity and peace over conflict. This reflects the biblical theme of brotherhood and reconciliation, as seen in the story of Joseph and his brothers in Genesis.<p><b>Each of you must return home:</b><br>This command to return home signifies a call to peace and a cessation of hostilities. It reflects God's desire for His people to live in harmony and avoid unnecessary bloodshed. The directive to return home also implies trust in God's sovereignty and His plans, similar to how the Israelites were instructed to trust God during their wilderness journey.<p><b>for this is My doing.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates God's sovereignty and control over the events unfolding in Israel. It reassures the people that the division of the kingdom is part of God's divine plan, even if it seems unfavorable. This echoes the biblical theme that God's ways are higher than human ways, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, and that He works all things for good, as stated in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<p><b>So they listened to the words of the LORD:</b><br>The people's obedience to God's command is a significant moment of faith and submission. Listening to God's word is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the importance of heeding divine instruction. This obedience is reminiscent of the Israelites' response to God's commands during the Exodus and their journey to the Promised Land.<p><b>and turned back from going against Jeroboam:</b><br>This action of turning back signifies repentance and a change of heart, aligning with the biblical call to turn away from conflict and sin. Jeroboam, who led the northern tribes, was part of God's plan to fulfill His purposes for Israel. The decision to not fight against Jeroboam reflects a recognition of God's will and a commitment to peace, similar to how David refrained from harming Saul, acknowledging God's anointed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, who initially sought to wage war against the northern tribes of Israel after the kingdom split.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who led the ten tribes in rebellion against Rehoboam's rule.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah.htm">Shemaiah</a></b><br>A man of God who delivered the LORD's message to Rehoboam and the people of Judah, instructing them not to fight against their brothers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_benjamin.htm">Judah and Benjamin</a></b><br>The two tribes that remained loyal to Rehoboam and formed the southern kingdom of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who intervened to prevent civil war among His people by commanding Rehoboam and his followers to stand down.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God's Word</a></b><br>Rehoboam's decision to listen to God's command through Shemaiah demonstrates the importance of obedience, even when it contradicts our initial plans or desires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The passage underscores God's control over the affairs of nations and individuals.
