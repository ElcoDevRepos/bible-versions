The Valley of Ben-hinnom, located southwest of Jerusalem, became notorious for such abominable practices, often associated with the worship of the Canaanite god Molech. This valley later became synonymous with Gehenna, a term used in the New Testament to describe hell (<a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>). The act of sacrificing children was a direct violation of God's commandments and demonstrated a severe departure from the faith of Israel. It highlights the extent of Manasseh's apostasy and the influence of surrounding pagan cultures on Judah.<p><b>He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists.</b><br>These practices were explicitly condemned in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). Sorcery and divination were attempts to gain knowledge or power through supernatural means, often invoking demonic forces. Consulting mediums and spiritists involved seeking guidance from the dead, which was considered an abomination. These actions reflect a reliance on occult practices rather than trust in God. The presence of such practices in Judah under Manasseh's reign indicates a significant spiritual decline and a turning away from the covenant relationship with Yahweh. This behavior contrasts sharply with the biblical call to seek wisdom and guidance from God alone (<a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19-20</a>).<p><b>He did great evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.</b><br>The phrase underscores the severity of Manasseh's actions from a divine perspective. "In the sight of the LORD" emphasizes that God is the ultimate judge of human behavior, and His standards are the measure of righteousness. The evil committed by Manasseh was not just a breach of social or cultural norms but a direct affront to God's holiness and covenant. Provoking God to anger suggests that Manasseh's actions were not only sinful but also persistent and unrepentant, leading to divine judgment. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where persistent disobedience leads to consequences, as seen in the eventual Babylonian exile (<a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3-4</a>).

This valley&#8212;later called Gehenna&#8212;became a symbol of final judgment (<a href="/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Child sacrifice was explicitly forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). That Manasseh offered his own sons shows how far Judah&#8217;s king had adopted the surrounding nations&#8217; detestable practices (<a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The act broke the first commandment by giving ultimate devotion to false gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and despised the God-given value of human life (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; This sin not only endangered Manasseh&#8217;s household but invited national judgment, as later prophets declared (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues: &#8220;He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists&#8221;. These practices sought knowledge and power apart from God&#8217;s revelation.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word had already warned Israel: &#8220;Let no one be found among you who practices divination&#8230; or who is a medium or spiritist&#8230; Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; By turning to the occult, Manasseh rejected God&#8217;s sufficiency and placed the nation under spiritual deception (<a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>; <a href="/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Such rebellion was not merely cultural syncretism; it was an intentional alliance with demonic powers (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>), eroding the covenant relationship that defined Judah&#8217;s identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He did great evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger</b><p>&#8226; Scripture gives God&#8217;s verdict: &#8220;He did great evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger&#8221;. This summarizes the cumulative weight of Manasseh&#8217;s sins.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s anger is His righteous response to sin that violates His holiness and harms His people (<a href="/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58-59</a>; <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;in the sight of the LORD&#8221; reminds us that no action is hidden from Him (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Manasseh&#8217;s public policies became personal affronts to the covenant-keeping God.<p>&#8226; The result was inevitable judgment: Babylonian captivity awaited (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>), though God still extended mercy when Manasseh humbled himself (33:12-13), illustrating both divine justice and grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a> reveals the depths of Manasseh&#8217;s apostasy: murderous idolatry, occult practices, and a lifestyle that provoked God&#8217;s righteous anger. Each clause exposes a deliberate rejection of God&#8217;s law and character. Yet the broader chapter shows that even such darkness is not beyond God&#8217;s reach when repentance occurs. The verse therefore serves as both a sober warning against sin&#8217;s progression and a reminder of the Lord&#8217;s unwavering commitment to justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">He.</span>--Emphatic.

The heavy yoke of Assyria again weighed the nation down, and the great deliverance under Hezekiah was almost forgotten. "To all the Palestinian nations the Assyrian crisis had made careless confidence in the help of their national deities a thing impossible. As life was embittered by foreign bondage, the darker aspects of heathenism became dominant. The wrath of the gods seemed more real than their favour; atoning ordinances were multiplied, human sacrifices became more frequent, the terror which hung over all the nations that groaned under the Assyrian yoke found habitual expression in the ordinances of worship; and it was this aspect of heathenism that came to the front in Manasseh's imitations of foreign religion" (Robertson Smith, <span class= "ital">The Prophets of Israel,</span> p. 366). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Caused his children</span>. Parallel (<a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>), "his <span class="accented">son</span>," in the singular number (see also <a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a> compared with our <a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>). There can be no doubt that this worst of cruel abominations, learned from Ammon and Moab, amounted to nothing less than the sacrifice of the child in the fire. It is, perhaps, something remarkable that we do not encounter anywhere any description of the exact manner of administration of this cruelty, and of its taking effect on the pitiable victim. The solemn commands of <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a> bespeak sufficiently distinctly the prevision and earnest precaution of the Divine Ruler of Israel, through Moses, on behalf of his people.

On an elevation at the eastern extremity of this valley it was that Solomon erected "high places" to Moloch, entailing on himself a long and dire responsibility (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>). Consult also our <a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a> and note there; with added reference, Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 172, 482. <span class="cmt_word">Also he observed times</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and he practised augury.</span> The Hebrew word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>.

There is difficulty in fixing its exact meaning, though its general meaning may be embraced in the words of the Revised Version. A likely meaning, judging from derivation, may be the practising augury from observing of the <span class="accented">clouds.</span> The passages in Leviticus and Deuteronomy are those that of old solemnly prohibited it. <span class="cmt_word">And used enchantments</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>; the root is the familiar word for "serpent."
