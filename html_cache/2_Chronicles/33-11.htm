The Assyrian Empire was a dominant force during this period, known for its military prowess and expansionist policies. The Assyrians were often instruments of God's judgment, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>, where Assyria is called the "rod of My anger." This reflects the biblical theme that God is sovereign over nations and uses them to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>who captured Manasseh</b><br>Manasseh was the king of Judah, known for his idolatry and leading the nation into sin (<a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21:1-9</a>). His capture signifies the consequences of turning away from God. Historically, Assyrian records mention vassal kings being taken captive, which aligns with the biblical account. This event underscores the biblical principle that sin leads to judgment, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>, where disobedience results in being taken captive by foreign nations.<p><b>put a hook in his nose</b><br>This phrase describes a humiliating and painful method of captivity used by the Assyrians, as depicted in their reliefs and historical records. It symbolizes total subjugation and disgrace. The imagery of a hook in the nose is also found in <a href="/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>, where God speaks of leading Egypt away with hooks. This act serves as a vivid reminder of the consequences of pride and rebellion against God.<p><b>bound him with bronze shackles</b><br>Bronze shackles indicate a secure and degrading form of imprisonment. Bronze, a strong metal, symbolizes the strength of the captors and the helplessness of the captive. This detail highlights the severity of Manasseh's punishment and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about exile and bondage for disobedience, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>.<p><b>and took him to Babylon</b><br>Although Assyria was the dominant power, Babylon was a significant city within the empire and later became the center of power. This foreshadows the Babylonian captivity of Judah, which occurs later in biblical history (2 Kings 24-25). Babylon often represents a place of exile and judgment in scripture, as seen in <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17-18</a>, where it symbolizes opposition to God. Manasseh's exile to Babylon prefigures the greater exile of Judah and serves as a call to repentance and reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who exercises judgment and mercy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his idolatry and evil practices, but later repented.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/commanders_of_the_army_of_the_king_of_assyria.htm">Commanders of the army of the king of Assyria</a></b><br>Military leaders used by God to execute judgment on Manasseh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire during this period, known for its military might and conquests.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place where Manasseh was taken captive, symbolizing exile and punishment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_discipline.htm">God's Sovereignty in Discipline</a></b><br>God uses nations and leaders as instruments of His judgment.

The progress of cuneiform research, however, has proved the perfect possibility of the facts most disputed, viz., the captivity and subsequent restoration of Manasseh.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Wherefore.</span>--<span class= "ital">And.</span><p><span class= "bld">The captains of the host of the king of Assyria.</span>--The generals of Esarhaddon, or rather, perhaps, of Assurbanipal. The former, who reigned from 681-668 B.C. , has recorded the fact that Manasseh was his vassal. He says: "And I assembled the kings of the land of Hatti, and the marge of the sea, Baal king of Tyre, Me-na-si-e (or Mi-in-si-e) king of Ya-u-di (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Judah), Qa-us-gabri, king of Edom," &c. "Altogether, twenty-two kings of the land of Hatti [Syria], the coast of the sea, and the middle of the sea, all of them, I caused to hasten," &c. Assurbanipal has left a list which is identical with that of Esarhaddon, except that it gives different names for the kings of Arvad and Ammon. It thus appears that Manasseh paid tribute to him as well as to his father. Schrader (<span class= "ital">K.A.T.,</span> p. 367, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) thinks that Manasseh was at least suspected of being implicated along with the other princes of Phoenicia-Palestine in the revolt of Assurbanipars brother <span class= "ital">Samar-sum-ukin</span> (circ. 648-647 B.C. ) in which Elam, Gutium, and Meroe also participated; and that he was carried to Babylon, to clear himself of suspicion, and to give assurances of his fidelity to the great king.<p><span class= "bld">Which took Manasseh among the thorns.</span>--<span class= "ital">And they took Manasseh prisoner with the hooks</span> (<span class= "ital">ba-h?oh?im</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The <span class= "ital">hooks</span> might be such as the Assyrian kings were wont to pass through the nostrils and lips of their more distinguished prisoners.
