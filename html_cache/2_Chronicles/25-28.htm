The use of horses indicates a measure of respect and urgency in returning the king's body to his homeland. Horses were valuable and often associated with royalty and military power in ancient Israel. This act of carrying a king on horses signifies the honor given to him despite his failures. In biblical times, horses were not commonly used for burial processions, which highlights the significance of this event.<p><b>and buried him with his fathers</b><br>The phrase "buried him with his fathers" is a common biblical expression indicating that Amaziah was laid to rest in the royal tombs, alongside previous kings of Judah. This burial practice underscores the importance of family lineage and the continuation of the Davidic line, which is central to the biblical narrative. It also reflects the cultural emphasis on honoring one's ancestors and maintaining family heritage. The burial of kings with their ancestors is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the accounts of other kings such as David and Solomon.<p><b>in the City of Judah</b><br>The "City of Judah" refers to Jerusalem, the capital city and spiritual center of the kingdom of Judah. Jerusalem holds significant historical and theological importance as the site of the Temple, the dwelling place of God among His people. The city's mention here emphasizes its role as the final resting place for the kings of Judah, reinforcing its status as the heart of the nation. Jerusalem's prominence in biblical prophecy and its connection to the lineage of David, from which Jesus Christ is descended, further highlights its importance in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned after his father Joash.

Loyal subjects retrieved him&#8212;an act of respect that echoes how Saul&#8217;s men rescued his body from Philistine territory (<a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>). Though Amaziah&#8217;s reign ended in disgrace, God&#8217;s providence allowed a dignified return, fulfilling the pattern seen when Joash was also brought back for burial (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>). In each case the Lord preserved Israel&#8217;s covenant line even when kings faltered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on horses</b><p>Transporting a royal corpse &#8220;on horses&#8221; reflected honor and urgency:<p>&#8226; Horses were symbols of royal power (<a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>).<p>&#8226; A swift return prevented desecration (see <a href="/ruth/1-6.htm">Ruth 1:6</a> for haste tied to covenant loyalty).<p>&#8226; The phrase matches the parallel record in <a href="/2_kings/14-20.htm">2 Kings 14:20</a>, underscoring the historical reliability of both narratives.
