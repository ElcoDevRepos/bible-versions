This practice was part of the reforms initiated by King Hezekiah to ensure the proper functioning of temple services. The distribution of portions was a practical application of the law, as seen in <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-20</a>, where the Levites and priests were to receive their sustenance from the offerings brought by the people.<p><b>to the males registered by genealogy</b><br>Genealogical registration was crucial for maintaining the purity and order of the Levitical priesthood. This ensured that only those who were legitimate descendants of Levi could serve in the temple, as prescribed in the Torah (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). This practice underscores the importance of lineage and heritage in maintaining the sanctity of religious service.<p><b>who were three years of age or older</b><br>The mention of "three years of age or older" indicates the early involvement of Levites in temple service, though active service likely began at a later age. This early registration ensured that the community was aware of those who would eventually serve, reflecting the importance of preparing future generations for their roles in worship and service.<p><b>to all who would enter the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. This phrase emphasizes the sacredness of the temple and the significance of those who were permitted to enter and serve. The temple was not only a place of worship but also a symbol of God's presence among His people.<p><b>for their daily duties for service</b><br>Daily duties in the temple included a range of activities such as offering sacrifices, maintaining the temple's cleanliness, and conducting worship services.

The meaning is that the Levites who were on duty in the Temple, and whose names were registered as such, along with their male children of three years old and upwards, were not provided for by Cononiah and his associates, as they received their daily portion in the sanctuary itself. Children, it appears, were allowed to accompany their fathers to the Temple, and to eat with them of the sacrifices.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside their</span> <span class="cmt_word">genealogy of males</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> except (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) the family count of males, etc., the remainder of the verse describing those who are meant by the <span class="accented">excepted.</span> They were excepted because for themselves and their little ones, their daily present temple service brought their daily maintenance as of course. The "unto every one" of our version is misleading. Keil translates perspicuously, "of all those who entered the house of the Lord, to the daily portion for their service," etc. The glimpse of the picture of the little children fed for the sake of their fathers' sanctuary service, so true to the true religion even of nature, is a pleasant glimpse to catch. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/31-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In addition,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1438;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7687;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m, Preposition-l &#124;
