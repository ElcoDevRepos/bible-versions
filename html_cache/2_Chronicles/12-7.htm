In the biblical context, humility is often a prerequisite for divine intervention and mercy. The Israelites' act of humbling themselves is a response to the prophetic warning given by Shemaiah. This reflects a recurring theme in Scripture where God responds favorably to those who repent and humble themselves, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a> and <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>.<p><b>the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying</b><br>Shemaiah was a prophet during the reign of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. Prophets in the Old Testament served as God's messengers, delivering His word to the people. The phrase indicates that God communicated directly with His prophets, who then relayed His messages to the people. This divine communication underscores the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people, similar to how Moses and Elijah functioned in their times.<p><b>They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them</b><br>God's decision not to destroy the Israelites demonstrates His mercy and willingness to forgive. This is consistent with His character as described throughout the Bible, where He is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). The conditional nature of God's judgment is evident here, as their humility leads to a reprieve from destruction, echoing the narrative of Nineveh in <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>.<p><b>but will soon grant them deliverance</b><br>Deliverance in the Old Testament often refers to God rescuing His people from physical or spiritual danger. In this context, it implies a reprieve from the impending threat posed by Shishak, the king of Egypt. This deliverance is a testament to God's faithfulness to His covenant people, reminiscent of the deliverance from Egypt during the Exodus (Exodus 14).<p><b>My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak</b><br>Shishak's invasion is historically documented in Egyptian records, corroborating the biblical account. The phrase indicates that while Shishak did invade Judah, the full extent of God's wrath was withheld due to the people's repentance. This restraint is a demonstration of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to use foreign powers as instruments of judgment or mercy, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> with Assyria. The sparing of Jerusalem also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who provides a way to escape God's wrath through His sacrifice (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who responds to the humility of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah.htm">Shemaiah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who delivers the LORD's message to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Solomon, who initially led the nation into sin but later humbled himself.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shishak.htm">Shishak</a></b><br>The king of Egypt who invaded Judah as a consequence of their unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, spared from destruction due to the people's repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_humility.htm">The Power of Humility</a></b><br>Humility before God can change the course of events.
