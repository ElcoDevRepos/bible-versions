Asa cut down</span>. So it was enjoined (<a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And stamped it</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>; hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>; the meaning being "stamped it" in the dust, from its upright position, finally burning it. The word is used in <a href="/2_chronicles/34-4.htm">2 Chronicles 34:4, 7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6, 15</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-36.htm">Exodus 30:36</a>; <a href="/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>. The word used in the parallel is "cut off;" or "cut down; of course also preparatory to burning. <span class="cmt_word">At the brook Kidron</span>. The Kidron was a torrent rather than a <span class="accented">brook</span>. It flowed between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and finally emptied itself into the Dead Sea. The references to Kidron in the Old Testament are interesting, but all reinvested with heightened interest from those in the New Testament (<a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>, compared with what the parallels infer; <a href="/mark/14-26.htm">Mark 14:26</a>; <a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a>). The first two references in the Old Testament are <a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-37.htm">1 Kings 2:37</a>. Passing these, the present place, with its parallel, brings the Kidren valley next under notice as, the place of destruction for Maachah's obscene phallic abomination, and then (<a href="/2_kings/11-16.htm">2 Kings 11:16</a>) as the place where Athalish was destroyed. Its associations are similar when spoken of in <a href="/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4, 6, 12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-16.htm">2 Chronicles 29:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-14.htm">2 Chronicles 30:14</a>, becoming the "regular receptacle for the impurities and abominations of the idol-worship, when removed from the temple and destroyed by the adherents of Jehovah." In the time of Josiah, this valley was the common burying-place of the city (<a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>). (For Robinson's description of the modern state of the Kidron valley, see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:14-16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
