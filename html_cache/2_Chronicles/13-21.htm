His strength is attributed to his military success and consolidation of power, particularly after his victory over Jeroboam, the king of Israel, as described earlier in <a href="/2_chronicles/13.htm">2 Chronicles 13</a>. This victory was seen as a divine endorsement of his rule, reinforcing the Davidic line's legitimacy. The phrase "grew strong" suggests not only physical or military might but also political stability and influence, which were crucial for maintaining control over the kingdom.<p><b>married fourteen wives</b><br>Polygamy was a common practice among ancient Near Eastern royalty, often used to secure political alliances and demonstrate wealth and power. Abijah's multiple marriages reflect the customs of his time and the continuation of practices seen in his predecessors, such as David and Solomon. This practice, while culturally accepted, often led to familial and political complications, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures. The large number of wives also underscores the king's status and resources.<p><b>and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters</b><br>The large number of offspring signifies Abijah's efforts to ensure a lasting dynasty and secure his lineage. In the context of ancient monarchies, having many children was a way to strengthen one's legacy and influence. The mention of both sons and daughters highlights the importance of family in royal succession and the potential for political alliances through marriage. This detail also reflects the biblical emphasis on genealogy and the continuation of the Davidic line, which is significant in the broader narrative of Israel's history and the anticipation of the Messiah, who would come from this lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Rehoboam, and grandson of Solomon.
