Their role was crucial in maintaining the worship and rituals prescribed by the Law of Moses. The instruments of David refer to the musical instruments that King David, a skilled musician himself, had established for worship in the Temple. David's contributions to worship music are significant, as he organized the Levites into choirs and orchestras, enhancing the worship experience (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>). This phrase highlights the continuity of worship practices from David's time, emphasizing the importance of music in worship and the Levites' role in leading it. The use of these instruments signifies a return to proper worship practices, aligning with the reforms King Hezekiah was implementing to restore the Temple and its services.<p><b>and the priests with the trumpets</b><br>The priests, distinct from the Levites, were descendants of Aaron and had specific duties related to sacrifices and offerings. The trumpets mentioned here are likely the silver trumpets described in <a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>, used for calling the assembly and signaling the start of festivals and sacrifices. These trumpets were integral to the worship and ceremonial life of Israel, symbolizing God's presence and guidance. The priests' use of trumpets in this context underscores the solemnity and significance of the occasion, as they were often used in times of celebration, battle, and worship. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of worship and the role of music and sound in expressing devotion to God. It also foreshadows the eschatological imagery in Revelation, where trumpets announce significant events in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties, particularly in the temple.

In the context of Hezekiah&#8217;s temple restoration (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-12.htm">2 Chronicles 29:12-17</a>), the Levites respond immediately when called, reflecting their God-given duty to &#8220;stand before the LORD to minister&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Their standing also conveys unity; note how similar language is used when Levites carry the ark in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-15.htm">1 Chronicles 15:15-17</a>. They are not spectators but active participants in worship, setting an example for all Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the instruments of David</b><p>&#8226; David had organized temple music generations earlier, assigning Levites to praise God &#8220;with instruments I have provided for that purpose&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>). By using those same instruments, Hezekiah roots his reform in established, God-honoring tradition rather than inventing something new.<p>&#8226; The continuity underscores the lasting value of David&#8217;s God-given pattern (see also <a href="/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>). These were not casual instruments; they were consecrated tools designed to lift hearts to the LORD (<a href="/psalms/150-3.htm">Psalm 150:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Their usage signals a return to covenant faithfulness after the apostasy of Ahaz (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">2 Chronicles 28:24-25</a>). Revival often involves recovering what faithful ancestors already knew to be true.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the priests with the trumpets</b><p>&#8226; Trumpets were reserved for priests (<a href="/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8-10</a>) and carried specific purposes: summoning the assembly, signaling travel, and proclaiming joyous worship. Here, the priests use them to announce renewed sacrifices and celebrate God&#8217;s mercy (compare <a href="/1_chronicles/16-6.htm">1 Chronicles 16:6</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The pairing of Levites (stringed and percussion instruments) with priests (trumpets) shows ordered cooperation within God&#8217;s design: distinct roles, one unified praise (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-28.htm">2 Chronicles 29:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The sharp, clear sound of trumpets cuts through complacency, calling the nation to attention. This echoes the prophetic call in <a href="/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a> to &#8220;blow the trumpet in Zion&#8221; when seeking the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/29-26.htm">2 Chronicles 29:26</a> presents a snapshot of restored worship: Levites standing ready, playing the very instruments David ordained, while priests herald God&#8217;s glory with trumpets. It illustrates obedience to God&#8217;s established pattern, unity among different ministry roles, and the joy of revival when a nation returns to wholehearted praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">The</span> <span class= "bld">instruments of David.</span>--See on <a href="/1_chronicles/23-5.htm" title="Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.">1Chronicles 23:5</a>.
