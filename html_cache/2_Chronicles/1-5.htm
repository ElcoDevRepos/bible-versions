Bezalel was from the tribe of Judah, and his craftsmanship was instrumental in constructing the Tabernacle and its furnishings. The altar was used for burnt offerings, a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The mention of Bezalel highlights the continuity of worship practices from the time of Moses to Solomon, emphasizing the importance of adhering to divinely ordained methods of worship.<p><b>was in Gibeon before the tabernacle of the LORD</b><br>Gibeon was a significant location during this period, serving as a central place of worship before the Temple was built in Jerusalem. The Tabernacle, originally constructed in the wilderness, had been moved to Gibeon, making it a focal point for Israelite worship. This setting underscores the transitional phase in Israel's religious life, moving from the mobile Tabernacle to the permanent Temple. Gibeon's role as a high place also reflects the historical context where centralized worship in Jerusalem had not yet been fully established.<p><b>So Solomon and the assembly inquired of Him there</b><br>Solomon, newly anointed as king, sought divine guidance at Gibeon, demonstrating his dependence on God for wisdom and leadership. This act of inquiry was a common practice, reflecting the cultural and religious norms of seeking God's will through prayer and sacrifice. The assembly's participation indicates a collective acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the importance of communal worship. This event foreshadows Solomon's later request for wisdom, a defining moment in his reign (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-14</a>), and highlights the importance of seeking God's guidance in leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the bronze altar.

The continuity underscores that true worship must follow God-given patterns, not human innovation (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was in Gibeon before the tabernacle of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; After the ark moved to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>), the tabernacle and its furnishings&#8212;including this altar&#8212;remained in Gibeon (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39&#8211;40</a>; 21:29).<p>&#8226; Gibeon thus served as Israel&#8217;s principal place of sacrifice until the temple was built (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse assumes the reader knows the tabernacle&#8217;s purpose: a meeting place where God&#8217;s presence dwelt and sacrifices atoned for sin (<a href="/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>).<p>&#8226; The physical location matters.

The verse ties the new king to the wilderness altar built by Bezalel, locates that altar at Gibeon with the tabernacle, and records Solomon&#8217;s corporate seeking of the Lord there. The message is clear: authentic leadership and national blessing flow from honoring God&#8217;s prescribed means of worship and earnestly seeking His guidance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Moreover the brasen altar . . . he put before the tabernacle of the Lord.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And the brasen altar . . .</span> <span class= "ital">was there before the dwelling of Jehovah.</span> In Hebrew, <span class= "ital">sh?m</span> is "there"; and <span class= "ital">s?m,</span> "he put." Some MSS., supported by the LXX. and Vulg., read the former; most of the MSS. and the Syr., Arab., and Targ., the latter. The former reading is preferable, as it is not likely that David found the brazen altar separated from the Mosaic sanctuary, and restored it to its place.

This statement is introduced to lay stress on the fact that, though the ark indeed was not with the tabernacle, the brazen altar of burnt offering assuredly was there, this constituting the place, the proper spot, for sacrifice and worship. (For the account of the brazen altar and its making, see <a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a>; also <a href="/numbers/16-38.htm">Numbers 16:38, 39</a>.) This altar of burnt offering is often spoken of as the altar, to distinguish it from the altar of incense (<a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-38.htm">Exodus 39:38</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-11.htm">Numbers 4:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bezaleel</span>.

The reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), "was <span class="accented">there</span> before<span class="accented"></span>," is to be preferred, tallying as it does exactly with <a href="/exodus/40-6.htm">Exodus 40:6</a>.
