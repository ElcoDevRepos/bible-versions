This period is significant as it follows the Feast of Weeks (Shavuot), a time of harvest and thanksgiving. The timing indicates that the people were bringing in the firstfruits of their harvest, a practice commanded in the Law of Moses (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>, <a href="/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15-21</a>). This act of obedience reflects a renewed commitment to the covenant and the Law under King Hezekiah's reforms.<p><b>they began building up the heaps</b><br>The heaps refer to the piles of offerings brought by the Israelites, consisting of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and all the produce of the field. This abundance signifies the people's generosity and the blessings of God upon the land. The act of building up heaps symbolizes a collective effort to restore proper worship and support the Levitical priesthood, as prescribed in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22-29</a>). It also demonstrates the people's response to Hezekiah's call for religious reform and revival.<p><b>and they finished in the seventh month</b><br>The seventh month, Tishri, corresponds to September and October. This month is marked by significant religious observances, including the Feast of Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/leviticus/23-23.htm">Leviticus 23:23-44</a>). The completion of the heaps by this time suggests a period of sustained dedication and effort by the people. It also aligns with the agricultural cycle, as the end of the harvest season would naturally conclude with the final gathering of produce. This period of completion underscores the themes of repentance, renewal, and celebration of God's provision, paralleling the spiritual renewal under Hezekiah's leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms, including the restoration of temple worship and the reinstitution of tithes and offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Hezekiah reigned and implemented his reforms.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_month.htm">The Third Month</a></b><br>Corresponds to the month of Sivan in the Hebrew calendar, a time of harvest and the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seventh_month.htm">The Seventh Month</a></b><br>Corresponds to the month of Tishri, which includes significant Jewish festivals such as the Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, and Feast of Tabernacles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaps.htm">Heaps</a></b><br>Refers to the piles of offerings and tithes brought by the people in response to Hezekiah's reforms, symbolizing abundance and obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Hezekiah's reforms and the people's response demonstrate the importance of aligning our lives with God's instructions.
