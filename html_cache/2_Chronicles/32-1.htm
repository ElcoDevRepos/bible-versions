Hezekiah's acts of faithfulness included restoring temple worship, celebrating the Passover, and removing idolatry from the land (2 Chronicles 29-31). These actions were in obedience to God's commands and demonstrated a commitment to the covenant relationship with Yahweh. Despite these acts of faithfulness, Judah still faced external threats, illustrating that faithfulness to God does not exempt one from trials or challenges.<p><b>Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah</b><br>Sennacherib was the king of Assyria from 705 to 681 BC, known for his military campaigns and expansion of the Assyrian Empire. His invasion of Judah occurred around 701 BC. Assyria was the dominant power in the Near East at the time, and Sennacherib's campaign was part of a larger effort to subdue rebellious vassal states. The invasion of Judah was a significant event, as it tested the faith and leadership of Hezekiah. This historical context highlights the geopolitical tensions of the period and the threat posed by Assyria to smaller nations like Judah.<p><b>He laid siege to the fortified cities</b><br>The fortified cities of Judah were strategically important for defense and control of the region. Archaeological evidence, such as the Lachish reliefs found in Nineveh, depicts the Assyrian siege of Lachish, one of Judah's key fortified cities. Sieges were a common military tactic in the ancient world, involving surrounding a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. The mention of fortified cities underscores the severity of the threat and the military prowess of the Assyrian army.<p><b>intending to conquer them for himself</b><br>Sennacherib's intention to conquer the fortified cities of Judah reflects the Assyrian policy of expansion and control. Conquering these cities would have extended Assyrian influence and secured valuable resources and strategic locations. This phrase also highlights the personal ambition of Sennacherib, as he sought to expand his empire and assert his dominance. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of Judah's reliance on God versus political and military alliances. The narrative sets the stage for God's deliverance of Jerusalem, demonstrating His sovereignty and power over even the mightiest of earthly kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah known for his faithfulness to God, who initiated religious reforms and trusted in the Lord during times of crisis.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, a powerful empire known for its military might and conquests, who invaded Judah during Hezekiah's reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Hezekiah ruled, known for its capital, Jerusalem, and its significance in biblical history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/siege_of_the_fortified_cities.htm">Siege of the Fortified Cities</a></b><br>Sennacherib's military strategy to capture the fortified cities of Judah, aiming to weaken and eventually conquer the kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/acts_of_faithfulness.htm">Acts of Faithfulness</a></b><br>Refers to Hezekiah's religious reforms and dedication to God, which preceded the Assyrian invasion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Hezekiah's acts of faithfulness did not prevent trials but prepared him to face them with trust in God.

For the date, see Note on <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2Kings 18:13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Sennacherib.</span>--So the Vulg.

I approached, I took." The chronicler's object is to relate the mighty deliverance of Hezekiah. Hence he omits such details as would weaken the impression he desires to produce. For the same reason nothing is said here of Hezekiah's submission and payment of tribute (<a href="/context/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.">2Kings 18:14-16</a>); and perhaps for the further reason (as suggested by Keil) that "these negotiations had no influence on the after-course and issue of the war," but <span class= "ital">not</span> because (as Thenius alleges) the chronicler was unwilling to mention Hezekiah's (forced) sacrilege. They are omitted also in Isaiah, where the account is in other respects abridged as compared with Kings. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The establishment thereof;</span> translate, and this (his) <span class="accented">truth</span>.
