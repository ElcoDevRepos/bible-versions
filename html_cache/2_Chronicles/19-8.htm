His appointment of officials in Jerusalem signifies a centralization of judicial authority, reflecting the importance of Jerusalem as the spiritual and administrative center of Judah. This action aligns with his broader reforms to ensure justice and adherence to God's laws.<p><b>some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the Israelite families</b><br>The Levites and priests were integral to the religious life of Israel, responsible for temple duties and teaching the Law. By involving them in judicial matters, Jehoshaphat ensured that decisions were grounded in the Law of God. The heads of the Israelite families, or tribal leaders, brought wisdom and experience, representing the people and ensuring that justice was administered fairly. This combination of religious and lay leaders highlights a theocratic approach to governance.<p><b>to judge on behalf of the LORD</b><br>Judging on behalf of the LORD implies that these appointed officials were to administer justice according to divine standards, not merely human wisdom. This reflects the biblical principle that true justice is rooted in God's character and law. It underscores the belief that God is the ultimate judge, and human judges are His representatives, tasked with upholding His righteousness.<p><b>and to settle disputes</b><br>The role of these appointed officials was not only to judge but also to mediate and resolve conflicts among the people. This function was crucial for maintaining peace and order in society. The emphasis on settling disputes aligns with the biblical call for justice and reconciliation, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, which instructs the appointment of judges to ensure justice.<p><b>And they lived in Jerusalem</b><br>The residence of these officials in Jerusalem ensured their availability and accessibility to the people seeking justice. It also placed them in close proximity to the temple, reinforcing the connection between civil and religious duties. Living in Jerusalem, the city of David and the location of the temple, symbolized their commitment to serving God and the community.

This echoes God&#8217;s earlier command that difficult cases be taken to &#8220;the place the LORD will choose&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-10</a>). Centralizing justice<p>&#8226; promoted consistent judgment (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>),<p>&#8226; underscored Jerusalem&#8217;s role as spiritual and civic heart (2 Chron 6:6),<p>&#8226; modeled orderly leadership for the nation (<a href="/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the Israelite families</b><p>Jehoshaphat blends three leadership streams:<p>&#8226; Levites&#8212;already tasked with teaching the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Priests&#8212;guardians of the sanctuary who knew God&#8217;s statutes (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Family heads&#8212;experienced elders respected by their clans (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>).<p>By combining spiritual and secular leaders, he mirrors the pattern Moses used when he chose &#8220;able men&#8221; yet still consulted Aaron and Hur (<a href="/exodus/18-24.htm">Exodus 18:24-26</a>; 24:14).

Jehoshaphat had just warned other judges, &#8220;You are not judging for man but for the LORD&#8221; (2 Chron 19:6).

Of course every father was head of his own family, but only one (such as in modern times by primogeniture the eldest son) the representative head of the entire family, and under this expression is no doubt naturally set forth only those families that were of some relative consideration or distinction. <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">the judgment of the Lord, and for controversies.</span> Considering the plainer distinction in the language of vex. 11, there can be no doubt that the words, "for the judgment of the Lord," do not intend simply to describe godly judgment, but point to dues payable to the Lord in some religious aspect: "Render to Caesar... and to God the things that are God's" (<a href="/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>; <a href="/mark/12-17.htm">Mark 12:17</a>; <a href="/luke/20-25.htm">Luke 20:25</a>); while the words, "and for controversies," point to the mutual strifes of the people. <span class="cmt_word">When they returned</span>; Hebrew, "and they returned." It has been proposed to remove this clause so as to begin the next verse with it (and so the Revised Version shows as a clause by itself, "And they returned to Jerusalem"), and, to make this fit the better, the word <span class="accented">did</span> in the first line of the verse is changed into "had." It is, however, possible to render the clause, "And they dwelt in Jerusalem,' which would make a far mere coherent sense, and would mark the permanence and stationariness of this chief court. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In Jerusalem</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1440;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#238;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;lim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
