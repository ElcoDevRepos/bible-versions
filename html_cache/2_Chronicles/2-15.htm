Solomon refers to Hiram as "my lord," indicating a recognition of Hiram's authority and a desire for continued cooperation. This relationship is significant as it highlights the political alliances that were crucial for Solomon's building projects, including the Temple. The term "servants" refers to the workers and craftsmen who were skilled in various trades, particularly those from Tyre who were renowned for their expertise in timber and stonework.<p><b>the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine</b><br>These commodities were essential staples in the ancient Near Eastern diet and economy. Wheat and barley were primary grains used for making bread, a daily sustenance. Olive oil was used not only for cooking but also for lighting lamps and religious anointing. Wine was a common beverage and also used in religious rituals. The mention of these specific items indicates the wealth and agricultural productivity of Israel under Solomon's reign. It also reflects the trade agreements between Israel and Tyre, where Israel provided agricultural products in exchange for Tyre's building materials and skilled labor.<p><b>he promised</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of keeping promises and fulfilling agreements, a key aspect of maintaining trust and cooperation between nations. The promise likely refers to a formal agreement or treaty between Solomon and Hiram, which was common in ancient diplomatic relations. This agreement facilitated the construction of the Temple, a central place of worship for Israel and a symbol of God's presence among His people. The fulfillment of promises in this context can also be seen as a reflection of God's faithfulness to His covenant with Israel, as Solomon's Temple was a fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his son building a house for the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.
