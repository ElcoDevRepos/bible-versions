The congregation, as well as the sacerdotal order, had consecrated themselves anew to Jehovah, by their presence and participation in the previous solemnities. Others suppose that these words are spoken to the priests only, and that then the king turns to the congregation with the words "Come near," &c. (There should be a semicolon after "the Lord.") . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have consecrated yourselves</span>. The Hebrew text is (with the margin of both Authorized and Revised Versions), "have filled your hands to Jehovah." Our somewhat awkward and somewhat misleading reproduction in English of the Hebrew text is, nevertheless, on the whole defensible. The phrase occurs some seventeen times (<a href="/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9, 29, 33, 35</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-29.htm">Exodus 32:29</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-32.htm">Leviticus 16:32</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-3.htm">Numbers 3:3</a>; <a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5, 12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-5.htm">1 Chronicles 29:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-9.htm">2 Chronicles 13:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-26.htm">Ezekiel 43:26</a>), and in some of these instances is most conveniently represented by the rendering "consecrate." The plural noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, is found thirteen times, in three of which places it is spoken of "stones to be set," as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "for" or "in the ephod" (<a href="/exodus/25-7.htm">Exodus 25:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-9.htm">Exodus 35:9, 27</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>); and in the other ten, of "consecration," as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "a ram of consecration," "the ram of Aaron's consecration" (<a href="/exodus/29-22.htm">Exodus 29:22, 26, 27, 31, 34</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-37.htm">Leviticus 7:37</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-22.htm">Leviticus 8:22, 28, 29, 31, 33</a>). Some think our text, "Now ye have consecrated yourselves," glances at the sacrifices of a propitiatory sort, which had just been completed; others, that the reference is by <span class="accented">anticipation - to</span> the fact that the people invited to draw near had, in an honourable, holy, and sincerely devoted way, armed themselves with worthy offerings. <span class="cmt_word">The sacrifices and thank offerings</span> were sacrifices "of thank offerings," in the nature of the peace <span class="accented">offerings</span> (<a href="/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-21, 29-36</a>). The burnt offerings marked the "free heart," inasmuch as there was nothing of them reserved from the consuming of the altar for use. <span class="cmt_word">As many as were of a free heart;</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>. Among some sixty occurrences of this word, in its verb, noun, or (as hero) adjective form, perhaps the most touching and beautifully expressive is that of <a href="/psalms/60-12.htm">Psalm 60:12</a>, "Uphold me with thy free Spirit." <span class="cmt_word">Sacrifices</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. This is the plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>- a word that expresses the generic idea, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the feast of sacrifice; again, the act of slaying and sacrificing a victim; again, the victim itself; again, those <span class="accented">kinds</span> of sacrifices that were expiatory or eucharistic, but <span class="accented">not</span> holocaustic (<a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>). <span class="accented">Thank offerings</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. This word occurs about thirty-two times; in about two-thirds of that number denoting the spiritual acts of giving of thanks, even when accompanied by the figurative idea of "sacrifices" (<a href="/psalms/56-13.htm">Psalm 56:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/107-22.htm">Psalm 107:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/116-17.htm">Psalm 116:17</a>), the genuine adoring praise or thanksgiving constituting the sacrifice; and in the other third denoting strictly sacrificial offerings, as several times in Leviticus (Leviticus 7:12; 22:29) and here. Our <a href="/2_chronicles/33-16.htm">2 Chronicles 33:16</a> classifies these with "peace offerings" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), as do many other passages with "burnt offerings" generally (<a href="/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>;
