Solomon's reign is marked by wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects, including the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. His reign is also characterized by political alliances and trade, which brought prosperity to Israel. The phrase "from beginning to end" implies a complete record, emphasizing the importance of Solomon's entire life and reign in Israel's history.<p><b>are they not written in the Records of Nathan the Prophet,</b><br>Nathan the Prophet was a significant figure during the reigns of David and Solomon. He is known for confronting David about his sin with Bathsheba and for supporting Solomon's succession to the throne. The mention of "the Records of Nathan the Prophet" suggests that there were other historical documents or writings that chronicled the events of Solomon's reign, which were well-known to the original audience. This highlights the role of prophets not only as spiritual leaders but also as historians and record-keepers.<p><b>in the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite,</b><br>Ahijah the Shilonite was a prophet who played a crucial role in the division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign. He prophesied that Jeroboam would rule over ten of the twelve tribes of Israel, leading to the split between the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The mention of Ahijah's prophecy underscores the fulfillment of God's word and the divine orchestration of Israel's history. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of Solomon's idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>and in the Visions of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?</b><br>Iddo the Seer is another prophetic figure whose visions are mentioned in connection with Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel. The reference to Iddo's visions indicates that there were multiple prophetic voices that spoke into the political and spiritual dynamics of the time. Jeroboam's rise to power and subsequent actions are significant in the biblical narrative, as they set the stage for the ongoing conflict and idolatry that plagued the northern kingdom. The inclusion of these records and visions highlights the importance of prophecy in understanding and interpreting the events of Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the First Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>A prophet during the reigns of David and Solomon, Nathan is known for confronting David about his sin with Bathsheba and for supporting Solomon's succession to the throne.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahijah_the_shilonite.htm">Ahijah the Shilonite</a></b><br>A prophet from Shiloh who played a significant role in the division of the kingdom by prophesying that Jeroboam would rule over ten tribes of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/iddo_the_seer.htm">Iddo the Seer</a></b><br>A seer or prophet who recorded visions concerning Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_son_of_nebat.htm">Jeroboam son of Nebat</a></b><br>An official under Solomon who became the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the kingdom split.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prophetic_witness.htm">The Importance of Prophetic Witness</a></b><br>The mention of multiple prophets and seers underscores the importance of prophetic witness in understanding and recording God's work in history.
