Solomon, as king, is addressing the assembly of Israel, highlighting the importance of the occasion. The act of speaking in this context is significant, as it reflects the role of the king as both a political and spiritual leader.<p><b>&#8220;Blessed be the LORD,</b><br>The phrase "Blessed be the LORD" is a common expression of praise and worship in the Old Testament. It acknowledges God's sovereignty and goodness. This blessing is a form of doxology, a short hymn of praises to God, which is a recurring theme in the Psalms and other parts of Scripture.<p><b>the God of Israel,</b><br>This title emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It reflects the unique identity of Israel as God's chosen people, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament. The phrase underscores the monotheistic belief in Yahweh as the one true God, distinct from the gods of surrounding nations.<p><b>who has fulfilled with His own hand</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's active involvement in the fulfillment of His promises. The imagery of God's "hand" suggests His power and direct action in history. It connects to other biblical passages where God's hand is depicted as mighty and capable of delivering His people, such as in Exodus during the deliverance from Egypt.<p><b>what He spoke with His mouth</b><br>This phrase underscores the faithfulness of God in keeping His word. It reflects the biblical theme that God's spoken word is powerful and effective, as seen in the creation narrative in Genesis. The reliability of God's promises is a central tenet of biblical theology.<p><b>to my father David,</b><br>This reference to David connects Solomon's actions to the Davidic Covenant, where God promised David that his descendants would rule Israel. It highlights the continuity of God's plan through the generations. David is a key figure in biblical history, and his relationship with God is foundational for understanding the messianic prophecies that point to Jesus Christ.<p><b>saying,</b><br>The use of "saying" introduces a direct quotation, which in the biblical context often signifies the importance and authority of the words that follow. It prepares the reader for the specific promise or prophecy that God made, which in this case relates to the establishment of Solomon's temple and the continuation of David's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem.

He publicly magnifies God&#8217;s character before the assembled nation, echoing the pattern of praise in <a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1&#8211;2</a> and <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a>. By blessing the LORD first, Solomon teaches that all proper understanding of God&#8217;s works begins with adoration. Cross reference: <a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>, where David continually blesses the LORD in every circumstance; <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, where heavenly beings do the same, showing praise is the fitting response on earth and in heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the God of Israel</b><p>Calling Him &#8220;the God of Israel&#8221; anchors the moment in covenant. This is not a generic deity but the One who chose, delivered, and covenanted with Abraham&#8217;s offspring (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>). Solomon&#8217;s words remind the people that the temple dedication is the next chapter in a long, unbroken story of God keeping covenant promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>; <a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1</a>). The title underscores both intimacy&#8212;He is &#8220;our&#8221; God&#8212;and exclusivity&#8212;He alone is worthy (<a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who has fulfilled with His own hand</b><p>God&#8217;s &#8220;own hand&#8221; stresses personal action. He is no distant architect; He actively completed what He designed (<a href="/1_kings/8-24.htm">1 Kings 8:24</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>). The finished temple stands as tangible proof that the same hand that delivered Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3, 14</a>) still guides their destiny.<p>&#8226; Fulfillment is visible: the cedar beams, the gold overlay, the glory cloud.<p>&#8226; Fulfillment is precise: exactly as promised to David (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>This comforts believers today that God&#8217;s hand is just as involved in fulfilling every promise in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what He spoke with His mouth</b><p>God&#8217;s speech is never idle; His Word accomplishes what it declares (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). By stressing &#8220;with His mouth,&#8221; Solomon links the spoken promise to the executed deed, proving verbal revelation is completely reliable (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). Scripture&#8217;s authority stands because the God who speaks is the God who acts. See also <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17&#8211;18</a>, where God&#8217;s unchangeable purpose and oath give strong encouragement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to my father David, saying</b><p>The promise traces back to <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;13</a>, where God pledged a house and throne to David&#8217;s line. Solomon now experiences the partial fulfillment&#8212;building the temple&#8212;and points forward to the ultimate Son of David, the Messiah (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promises span generations (<a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Each fulfillment builds confidence for the next (<a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32&#8211;33</a>).<p>Solomon links past, present, and future in one continuous testimony of divine faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/6-4.htm">2 Chronicles 6:4</a> proclaims that the God who speaks is the God who acts. Solomon blesses the covenant LORD, identifies Him as Israel&#8217;s unique God, celebrates His hands-on fulfillment of every promise, and roots the moment in the everlasting covenant with David. The verse invites believers to trust every word of Scripture as certain, because the same faithful God still speaks and still brings His purposes to completion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Who hath with his hands fulfilled . . .
