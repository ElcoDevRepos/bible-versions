Her role as a female prophet is significant, as it highlights the presence and influence of women in spiritual leadership in ancient Israel. Huldah's authority was recognized by the king's officials, indicating her respected status. This moment occurs during a time of religious reform, as King Josiah sought to restore true worship in Judah. The officials sought Huldah's counsel after discovering the Book of the Law in the temple, underscoring the importance of prophetic guidance in interpreting God's will.<p><b>This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the divine authority behind Huldah's message. It is a common prophetic formula that asserts the message is not of human origin but from Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. This underscores the continuity of God's communication with His people through prophets. The use of "the God of Israel" reaffirms the special relationship between God and the nation, reminding the people of their identity and covenant obligations. This phrase connects to other prophetic declarations throughout the Old Testament, where prophets often begin their messages with similar affirmations of divine authority.<p><b>Tell the man who sent you</b><br>The "man" referred to here is King Josiah, who had sent his officials to inquire of the Lord. This phrase indicates the direct and personal nature of God's communication through the prophetess. It reflects the biblical principle that God speaks to leaders and holds them accountable for their actions. Josiah's initiative to seek God's guidance demonstrates his humility and desire to lead according to divine will. This inquiry is part of a broader narrative of Josiah's reforms, which included the removal of idolatry and the restoration of temple worship, aligning with the covenantal expectations outlined in the rediscovered Book of the Law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/huldah_the_prophetess.htm">Huldah the Prophetess</a></b><br>A respected prophetess in Jerusalem during the reign of King Josiah.

This quick response reminds us of Isaiah&#8217;s readiness in <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a> and Samuel&#8217;s in <a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says</b><p>With the familiar prophetic formula &#8220;Thus says the LORD,&#8221; Huldah anchors her words in the absolute authority of God.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that Scripture&#8217;s message is God-breathed (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) and carries covenantal weight, the same Lord who spoke at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling Him &#8220;the God of Israel&#8221; ties Josiah and the nation back to their identity as God&#8217;s chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>), confronting them with covenant responsibilities (<a href="/leviticus/26-9.htm">Leviticus 26:9-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Every genuine prophetic word points beyond the messenger to the Lord Himself, paralleling Jeremiah&#8217;s commission: &#8220;Behold, I have put My words in your mouth&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell the man who sent you</b><p>God singles out Josiah not by his royal title but simply as &#8220;the man,&#8221; stressing personal accountability before the Almighty.<p>&#8226; Titles and positions fade in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/job/34-19.htm">Job 34:19</a>); obedience matters more than rank.<p>&#8226; The wording anticipates Nathan&#8217;s confrontation of David&#8212;&#8220;You are the man!&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>)&#8212;showing how God addresses leaders directly when national destiny is at stake.<p>&#8226; Though Josiah sought guidance humbly (2 Chron 34:21), God&#8217;s message will still be firm and searching, similar to the word Jeremiah delivered to King Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The instruction &#8220;tell&#8221; emphasizes faithful transmission.
