Hiram, king of Tyre, was an ally of David, and Tyre was known for its skilled craftsmen and abundant resources, particularly cedar wood. This alliance reflects the political and economic strategies of the time, where neighboring kingdoms often formed partnerships for mutual benefit. The relationship between Israel and Tyre is significant, as it shows the interconnectedness of ancient Near Eastern politics and trade.<p><b>Do for me as you did for my father David:</b><br>Solomon is requesting the same favor that Hiram extended to David, which indicates a continuation of the covenantal friendship between the two nations. This request underscores the importance of maintaining alliances and the respect for past agreements. It also highlights Solomon's desire to honor his father's legacy and to build upon the foundation David laid. This continuity is crucial for the stability and prosperity of Solomon's reign.<p><b>when you sent him cedars to build himself a house to live in:</b><br>The "house" refers to David's palace, which was constructed with the high-quality cedar wood from Lebanon, a region under Hiram's control. Cedar was prized in the ancient world for its durability and pleasant aroma, making it a symbol of wealth and prestige. This phrase not only emphasizes the material wealth and architectural advancements of the time but also foreshadows Solomon's own building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem. The use of cedar in these constructions is a testament to the craftsmanship and resources of Tyre, as well as the importance of the Temple as a dwelling place for God, paralleling the "house" built for David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom and for building the First Temple in Jerusalem.

Whether the Tyrian name <span class= "ital">Sir?mos</span> (Herod. vii. 98) is another form of Hiram, as Bertheau supposes, is more than doubtful. It is interesting to find that the king of Tyre bore this name in the time of Tiglath-pileser II., to whom he paid tribute (B.C. 738), along with Menahem of Samaria. (Assyr. <span class= "ital">Hi-ru-um-mu,</span> to which the <span class= "ital">Hirom</span> of <a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm" title="So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.">1Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-18.htm" title="And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.">1Kings 5:18</a> comes very near.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Huram</span>.

The Septuagint write the name <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>; the Alexandrian, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Hiram.</span> The name of Hiram's father was Abibaal. Hiram himself began to reign, according to Menander, when nineteen years of age, reigned thirty-four years (B.C. 1023-990), and died therefore at the age of fifty-three. Of Hiram and his reign in Tyre very little is known beyond what is so familiar to us from the Bible history of David and Solomon. The city of Tyre is among the most ancient. Though it is not mentioned in Homer, yet the Sidonians, who lived in such close connection with the Tyrians, are mentioned there ('Iliad.,' 6:290; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:84; 22:424), whilst Virgil calls Tyre the Sidonian city, Sidon being twenty miles distant ('AEn.,' 1:12, 677; 4:545). The modern name of Tyre is <span class="accented">Sur.</span> The city was situate on the east coast of the Mediterranean, in Phoenicia, about seventy-four geographical miles north of Joppa, while the road distance from Joppa to Jerusalem was thirty-two miles. The first Bible mention of Tyre is in <a href="/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>. After that the more characteristic mentions of it are <a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>, with all its parallels; 2 Samuel 24:7; <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1, 7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/26-2.htm">Ezekiel 26:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-1.htm">Ezekiel 27:1-8</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-2.htm">Zechariah 9:2, 3</a>. Tyre was celebrated for its working in copper and brass, and by no means only for its cedar and timber felling. The good terms and intimacy subsisting between Solomon and the King of Tyre speak themselves very plainly in Bible history, without leaving us dependent on doubtful history, or tales of such as Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:05. &sect; 3; 'Contra Apion,' 1:17). For the timber, metals, workmen, given by Hiram to Solomon, Solomon gave to Hiram corn and oil, ceded to him some cities, and the use of some ports on the Red Sea (<a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-14, 25-28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21-23</a>.
