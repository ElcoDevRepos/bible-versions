The eighteenth year of his reign is particularly important because it marks a period of spiritual renewal and national reform. During this time, Josiah ordered the repair of the Temple, which led to the discovery of the Book of the Law. This discovery prompted a nationwide return to the covenant with God. The eighteenth year is also significant because it aligns with the prophetic timeline, as Josiah's reforms were a fulfillment of earlier prophecies about the restoration of true worship in Judah.<p><b>this Passover was observed</b><br>The Passover celebration in Josiah's eighteenth year was a monumental event, as it was conducted according to the ancient prescriptions found in the Book of the Law. This observance was not just a religious ritual but a national recommitment to the covenant with God. It was the most significant Passover since the days of Samuel the prophet, highlighting its importance in the history of Israel. The Passover is a type of Christ, symbolizing deliverance and redemption, pointing forward to Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb. This observance under Josiah's leadership was a return to the foundational aspects of Israel's faith and identity, emphasizing obedience to God's commands and the centrality of worship in the life of the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who reigned from approximately 640 to 609 BC.

Compare <a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3 and 23</a>:23, which repeat this same dating, showing the chronicler and the writer of Kings in full agreement.<p>&#8226; Josiah was only twenty-six (he began at eight, 2 Chron 34:1), so the verse highlights youthful zeal that matures into decisive action for God.<p>&#8226; Earlier benchmarks matter: in his eighth year he &#8220;began to seek the God of his father David&#8221; (2 Chron 34:3), and in his twelfth year he purged Judah of idols (2 Chron 34:3-7). By the eighteenth year, reform blossoms into worship.<p>&#8226; The timing also fulfills long-standing prophecy. Centuries earlier an unnamed man of God foretold that &#8220;a son named Josiah&#8221; would rise to cleanse the land (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>). The dating anchors that fulfillment in verifiable history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of Josiah&#8217;s reign</b><p>&#8226; The focus stays on the covenantal king whom God raised up just before impending judgment on Judah. His reign is a final bright flash of faithfulness before exile (<a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Josiah models leadership that is Scripture-driven; after the Law was found, he &#8220;made a covenant before the LORD&#8221; (2 Chron 34:31). This Passover embodies that covenant renewal.<p>&#8226; Cross reference <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>, which charges kings to read the Law daily. Josiah&#8217;s reign shows what happens when a ruler actually does.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This Passover</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;This&#8221; points back to the detailed description in 2 Chron 35:1-18. The celebration followed every Mosaic specification&#8212;slaughtered at twilight (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>), priests in their posts (2 Chron 35:2), Levites distributing portions (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 18 notes that no Passover like it had been kept since Samuel&#8217;s day, surpassing even Hezekiah&#8217;s earlier effort (2 Chron 30). The chronicler wants readers to feel the uniqueness and thoroughness of the event.<p>&#8226; The Passover commemorates redemption from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>). By reviving it, Josiah re-anchors the nation in its foundational salvation story, inviting hearts back to the LORD who saves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was observed</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underscores completion&#8212;intent turned into obedience. They didn&#8217;t just plan; they acted. See <a href="/john/13-17.htm">John 13:17</a>, &#8220;If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Corporate obedience matters. Priests, Levites, rulers, and common people each fulfilled their roles (2 Chron 35:10-15). Worship is never spectator only; everyone participates.<p>&#8226; The successful observance validates Josiah&#8217;s reforms: the temple is restored (2 Chron 34:8-13), the Word is honored (34:14-33), and worship is now functioning as God prescribed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/35-19.htm">2 Chronicles 35:19</a> is more than a date stamp; it testifies that in the precise eighteenth year of Josiah&#8217;s reign, a uniquely faithful Passover really happened. By anchoring the event in time, spotlighting Josiah&#8217;s Scripture-shaped rule, highlighting the exceptional nature of &#8220;this Passover,&#8221; and celebrating that it &#8220;was observed&#8221; exactly as God commanded, the verse invites us to trust Scripture&#8217;s accuracy, value timely obedience, and remember that true renewal always culminates in wholehearted worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">In the eighteenth year.</span>--<a href="/2_kings/23-23.htm" title="But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was held to the LORD in Jerusalem.">2Kings 23:23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Kept.</span>--<span class= "ital">Made</span> (<span class= "ital">na'as?h</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> For the date, comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/34-8.htm" title="Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.">2Chronicles 34:8</a>.
