This phrase emphasizes a return to the worship of Yahweh, the God of Israel, as opposed to the idolatrous practices that were prevalent in the northern kingdom of Israel. Seeking God implies a deliberate and earnest pursuit of a relationship with Him, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This pursuit often involved prayer, worship, and adherence to the Law. The phrase also highlights the importance of generational faithfulness, as Jehoshaphat follows the example set by his father, Asa, who also sought to reform Judah's religious practices.<p><b>and walked by His commandments</b><br>Walking by God's commandments indicates a lifestyle of obedience and adherence to the laws given to Moses. This phrase suggests that Jehoshaphat not only sought God but also lived according to His statutes, which included moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. This obedience is a key theme in the Deuteronomic history, where blessings are associated with following God's commandments. Jehoshaphat's reign is marked by religious reforms and efforts to educate the people in the Law, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7-9</a>, where he sends officials to teach the Book of the Law throughout Judah.<p><b>rather than the practices of Israel</b><br>The practices of Israel refer to the idolatrous and syncretistic worship that characterized the northern kingdom under kings like Jeroboam and Ahab. These practices included the worship of Baal and the golden calves set up by Jeroboam. By contrasting Judah's adherence to God's commandments with Israel's practices, the text underscores the spiritual and moral decline of the northern kingdom. Jehoshaphat's rejection of these practices signifies a commitment to pure worship and a desire to distinguish Judah from the apostasy of Israel. This distinction is crucial in the narrative of the divided kingdom, where Judah is often portrayed as more faithful to God than Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is the central figure in this passage.
