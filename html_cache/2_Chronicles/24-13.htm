The laborers were likely skilled craftsmen, possibly Levites, who were dedicated to restoring the temple. This reflects the biblical principle of working wholeheartedly as unto the Lord (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). The labor here is reminiscent of the construction of the tabernacle in Exodus, where skilled artisans were filled with the Spirit of God to complete the work (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>).<p><b>and in their hands the repair work progressed.</b><br>The progress of the repair work signifies the effective and efficient efforts of the workers. This can be seen as a fulfillment of King Joash's commitment to restore the temple, which had fallen into disrepair due to neglect and misuse during the reigns of previous kings. The phrase underscores the importance of faithful stewardship and the restoration of worship practices. It also parallels the rebuilding efforts seen in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, where the people worked together to restore Jerusalem and its temple.<p><b>They restored the house of God according to its specifications,</b><br>Restoring the temple "according to its specifications" indicates adherence to the original design given by God, as seen in the detailed instructions provided to Solomon (1 Kings 6). This reflects the importance of following divine instructions and maintaining the sanctity of worship spaces. The restoration was not just a physical renewal but also a spiritual one, aligning with the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who came to fulfill the law and restore the relationship between God and humanity (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>and they reinforced it.</b><br>Reinforcing the temple suggests strengthening and fortifying the structure to ensure its longevity and continued use for worship. This action symbolizes the need for spiritual reinforcement in the lives of believers, emphasizing the importance of a strong foundation in faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>). The reinforcement of the temple can also be seen as a prophetic act pointing to the eternal and unshakeable kingdom established by Christ (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the repair of the temple.
