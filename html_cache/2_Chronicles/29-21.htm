The use of seven animals for each type signifies a complete and perfect offering to God. Bulls, rams, lambs, and goats were common sacrificial animals in Israelite worship, each representing different aspects of atonement and dedication. Bulls were often used for sin offerings, rams for burnt offerings, lambs for daily sacrifices, and goats for sin offerings, particularly on the Day of Atonement.<p><b>as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah</b><br>The sin offering was a crucial part of the sacrificial system, symbolizing atonement and purification from sin. Offering these sacrifices for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah indicates a comprehensive act of repentance and dedication. The kingdom represents the political and social structure, the sanctuary signifies the religious and spiritual center, and Judah denotes the people and their land. This reflects a holistic approach to seeking God's forgiveness and favor.<p><b>And the king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron</b><br>The priests, as descendants of Aaron, were the only ones authorized to perform sacrifices, emphasizing the importance of adhering to God's established order. The king's command highlights the role of leadership in guiding the nation back to proper worship. This act of obedience to God's law underscores the importance of spiritual leadership and the need for national repentance and renewal.<p><b>to offer them on the altar of the LORD</b><br>The altar of the LORD was the designated place for sacrifices, symbolizing God's presence and the means by which the Israelites could approach Him. Offering sacrifices on the altar was an act of worship and obedience, acknowledging God's holiness and the need for atonement. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of sacrifice as a means of reconciliation with God, ultimately pointing to Jesus Christ as the perfect and final sacrifice for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and the cleansing of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests,_the_descendants_of_aaron.htm">Priests, the descendants of Aaron</a></b><br>The Levitical priests responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple rituals.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_the_lord.htm">The Altar of the LORD</a></b><br>The sacred place where sacrifices were offered to God, symbolizing atonement and worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom,_the_sanctuary,_and_judah.htm">The Kingdom, the Sanctuary, and Judah</a></b><br>Representing the political, religious, and tribal aspects of the nation that required purification and dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial ritual intended to atone for the sins of the people, restoring their relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance_and_atonement.htm">The Importance of Repentance and Atonement</a></b><br>Hezekiah's actions highlight the necessity of repentance and atonement for sin.

Some think (as, for instance, Canon Rawlinson) that they were sin offering, as the account of the offering of them (ver. 22) takes priority for them over the he-goats; others (as Bertheau, Professor J. G. Murphy, etc.), that they were certainly burnt offering. It scarcely appears as though much stress can be laid upon what is apparently the chief reason of Canon Rawlinson's opinion, in face of the immediate language of the last sentence of our ver. 24, "for the king commended the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel." The fact of no mention of burnt offering in our present verse, and of the natural construction of the description, "for a sin offering for the kingdom," etc., as applying to <span class="accented">all</span> that had preceded, seems the better argument, and all that is necessary, unless something moderately decisive be forthcoming to rebut it. The solution of all, however, is probably to our hand in <a href="/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, which is a very close and significant parallel to our present verse. The first mention of the sacrifice of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, or "young bullocks" is found in <a href="/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and afterwards in <a href="/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1, 3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, etc.; Leviticus 8:2, 14, etc. The first mention of the sacrifice of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>; and, after, <a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15-18, 19-21</a>, etc.; <a href="/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2, 22</a>, etc. The first mention of the sacrifices of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-7</a>, and, after, <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>, etc. The first mention of the sacrifice of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is the present passage; and, after, <a href="/ezra/8-25.htm">Ezra 8:25</a>.
