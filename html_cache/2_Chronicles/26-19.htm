His reign was marked by military success and prosperity, but his pride led to his downfall. The censer, a vessel used for burning incense, was typically used by priests, not kings. The act of offering incense was a priestly duty, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>, and was reserved for the descendants of Aaron. Uzziah's attempt to perform this ritual reflects a significant overstepping of his kingly authority, highlighting his pride and disregard for God's established order.<p><b>was enraged</b><br>Uzziah's anger reveals his unwillingness to accept correction and his hardened heart. The priests, led by Azariah, confronted him, reminding him that his actions were not lawful. His rage can be seen as a manifestation of his pride and arrogance, which are often cautioned against in Proverbs (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This moment serves as a warning against the dangers of pride and the importance of humility before God.<p><b>But while he raged against the priests in their presence</b><br>The confrontation between Uzziah and the priests took place in the temple, a sacred space where God's presence was uniquely manifest. The priests, who were the rightful ministers of the temple, stood firm in their duty to uphold God's law. This scene underscores the tension between Uzziah's kingly authority and the divine authority represented by the priests. It also illustrates the principle that no earthly power is above God's law.<p><b>in the house of the LORD before the altar of incense</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. The altar of incense was located in the Holy Place, just outside the Holy of Holies, and was used for burning incense as a symbol of prayer and intercession (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>). Uzziah's presence here, performing a priestly function, was a direct violation of the sacred space and duties assigned by God.<p><b>leprosy broke out on his forehead</b><br>Leprosy in the Bible is often associated with sin and impurity. The sudden outbreak of leprosy on Uzziah's forehead was a divine judgment and a visible sign of his transgression. According to Levitical law, leprosy rendered a person ceremonially unclean and required them to live outside the camp (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>). This punishment not only removed Uzziah from the temple but also from his royal duties, symbolizing the consequences of pride and disobedience. The forehead, being a prominent and visible part of the body, signifies the public nature of his sin and its consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned for 52 years.
