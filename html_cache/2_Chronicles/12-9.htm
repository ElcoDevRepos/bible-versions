His attack on Jerusalem occurred around 926 BC, during the reign of Rehoboam, Solomon's son. This event is significant as it marks the first time Jerusalem was invaded since the establishment of the united monarchy under David and Solomon. The attack is a fulfillment of the prophecy given by the prophet Shemaiah, who warned Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah that their abandonment of God's law would lead to their subjugation (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5</a>). Shishak's campaign is also recorded in Egyptian records, notably on the Bubastite Portal at Karnak, which lists the cities he conquered.<p><b>and seized the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the royal palace.</b><br>The treasures of the house of the LORD refer to the wealth accumulated in the Temple built by Solomon, which was renowned for its opulence and splendor. The royal palace, similarly, was a symbol of the Davidic dynasty's prosperity and God's blessing. The loss of these treasures signifies a divine judgment on Judah for their unfaithfulness. This event serves as a reminder of the conditional nature of God's covenant with Israel, where blessings were contingent upon obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>).<p><b>He took everything,</b><br>The phrase "He took everything" underscores the totality of the plunder. It indicates not only a physical loss but also a spiritual and moral defeat for Judah. The comprehensive nature of the plundering reflects the severity of God's judgment and the vulnerability of a nation that has turned away from Him. This act of taking everything can be seen as a reversal of the prosperity and peace that characterized Solomon's reign, highlighting the consequences of forsaking God's commandments.<p><b>including the gold shields that Solomon had made.</b><br>The gold shields were part of the extensive wealth and military splendor of Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16-17</a>). They symbolized strength, protection, and divine favor. Their loss is particularly poignant, as it represents the stripping away of the glory and security that once defined the kingdom. The shields' removal can be seen as a type of Christ, who is our shield and protector (<a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>). The absence of these shields foreshadows the need for a greater, more enduring protection found in Jesus Christ, who offers spiritual security and eternal salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shishak,_king_of_egypt.htm">Shishak, King of Egypt</a></b><br>Shishak was the Pharaoh of Egypt who invaded Judah during the reign of Rehoboam.
