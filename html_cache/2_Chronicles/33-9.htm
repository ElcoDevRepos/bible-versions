His leadership marked a significant departure from his father's reforms, as he reintroduced idolatry and pagan practices. The phrase "led the people astray" indicates a deliberate turning away from the worship of Yahweh to embrace the religious customs of surrounding nations. This apostasy included the worship of Baal, Asherah, and celestial bodies, as well as the practice of child sacrifice. Manasseh's influence was profound, as he not only engaged in these practices himself but also encouraged the people of Judah and Jerusalem to follow suit, leading them into spiritual and moral decline.<p><b>so that they did greater evil than the nations</b><br>The comparison to "the nations" refers to the Canaanite peoples whom God had driven out before the Israelites. These nations were known for their detestable practices, which included idolatry, child sacrifice, and various forms of immorality. The text suggests that Judah's sins under Manasseh's rule surpassed even these abominations. This highlights the severity of Judah's apostasy, as they had the Law and the prophets to guide them, yet chose to engage in practices that were explicitly condemned by God. The phrase underscores the depth of their rebellion and the extent to which they had abandoned their covenantal relationship with God.<p><b>that the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites</b><br>This refers to the divine judgment executed upon the Canaanite nations during the conquest of the Promised Land under Joshua. The destruction of these nations was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and a demonstration of His holiness and justice. The Israelites were commanded to destroy these nations to prevent the corruption of their own worship and practices. The fact that Judah's actions under Manasseh were worse than those of the Canaanites serves as a stark warning of the consequences of forsaking God's commandments. It also foreshadows the impending judgment that would come upon Judah, as God would not tolerate such rebellion indefinitely. This phrase serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the necessity of faithfulness to God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah, son of Hezekiah, known for his idolatrous practices and leading the nation into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with Jerusalem as its capital.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, central to Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who had delivered Israel from Egypt and given them the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Canaanite nations that God had driven out before Israel due to their wickedness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_leadership.htm">The Consequences of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders have a profound impact on the spiritual direction of their people.
