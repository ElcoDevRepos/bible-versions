Nighttime appearances are significant in the Bible, often symbolizing revelation and divine intervention (e.g., <a href="/genesis/46-2.htm">Genesis 46:2</a>, <a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9</a>). The LORD's appearance underscores the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>and said to him:</b><br>God's direct communication with Solomon highlights the king's role as a mediator between God and Israel. This divine dialogue is reminiscent of God's conversations with other key figures like Moses and David, establishing continuity in God's covenantal relationship with His people.<p><b>&#8220;I have heard your prayer</b><br>This assurance from God confirms that Solomon's dedication of the temple and his preceding prayer (2 Chronicles 6) were accepted. It reflects the biblical theme that God listens to the prayers of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>) and responds to sincere petitions.<p><b>and have chosen this place for Myself</b><br>God's choice of the temple in Jerusalem as His dwelling place signifies His presence among His people. This selection fulfills the promise made to David regarding a permanent house for God's name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<p><b>as a house of sacrifice.</b><br>The temple's primary function as a place of sacrifice underscores the importance of atonement and worship in Israel's relationship with God. Sacrifices were central to the covenant, symbolizing repentance and reconciliation.
