Historically, the Assyrians were known for their military prowess and their practice of deporting conquered peoples, which often included the destruction of local religious sites. The phrase "devoted to destruction" echoes the biblical concept of herem, where certain things were set apart for destruction as an offering to God (see <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-21</a>). This highlights the Assyrian belief that their victories were sanctioned by their deities. Theologically, this sets the stage for a confrontation between the God of Israel and the gods of the nations, reminiscent of Elijah's challenge to the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>.<p><b>has been able to deliver his people from my hand?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores Sennacherib's confidence in his military conquests and the perceived impotence of other nations' gods. Historically, the Assyrians had a long record of successful campaigns, which likely contributed to Sennacherib's hubris. The phrase "from my hand" suggests a personal claim to power and control, a common theme in ancient Near Eastern royal propaganda. Biblically, this sets up a contrast with the God of Israel, who is often depicted as a deliverer of His people (see <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). This question challenges the faith of the Israelites and serves as a test of their trust in God's power to save.<p><b>How then can your God deliver you from my hand?</b><br>This challenge directly questions the power and sovereignty of the God of Israel. It reflects a common ancient Near Eastern belief that the gods of a nation were only as powerful as the nation itself. Sennacherib's taunt is not just against the people of Judah but against their God, implying that He is no different from the defeated gods of other nations. This sets the stage for a divine demonstration of power, as seen in the subsequent deliverance of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-21.htm">2 Chronicles 32:21-22</a>). Theologically, this question foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's promise to save His people (see <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>, <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The challenge also echoes the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, where His divine authority and mission were questioned (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The Assyrian king who invaded Judah and laid siege to Jerusalem.
