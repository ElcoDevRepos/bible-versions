Throughout the Old Testament, prophets were sent by God to deliver His messages, often calling for repentance and warning of impending judgment. The mocking of these messengers reflects a hardened heart and a refusal to heed divine warnings. This behavior is reminiscent of the treatment of prophets like Jeremiah, who faced ridicule and persecution (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-8</a>). The rejection of God's messengers is a recurring theme, seen also in the New Testament with the rejection of Jesus and His apostles (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p><b>despising His words</b><br>Despising God's words indicates a deep-seated contempt for divine instruction and guidance. The words of God, delivered through the prophets, were meant to guide, correct, and lead the people back to righteousness. However, the people of Judah chose to ignore and belittle these words, demonstrating a lack of reverence and fear of the Lord. This attitude is contrasted with the biblical call to treasure God's word (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>) and to live by it (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>). The rejection of God's words ultimately leads to spiritual decay and judgment.<p><b>and scoffing at His prophets</b><br>Scoffing at the prophets signifies a dismissive and scornful attitude towards those who were chosen to convey God's messages. Prophets like Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah often faced opposition and ridicule from the very people they were sent to help. This scoffing is indicative of a broader cultural and spiritual decline, where the sacred is treated with disdain. The New Testament echoes this sentiment, warning that in the last days, scoffers will come, following their own desires (<a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3</a>).<p><b>until the wrath of the LORD against His people was stirred up</b><br>The phrase underscores the consequence of persistent disobedience and rebellion. God's wrath is not arbitrary but is a response to the continuous rejection of His covenant and commands. The stirring up of God's wrath is a theme seen throughout the Old Testament, where divine patience eventually gives way to judgment when repentance is absent. This is evident in the Babylonian exile, where Judah's persistent sin led to their downfall (<a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>). The concept of divine wrath serves as a sobering reminder of God's holiness and justice.<p><b>beyond remedy</b><br>This phrase indicates a point of no return, where the opportunity for repentance and restoration has been exhausted. The idea of being beyond remedy is a tragic outcome of persistent sin and rebellion. It reflects the severity of Judah's spiritual condition, where despite numerous warnings and opportunities to repent, they continued in their ways. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where the unpardonable sin is described as a blasphemy against the Holy Spirit (<a href="/mark/3-29.htm">Mark 3:29</a>). It serves as a warning of the dangers of hardening one's heart against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers_of_god.htm">Messengers of God</a></b><br>These are the prophets and leaders sent by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
