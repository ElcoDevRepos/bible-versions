In the context of the Old Testament, doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD often involves adherence to the Mosaic Law and the worship of Yahweh alone, rejecting idolatry. This phrase is used throughout the books of Kings and Chronicles to assess the kings of Israel and Judah, highlighting the importance of obedience to God. It reflects the Deuteronomic principle that obedience leads to blessing, while disobedience leads to judgment.<p><b>just as his father Amaziah had done</b><br>Amaziah, Uzziah's father, also began his reign by doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD, though not wholeheartedly (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>). This comparison suggests a continuation of a legacy of initial faithfulness to God, though Amaziah's later actions, such as idolatry after his victory over Edom, led to his downfall. The mention of Amaziah serves as a reminder of the potential pitfalls of not maintaining a steadfast commitment to God. It also underscores the biblical theme of generational influence, where the actions and faith of one generation can impact the next.
