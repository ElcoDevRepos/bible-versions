The temple had fallen into disrepair during the reigns of previous kings who had turned away from the worship of Yahweh.

Its discovery was significant because it had been neglected or lost during the reigns of previous kings who had led the nation into idolatry. The finding of the book led to a national religious reform and a renewed covenant with God, as described in the subsequent verses.<p><b>given by Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin and authority of the Law, as it was delivered through Moses, the great prophet and leader of Israel. The Law was central to the covenant relationship between God and His people, outlining the moral, ceremonial, and civil guidelines for living in accordance with God's will.

Restoring it reflected a desire to restore covenant faithfulness (compare 2 Chron 29:3&#8211;11 under Hezekiah).<p>- Just as giving flowed into God&#8217;s house, God was about to pour truth back out to His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD</b><p>- Amid the clutter, the high priest uncovered the scroll of Moses&#8217; Law&#8212;likely Genesis through Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24&#8211;26</a>).<p>- The discovery was not accidental; it was providential.
