Hiram was a Phoenician king who had a strong alliance with Solomon, providing materials and skilled labor for the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. This partnership reflects the broader theme of international cooperation and trade in the ancient Near East. The alliance also signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build the Temple, as Hiram's resources were crucial for this endeavor.<p><b>who brought gold from Ophir</b><br>Ophir is a region mentioned several times in the Bible, renowned for its wealth and fine gold. Its exact location remains uncertain, though it is often associated with areas in Arabia, East Africa, or India. The mention of Ophir underscores the extensive trade networks of the time and Solomon's wealth and wisdom in securing such valuable resources. This gold was used in the Temple, symbolizing the glory and splendor of God's dwelling place on earth.<p><b>also brought algum wood</b><br>Algum wood, also known as almug or sandalwood, was a rare and valuable material used in the construction of the Temple and Solomon's palace. Its mention indicates the luxurious and high-quality materials that were employed in these projects. The wood was likely used for musical instruments, pillars, and other decorative elements, enhancing the beauty and grandeur of the structures. This reflects the biblical theme of offering the best to God.<p><b>and precious stones</b><br>Precious stones were used extensively in the Temple's construction and decoration, symbolizing beauty, wealth, and divine favor. These stones were likely used in the priestly garments, the Temple's interior, and Solomon's palace. The use of such materials points to the heavenly reality that the Temple represented, as described in Revelation, where the New Jerusalem is adorned with precious stones. This connection emphasizes the idea of God's presence and glory being reflected in the earthly Temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>The king of Tyre, a friend and ally of King Solomon, who provided materials and skilled laborers for the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and the building of the First Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/ophir.htm">Ophir</a></b><br>A region famous for its wealth, particularly gold.

There are some slight indications pointing to this, and the meaning is perhaps that the terraces, balustrades, stairs (which possibly is the idea in the "ascent," ver. 4), pillars, etc., made of the wood which Hiram's and Solomon's servants had <span class="accented">formerly</span> brought with gold, were the artificial-work wonders which helped to astound the queen. <span class="cmt_word">Terraces to the house of the Lord, and to the king's palace</span>. These so rendered <span class="accented">terraces</span> were probably stairs, and, as already intimated, may have composed the "ascent" (ver. 4), and explain the mention of it in ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">The algum trees.</span> This is the Hebrew text order of the <span class="accented">lamed</span> and <span class="accented">gimel</span> alphabet characters, as the Authorized Version order in the parallel <span class="accented">almug</span> is also the order of its Hebrew. The tree is mentioned only six times - three times in Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10, 11</a>) and three times in Kings (<a href="/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11, 12</a>). Apparently this wood did grow in Lebanon (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>), though we think this not certain. Kimchi thinks it was the bukkum (Arabic word), which Europeans call Brazil wood, and which (Keil) was found in Ethiopia, as well as India. Some think it the sandal-wood of Malabar. Whatever it was, it no doubt was to be purchased at the emporium of Ophir. The intrinsic nature of the wood, and its intrinsically valuable nature, may easily be inferred from its use for the woodwork and sounding-board woodwork of musical instruments like the <span class="accented">harp</span> and <span class="accented">psaltery.</span> This fact would much incline to the view that the <span class="accented">red</span> sandal-wood is what is here called algum.
