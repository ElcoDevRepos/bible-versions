After the division of the united monarchy, these tribes were often estranged from the religious practices centered in Jerusalem. Their presence at this Passover indicates a significant moment of unity and spiritual renewal under King Hezekiah's reforms. Historically, these tribes were part of the northern kingdom, which had been conquered by Assyria, leading to a dispersion and loss of identity. Their involvement here suggests a remnant returning to the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written.</b><br>According to the Mosaic Law, specifically in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a> and <a href="/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>, participants in the Passover were required to be ceremonially clean. The failure to purify themselves before partaking in the Passover was a serious breach of the law. This situation underscores the tension between legalistic adherence to the law and the grace extended by God. It also reflects the challenges faced by those returning to proper worship after a period of neglect and apostasy.<p><b>But Hezekiah interceded for them,</b><br>Hezekiah's role as an intercessor is significant. It mirrors the priestly function of mediating between God and the people, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ as the great High Priest. Hezekiah's intercession reflects his leadership and concern for the spiritual well-being of the people, emphasizing the importance of prayer and advocacy in the life of a believer.<p><b>saying, &#8220;May the LORD, who is good, provide atonement for everyone&#8221;</b><br>This plea for atonement highlights the character of God as merciful and forgiving. The concept of atonement is central to the biblical narrative, pointing forward to the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ on the cross. Hezekiah's prayer acknowledges human imperfection and the need for divine grace. It also reflects the theological understanding that God's goodness and mercy can cover human shortcomings, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, including in the New Testament teachings on grace and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the proper worship of Yahweh, including the celebration of the Passover.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim,_manasseh,_issachar,_and_zebulun.htm">Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun</a></b><br>Tribes of Israel whose members participated in the Passover despite not having purified themselves according to the law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, which required participants to be ceremonially clean.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/purification.htm">Purification</a></b><br>The process required by the Mosaic Law for individuals to be considered clean and eligible to partake in religious ceremonies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_of_hezekiah.htm">Prayer of Hezekiah</a></b><br>Hezekiah's intercession for those who were not ceremonially clean, asking God to provide atonement for them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_worship.htm">The Heart of Worship</a></b><br>True worship is not just about external rituals but the condition of the heart.

This action seemed to violate explicit commandments (<a href="/numbers/9-13.htm">Numbers 9:13</a>). It underscores the tension between strict ceremonial compliance and the heart of worship that the Law was meant to cultivate (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Hezekiah interceded for them</b><p>The king did not dismiss God&#8217;s standards; he appealed to God&#8217;s grace within those standards. Like Moses interceding after the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and David pleading for mercy (<a href="/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>), Hezekiah stood between the people and potential judgment, modeling the priestly role intended for Israel&#8217;s leaders (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;May the LORD, who is good, provide atonement for everyone&#8221;</b><p>Hezekiah&#8217;s prayer rests on God&#8217;s unchanging goodness (<a href="/psalms/100-5.htm">Psalm 100:5</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). &#8220;Provide atonement&#8221; anticipates the once-for-all sacrifice fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>). God answered the prayer immediately&#8212;&#8220;the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-20.htm">2 Chronicles 30:20</a>). The incident teaches that God&#8217;s mercy does not abolish His law; it fulfills its ultimate purpose by pointing to a gracious atonement beyond human ritual (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/30-18.htm">2 Chronicles 30:18</a> reveals God&#8217;s heart to receive sincere worshipers even when they fall short of ceremonial perfection. Hezekiah&#8217;s intercession, grounded in God&#8217;s goodness, secured divine pardon for unpurified yet earnest pilgrims. The verse affirms that while God&#8217;s standards are absolute, His mercy is greater still, foreshadowing the perfect atonement later accomplished through Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">A multitude.</span>--<span class= "ital">Marbith</span> (2chron 96; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-29.htm" title="And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for till now the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.">1Chronicles 12:29</a>).
