This phrase highlights a pivotal moment where Hezekiah recognizes his arrogance and chooses humility. The act of humbling oneself is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with repentance and seeking God's favor (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). Hezekiah's humility is significant because it contrasts with his earlier pride, which is mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-25.htm">2 Chronicles 32:25</a>, where he did not respond appropriately to God's kindness. This act of humbling is a turning point, showing a return to dependence on God.<p><b>he and the people of Jerusalem&#8212;</b><br>The inclusion of the people of Jerusalem indicates a communal repentance. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a king's actions often set the tone for the nation. Hezekiah's leadership in humbling himself likely inspired the people to follow suit. This collective humility is reminiscent of other biblical instances where communal repentance leads to divine mercy, such as in the story of Jonah and Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-10</a>). It underscores the importance of both individual and corporate repentance in seeking God's forgiveness.<p><b>so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them&#8212;</b><br>The wrath of the LORD refers to divine judgment, which in the Old Testament often manifested as military defeat, famine, or other calamities. Hezekiah's humility averts this judgment, demonstrating the biblical principle that God is merciful to those who repent (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). This phrase also reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brings blessing and disobedience brings judgment (Deuteronomy 28). The avoidance of God's wrath here is a testament to His willingness to forgive and restore those who turn back to Him.<p><b>during the days of Hezekiah.</b><br>This temporal clause indicates that the reprieve from God's wrath was specific to Hezekiah's reign. It suggests that Hezekiah's leadership and the people's repentance had a lasting impact during his lifetime. However, it also implies that future generations would need to continue in faithfulness to maintain God's favor. This is a common theme in the history of Israel and Judah, where the faithfulness of one generation does not automatically ensure the same for the next (<a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>). The phrase serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for each generation to seek God earnestly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who reigned during a time of significant threat from the Assyrian empire.
