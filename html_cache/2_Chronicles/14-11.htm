This act of crying out signifies a deep, earnest plea for divine intervention. Asa's relationship with God is personal, as indicated by "his God," showing a covenantal bond. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking God in times of trouble, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>.<p><b>O LORD, there is no one besides You to help the powerless against the mighty:</b><br>Asa acknowledges God's unique ability to deliver and protect. This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and omnipotence, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The powerless versus the mighty highlights the biblical motif of God siding with the humble and oppressed, as seen in David's victory over Goliath (1 Samuel 17).<p><b>Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on You:</b><br>Asa's plea for help is rooted in trust and dependence on God. The phrase "we rely on You" underscores the faith of Judah in God's providence. This reliance is a central tenet of faith, echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which calls believers to trust in the Lord with all their heart.<p><b>and in Your name we have come against this multitude:</b><br>The battle is approached not in human strength but under the authority and power of God's name. This reflects the biblical understanding of acting in God's name as invoking His presence and power, similar to how David approached Goliath in the name of the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).<p><b>O LORD, You are our God:</b><br>This declaration reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and His people. It is a statement of identity and belonging, echoing the covenant language found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, where God promises to be their God.<p><b>Do not let a mere mortal prevail against You:</b><br>Asa's prayer concludes with a request for God to demonstrate His power over human forces. The phrase "mere mortal" contrasts human frailty with divine strength. This reflects the biblical theme of God's ultimate authority over creation, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23</a>, which speaks of God reducing rulers to nothing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The king of Judah who sought to follow the Lord and led his people in a time of religious reform and reliance on God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, over which Asa reigned, known for its fluctuating faithfulness to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zerah_the_cushite.htm">Zerah the Cushite</a></b><br>The leader of a vast army that came against Judah, representing a formidable threat.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whom Asa calls upon for deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The impending conflict between Judah and the Cushite army, highlighting the need for divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Asa's prayer is a model of complete reliance on God, acknowledging human weakness and divine strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_in_crisis.htm">Prayer in Crisis</a></b><br>In times of overwhelming challenges, turning to God in prayer should be our first response.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognizing that God is in control and can deliver us from any situation, no matter how dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Asa's faith was not passive; he actively sought God's help and led his people in His name.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_in_god's_name.htm">Victory in God's Name</a></b><br>True victory comes not from human might but through the power and authority of God's name.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_14_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 14:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Asa_s_prayer_shows_trust_in_God_s_power.htm">How does Asa's prayer in 2 Chronicles 14:11 demonstrate reliance on God's power?

A very plausible view is that of Kamphausen, who proposes to read <span class= "ital">la'cor</span> for <span class= "ital">la'zor</span> ("to retain strength" for "to help"), an expression which actually occurs at the end of the verse, and to render the whole: "Lord, it is not for any to retain (strength) with (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to withstand) Thee, whether strong or powerless." (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/13-20.htm" title="Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.">2Chronicles 13:20</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-14.htm" title="But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have we given you.">1Chronicles 29:14</a>). The Syriac paraphrases thus: "Thou art our Lord, the helper of thy people. When thou shalt deliver a great army into the hands of a few, then all the inhabitants of the world will know that we rightly trust in thee." This is much more like a Targum than a translation.

Probably the correcter rendering of our present Hebrew text would be, "It makes no difference with thee to help those whose strength is great or whose strength is nothing (between the much <span class="accented">even</span> to the none of strength)." Keil and Bertheau would translate "There is none beside thee." For another instance of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>, see <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6</a>; and comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/1-13.htm">2 Chronicles 1:13</a>. The prayer must be counted a model prayer to an omnipotent Deliverer. It consists of opening invocation and the instancing of what postulates the crowning Divine attribute as the broad foundation for argument; of invocation repeated, warmed to closer clinging by the appropriating "oar;" attended by the defining, though very universal petition, <span class="cmt_word">Help us</span>; and followed by the argument of the unbending fidelity of trusting dependence, For we rest <span class="cmt_word">on thee, and in thy Name we go against this multitude</span>; and, lastly, of invocation renewed or still determinedly sustained, pressed home by the clenching challenge of relationship and its correlative responsibility and presumable holy pride.
