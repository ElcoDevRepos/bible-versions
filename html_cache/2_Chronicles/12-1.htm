His reign marked the beginning of the divided kingdom, with Jeroboam ruling over the northern tribes of Israel. Rehoboam's sovereignty was established after a tumultuous start, including the revolt of the northern tribes. The term "established" indicates a period of consolidation and stability in his rule, suggesting that he had secured his position and authority over Judah. This period of stability might have led to complacency, as often seen in biblical narratives where leaders turn away from God after achieving power.<p><b>he and all Israel with him forsook the Law of the LORD</b><br>The phrase "forsook the Law of the LORD" indicates a deliberate turning away from the commandments and statutes given by God to Israel. This forsaking is not just a personal failing of Rehoboam but involves "all Israel with him," suggesting a national apostasy. The Law of the LORD refers to the Mosaic Law, which was central to Israel's covenant relationship with God. This forsaking would have included neglecting the worship of Yahweh, possibly turning to idolatry, and failing to uphold justice and righteousness as prescribed in the Law. This act of forsaking is a recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah, often leading to divine judgment. It also highlights the importance of leadership in guiding the spiritual direction of a nation. The forsaking of the Law contrasts with the ideal kingship exemplified by David, who, despite his failings, sought to follow God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, Rehoboam's reign is marked by a division of the kingdom and spiritual decline.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of the united kingdom under David and Solomon, but here it specifically refers to the southern kingdom of Judah under Rehoboam's rule.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/forsaking_the_law.htm">Forsaking the Law</a></b><br>This event marks a turning point where Rehoboam and the people of Judah abandon the commandments and statutes given by God, leading to spiritual and national consequences.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_complacency.htm">The Danger of Complacency</a></b><br>Once Rehoboam felt secure, he turned away from God.
