Historically, after the division of the united monarchy, these tribes were often associated with idolatry and strayed from the worship of Yahweh. The mention of these tribes indicates a remnant of faithfulness among them, despite the prevailing apostasy. This remnant theme is consistent throughout Scripture, where God preserves a faithful group even in times of widespread unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>). The inclusion of these tribes also signifies the beginning of a reunification of the divided kingdom under a common worship of God, foreshadowing the ultimate unity found in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>humbled themselves</b><br>Humility is a recurring biblical theme, often associated with repentance and a return to God (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The act of humbling oneself is a prerequisite for receiving God's grace and favor (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a>, this humility is demonstrated by the willingness of individuals from these tribes to acknowledge their need for God and to seek Him in Jerusalem, despite the political and religious pressures of their own kingdom. This act of humility can be seen as a type of the repentance that Jesus calls for in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>).<p><b>and came to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the city chosen by God for His temple, represents the center of true worship and the presence of God (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>). The pilgrimage to Jerusalem signifies a return to the proper worship of Yahweh, as prescribed in the Law of Moses. This journey is not merely geographical but also spiritual, symbolizing a return to covenant faithfulness. The act of coming to Jerusalem prefigures the gathering of all nations to worship God in the eschatological vision of the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>) and finds its ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asher.htm">Asher</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, located in the northern kingdom.

Most of the northern Israelites had just laughed Hezekiah&#8217;s messengers to scorn (2 Chron 30:10), but&#8212;nevertheless&#8212;God always keeps a remnant. We&#8217;re reminded of Elijah&#8217;s day when the Lord reserved 7,000 who had not bowed to Baal (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>). The verse signals hope: national rebellion never cancels divine mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun</b><p>These tribes lay in the former northern kingdom, far from Judah&#8217;s temple and deep in idolatry since Jeroboam set up the golden calves (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). That background makes their response striking.<p>&#8226; Asher bordered Phoenicia, often influenced by Gentile practices (<a href="/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Manasseh was split across the Jordan, vulnerable to Assyrian pressure (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Zebulun sat near Galilee, later called &#8220;Galilee of the nations&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>).<p>Their presence proves that no region is too compromised for God to reach. Like the Ninevites who repented at Jonah&#8217;s preaching (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>), these northerners still heard the Lord&#8217;s call.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Humbled themselves</b><p>Repentance begins in the heart. Instead of defending tradition or convenience, they bowed to God&#8217;s Word delivered through King Hezekiah (2 Chron 30:6-9). Scripture repeats this principle:<p>&#8226; &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;If My people&#8230; humble themselves and pray&#8230; then I will hear&#8221; (2 Chron 7:14).<p>Humility is the doorway to restoration, whether for a wandering tribe or an individual believer today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came to Jerusalem</b><p>They didn&#8217;t stop at good intentions; they acted. Coming to Jerusalem meant:<p>&#8226; Obeying the covenant command to celebrate Passover at the chosen place (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Crossing political lines&#8212;leaving the security of their own towns to worship in a kingdom they once opposed.<p>&#8226; Trusting God&#8217;s promise of protection, much like pilgrims in <a href="/bsb/psalms/122.htm">Psalm 122</a> who rejoiced to go to the house of the Lord.<p>The trip prefigures the greater gathering fulfilled in Christ: &#8220;You have come to Mount Zion&#8230; the city of the living God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11</a> highlights a faithful minority who refused to follow the crowd. Against a backdrop of mockery, these Israelites from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled their hearts, obeyed God&#8217;s invitation, and traveled to Jerusalem for Passover. The verse assures us that when people respond to God&#8217;s Word with humility and action, He welcomes them, preserves a remnant, and weaves their obedience into His redemptive story.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Nevertheless divers of Asher.</span>--<span class= "ital">But some men of Asher.</span>--Besides these from Asher, Manasseh, Zebulun, <a href="/2_chronicles/30-18.htm" title="For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.
