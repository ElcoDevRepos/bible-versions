This ensured that the Ark, representing God's presence, was handled with reverence and according to divine instruction. The poles being extended signifies the Ark's readiness for movement, symbolizing God's guidance and presence with His people.<p><b>that their ends were visible from in front of the inner sanctuary,</b><br>The inner sanctuary, or the Holy of Holies, was the most sacred part of the temple where the Ark was placed. The visibility of the poles from the front of the inner sanctuary indicates the Ark's centrality in worship and the accessibility of God's presence to the priests who ministered in the temple. This visibility underscores the connection between the divine and the earthly realm.<p><b>but not from outside the Holy Place;</b><br>The Holy Place was the area just outside the Holy of Holies, accessible only to the priests. The fact that the poles were not visible from outside the Holy Place emphasizes the separation between the sacred and the common, highlighting the holiness of God and the need for sanctification to approach Him. This separation is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, pointing to the need for a mediator, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>and they are there to this day.</b><br>This phrase suggests the enduring presence and stability of the Ark's placement at the time of the chronicler's writing.

This is no doubt right. A letter has fallen out of the Hebrew text. That the chronicler has preserved this remark without modification to suit altered circumstances, and indeed that the compiler of Kings did the same long before him, is a striking instance of the way in which Oriental historiographers are content to borrow with literal exactitude from the works of predecessors, even in cases where such borrowing appears to the modern mind infelicitous.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They drew out</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the staves projected.
