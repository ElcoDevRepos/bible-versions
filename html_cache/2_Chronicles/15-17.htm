Despite Asa's reforms, these sites remained, indicating incomplete religious reform. High places were common in Canaanite culture and persisted among Israelites, often leading to syncretism. This reflects the challenge of eradicating deeply ingrained cultural practices. In <a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>, a parallel account, it is noted that Asa did not remove the high places, suggesting a limitation in his otherwise zealous reforms. The persistence of high places is a recurring issue in Israel's history, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/12-3.htm">2 Kings 12:3</a> and <a href="/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>, where other kings also failed to remove them.<p><b>but Asa&#8217;s heart was fully devoted all his days</b><br>Asa's heart being fully devoted signifies his sincere commitment to God, despite the incomplete removal of high places. This phrase highlights the biblical theme that God values the heart's intention and devotion over external actions. Asa's reign is marked by religious reforms, including the removal of idols and the renewal of the covenant with God (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-8.htm">2 Chronicles 15:8-15</a>). His devotion is contrasted with other kings who turned away from God. Asa's commitment is reminiscent of David, who is described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). This devotion is a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father. Asa's reign, though imperfect, points to the need for a perfect king, fulfilled in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah who reigned for 41 years.

Asa had already &#8220;removed the foreign altars and high places&#8221; from Judah (2 Chron 14:3&#8211;5), yet those located in the northern kingdom (Israel) persisted.<p>&#8226; High places were elevated sites where people mixed true worship with pagan practices, directly violating God&#8217;s command to &#8220;destroy completely all the places&#8221; where false gods were served (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; This unfinished work foreshadows later kings who also left high places standing&#8212;Jehoash &#8220;did what was right&#8230;yet the high places were not removed&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/12-2.htm">2 Kings 12:2&#8211;3</a>), and Amaziah did the same (<a href="/2_kings/14-3.htm">2 Kings 14:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement underlines the difference between personal devotion and national compliance. Even a faithful king could not force every heart to surrender; ongoing vigilance was still needed (cf. 2 Chron 16:7&#8211;9).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Asa&#8217;s heart was fully devoted all his days</b><p>&#8226; Though the high places remained, Scripture affirms Asa&#8217;s inner loyalty: &#8220;Asa&#8217;s heart was fully devoted to the LORD all his days&#8221; (v. 17). Outer shortcomings did not cancel inner sincerity.<p>&#8226; Earlier, we are told &#8220;Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD&#8221; (2 Chron 14:2). His covenant renewal with the people (2 Chron 15:12&#8211;15) showed a wholehearted desire to lead Judah back to God.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Fully devoted&#8221; echoes David&#8217;s example: &#8220;He served Him with a whole heart&#8221; (1 Chron 28:9) and anticipates Jesus&#8217; summary of the Law: &#8220;Love the Lord your God with all your heart&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when rebuked for trusting a foreign alliance late in life (2 Chron 16:7&#8211;12), Asa humbled himself, showing the enduring direction of his heart toward God, unlike kings who turned away entirely (2 Chron 12:1; 26:16).<p>&#8226; The verse balances two realities believers still face:<p>&#8211; Persistent cultural idols can remain entrenched.<p>&#8211; Personal allegiance to the Lord can stay strong amid an imperfect environment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a> highlights a tension that runs through Scripture: external reform may be partial, yet genuine, lifelong devotion is still possible. Asa could not eradicate every high place in Israel, but his unwavering heart modeled steadfast commitment. The verse calls readers to pursue both&#8212;tearing down lingering idols around us while maintaining wholehearted love for the Lord day after day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">But the high places were not taken away.</span>--See on <a href="/2_chronicles/14-3.htm" title="For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the groves:">2Chronicles 14:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-5.htm" title="Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.">2Chronicles 14:5</a>. An explanation of the discrepancy has been suggested there; but a better one perhaps may be thus stated. The former passage relates what the good king had resolved and attempted to effect; the present records his want of success, owing to the obstinate attachment of his people to their old sanctuaries.<p>A similar explanation applies to the apparent contradiction of <a href="/2_chronicles/17-6.htm" title="And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.">2Chronicles 17:6</a> by <a href="/2_chronicles/20-33.htm" title="However, the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts to the God of their fathers.">2Chronicles 20:33</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Out of Israel.</span>--Not in Kings.

It is possible, but scarcely tenable, that, by Israel, the northern kingdom may be here intended.

"The high places" were hills on which sacrifices were illegitimately offered instead of at the chosen place - at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The heart of Asa was perfect all his days</span>. The words, "with Jehovah," following after the word "perfect" in the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>), makes the already plain plainer.
