The presence of chariot commanders indicates a well-organized military force. This context highlights the importance of identifying key figures in battle, as capturing or killing a king could decisively impact the outcome. The role of chariot commanders is also seen in other biblical accounts, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>, where Pharaoh's chariots pursued the Israelites.<p><b>that he was not the king of Israel,</b><br>The king of Israel at this time was Ahab, who had disguised himself to avoid being targeted in battle, as seen earlier in the chapter. This act of disguise reflects the common practice of kings attempting to protect themselves by blending in with their troops. The identification of the king was crucial, as the opposing forces, the Arameans, had been specifically instructed to target Ahab. This reflects the historical context of warfare where leaders were prime targets to demoralize and destabilize the enemy.<p><b>they turned back from pursuing him.</b><br>The decision to cease pursuit upon realizing the target was not the king underscores the specific military orders given to the Aramean forces. This action demonstrates the discipline and obedience of the troops to their commander's instructions. It also highlights the providential protection over Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, who was mistakenly targeted due to his alliance with Ahab. This moment can be seen as an example of divine intervention, where God protects His chosen leaders, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, which speaks of God's protection over His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who allied with Ahab, King of Israel, to fight against Ramoth-gilead.

These men, highly trained and heavily armed, rode in fast, maneuverable chariots&#8212;ancient battlefield tanks that could decide the outcome of a conflict (Jud 4:15; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226;
