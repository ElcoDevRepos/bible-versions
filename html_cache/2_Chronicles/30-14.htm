The altars mentioned here were likely those used for idol worship, which had proliferated under previous kings who led Israel away from the worship of Yahweh. The removal of these altars signifies a return to monotheistic worship and obedience to the covenant with God. This act of cleansing aligns with the reforms initiated by King Hezekiah, who sought to restore proper worship in Judah. The removal of altars is reminiscent of similar actions taken by other reforming kings, such as Asa and Josiah, who also sought to purify the land from idolatry (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-8.htm">2 Chronicles 15:8</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-14</a>).<p><b>and to take away the incense altars</b><br>Incense altars were used in pagan rituals to offer fragrant smoke to deities, a practice that was strictly forbidden in the worship of Yahweh, except in the specific context of the temple rituals as prescribed in the Law of Moses (<a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>). The presence of these altars in Jerusalem indicates the extent to which idolatry had infiltrated the religious practices of the people. By removing these incense altars, the reformers were not only eliminating physical objects but also rejecting the spiritual practices associated with them. This action underscores the importance of purity in worship and the rejection of syncretism, which is the blending of different religious beliefs.<p><b>and throw them into the Kidron Valley</b><br>The Kidron Valley, located to the east of Jerusalem, served as a dumping ground for impurities and idolatrous objects. By casting the altars and incense altars into the Kidron Valley, the reformers were symbolically and physically removing the defilement from the holy city. This act of disposal in the Kidron Valley is consistent with other biblical accounts where idolatrous items were destroyed or discarded in this location (<a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>). The valley thus represents a place of judgment and cleansing, reinforcing the idea of separation from sin. This act can also be seen as a type of Christ, who would later cross the Kidron Valley on His way to the Garden of Gethsemane, symbolizing His role in taking away the sins of the world (<a href="/john/18.htm">John 18:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and called for the celebration of the Passover, seeking to restore proper worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where the temple of the Lord was located and where the people gathered for the Passover.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kidron_valley.htm">Kidron Valley</a></b><br>A valley located on the eastern side of Jerusalem, often used as a place to dispose of impurities and idols, symbolizing the removal of sin and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars_and_incense_altars.htm">Altars and Incense Altars</a></b><br>Structures used for pagan worship and idolatry, which were removed and destroyed as part of Hezekiah's reforms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, which Hezekiah reinstated to renew the covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_purity_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Purity in Worship</a></b><br>Just as Hezekiah removed the altars and idols, we must remove anything in our lives that hinders true worship of God.
