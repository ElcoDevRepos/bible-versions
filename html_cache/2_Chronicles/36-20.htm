The "sword" symbolizes the military might and destruction brought by the Babylonians. Historically, this event occurred in 586 BC when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon besieged Jerusalem, leading to the fall of the city and the destruction of Solomon's Temple. The survivors were those who managed to avoid death during the siege and subsequent slaughter.<p><b>were carried by Nebuchadnezzar into exile in Babylon</b><br>The forced relocation to Babylon is known as the Babylonian Exile or Captivity. This was a common practice in ancient times to prevent rebellion by removing the conquered people from their homeland. Babylon, located in modern-day Iraq, was a significant cultural and political center. The exile fulfilled prophecies given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6-7</a>), who warned of Judah's impending judgment due to their disobedience to God.<p><b>and they became servants to him and his sons</b><br>The exiles served Nebuchadnezzar and his successors, indicating a period of subjugation and servitude. This servitude was both literal, as they worked in various capacities in Babylon, and spiritual, as they were under the rule of a foreign king. This period of servitude is a reminder of the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness to God, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47-48</a>.<p><b>until the kingdom of Persia came to power</b><br>The rise of the Persian Empire under Cyrus the Great marked the end of the Babylonian Empire. In 539 BC, Cyrus conquered Babylon, and his policies were more favorable to the exiled peoples. This change in power fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, which promised that after seventy years, God would bring the exiles back to their land. Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple, as recorded in <a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>. This event is a type of Christ, as Cyrus is seen as a deliverer who sets the captives free, prefiguring Jesus Christ's ultimate deliverance of humanity from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire that conquered Judah and took its people into exile.
