His reign is marked by a departure from the ways of his father, as he led Judah into idolatry. The crossing into Edom signifies a military campaign, as Edom had revolted against Judah's rule. Historically, Edom was a vassal state under Judah, but during Jehoram's reign, they sought independence. The use of chariots indicates the military strength and preparedness of Judah, as chariots were a significant component of ancient Near Eastern warfare. This action reflects the political instability and challenges Jehoram faced during his reign.<p><b>When the Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders,</b><br>The Edomites, descendants of Esau, had a long-standing enmity with Israel and Judah. Their surrounding of Jehoram and his commanders suggests a strategic advantage, possibly due to their knowledge of the terrain. This situation highlights the vulnerability of Jehoram's forces despite their military might. The Edomites' revolt can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Esau in <a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>, where it was foretold that Esau's descendants would eventually break free from Jacob's yoke.<p><b>he rose up and attacked by night.</b><br>Jehoram's decision to attack by night indicates a tactical maneuver to surprise the Edomites. Night attacks were less common and required careful planning and execution. This action demonstrates Jehoram's desperation and willingness to take risks to regain control over Edom. The night attack can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual darkness that had enveloped Judah under Jehoram's rule, contrasting with the light of righteousness that his father, Jehoshaphat, had pursued. This event also foreshadows the ultimate victory of light over darkness, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture and fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Light of the World.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Jehoshaphat, who reigned during a time of spiritual decline and political instability.

Jehoram, king of Judah, personally leads the expedition, signaling both urgency and confidence (cf. <a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;All his chariots&#8221; points to Judah&#8217;s reliance on conventional strength; chariots were the ancient equivalent of armored divisions (see <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Crossing &#8220;into Edom&#8221; shows the rebellion was serious enough to draw the king out of Jerusalem. Historically, Edom had been subject to Judah since the days of David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>); their revolt now exposes the erosion of blessings promised to a faithful Davidic line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When the Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders</b><p>&#8226; Instead of a quick victory, Jehoram finds himself encircled&#8212;Edom gains tactical advantage despite Judah&#8217;s chariots.<p>&#8226; Encirclement echoes earlier warnings that disobedience would lead to enemies hemming Israel in (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>). Jehoram&#8217;s choice to follow the idolatrous path of Ahab (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-6.htm">2 Chronicles 21:6</a>) brings immediate consequence.<p>&#8226; Even the &#8220;chariot commanders&#8221; are trapped, underscoring how human might fails when the covenant is ignored. Compare Asa&#8217;s earlier reliance on the LORD rather than on purely military means (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He rose up and attacked by night</b><p>&#8226; Jehoram&#8217;s nocturnal counter-strike breaks the siege momentarily. Night attacks rely on surprise, compensating for strategic disadvantage&#8212;Gideon used a similar tactic against Midian (<a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the larger narrative shows this success is fleeting; Edom remains in revolt &#8220;to this day&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>). Victory without repentance cannot restore covenant blessings.<p>&#8226; The event mirrors Saul&#8217;s early triumphs that briefly impressed Israel but failed to produce lasting stability because of continued disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>; 15:23).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jehoram&#8217;s march into Edom reveals a king trusting military muscle rather than covenant faithfulness. Encircled, he scrambles for a nighttime rescue that only masks deeper spiritual failure. The episode teaches that even bold leadership and tactical ingenuity cannot substitute for wholehearted allegiance to the LORD, whose promises of security stand or fall with obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Then Jehoram went forth.</span>--<span class= "ital">And Jehoram passed over.</span><p><span class= "bld">With his princes.</span>--<span class= "ital">Captains</span> (<span class= "ital">'im s?r?v</span>); Kings, "to Zair," which appears to be a corruption of "to Seir."

(See on <a href="/2_kings/8-21.htm" title="So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.">2Kings 8:21</a>, where it is added, "and the people fled to their tents.")

The parallel, <a href="/2_kings/8-21.htm">2 Kings 8:21</a>, reads, "to Zair." Of any such place nothing is known, and it has been proposed to supersede the word there by "Self," which a certain amount of similarity of the Hebrew characters might countenance. Possibly by some mishap, not so readily explainable by misoccurrence of characters simply, our words, "with his princes," should stand in place of "to Zair." It must be noted that the two first clauses of the verse in the parallel become something inconsequential (which is not the case with the reading of our text), in that it says, "The king and chariots went forth to a place, and rose up by night," etc. The dislocation is, perhaps, not serious, but our text avoids it in reading, "The king, princes, and chariots went forth, and rose up by night and smote," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/21-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Jehoram</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3088.htm">Strong's 3088: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoram -- 'the LORD is exalted', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">crossed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
