The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the center of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. By taking treasures from the temple, Ahaz demonstrated a lack of reverence for God and His sacred space. This act reflects a broader pattern of idolatry and apostasy during Ahaz's reign, as he sought alliances with pagan nations rather than relying on the LORD. This action is reminiscent of other instances in the Old Testament where leaders misused temple resources, such as in <a href="/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>, where Ahaz also took silver and gold from the temple to bribe the king of Assyria.<p><b>from the royal palace</b><br>The royal palace was the seat of the king's authority and wealth. By taking treasures from his own palace, Ahaz depleted the resources meant for the governance and defense of his kingdom. This act signifies desperation and a willingness to sacrifice the stability and prosperity of his own reign for temporary political gain. Historically, this reflects the political instability of the region during this period, as smaller kingdoms like Judah were caught between larger empires such as Assyria and Egypt.<p><b>and from the princes</b><br>The princes were the leaders and nobles of Judah, who held significant influence and wealth. By taking from them, Ahaz not only weakened his own political support but also demonstrated a disregard for the welfare of his people. This action likely caused discontent among the ruling class and further destabilized his rule. It highlights the internal strife and division within Judah during Ahaz's reign, as recorded in <a href="/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3:1-5</a>, where the prophet speaks of the removal of support and supply from Jerusalem and Judah.<p><b>and had presented it to the king of Assyria</b><br>Ahaz sought the aid of Tiglath-Pileser III, the king of Assyria, to protect Judah from its enemies, particularly the alliance of Israel and Aram. This political maneuver reflects the common practice of vassalage in the ancient Near East, where smaller states paid tribute to more powerful empires for protection. However, this reliance on Assyria was contrary to the prophetic counsel given to Ahaz, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/7-10.htm">Isaiah 7:10-12</a>, where God offered Ahaz a sign to trust in Him instead of foreign alliances.<p><b>it did not help him</b><br>Despite Ahaz's efforts to secure Assyrian assistance, his actions ultimately failed to bring the desired peace and security to Judah. This outcome underscores the futility of relying on human alliances and wealth rather than trusting in God's provision and protection. The failure of Ahaz's strategy serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobedience and lack of faith, echoing the warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>, where God outlines the curses for covenant unfaithfulness. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Judah, as reliance on foreign powers led to further entanglement and eventual exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned during a time of spiritual decline.

LORD</b><p>&#8220;Although Ahaz had taken a portion from the house of the LORD&#8221; (2 Chron 28:21).<p>&#8226; Ahaz raided the sacred treasures&#8212;things dedicated for worship and service (cf. <a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>).<p>&#8226; In so doing, he treated holy things as bargaining chips, revealing a heart that valued politics over piety (cf. <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; His choice stood in direct contrast to earlier kings who honored the temple and prospered for it, such as Jehoshaphat (2 Chron 17:3&#8211;5).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the royal palace</b><p>&#8226; He did not stop with temple resources; he stripped his own palace coffers (cf. <a href="/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15&#8211;16</a>, where Hezekiah would later do something similar yet with repentant humility).<p>&#8226; This indicates desperation. Ahaz believed earthly power could secure what obedience to God should have provided (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and from the princes</b><p>&#8226; Ahaz forced the leaders of Judah to contribute, spreading the cost of his fear&#8208;driven policy onto the nation&#8217;s elite (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11&#8211;18</a>, Samuel&#8217;s warning about kings who take).<p>&#8226; His action sowed distrust and division among the ruling class, weakening Judah internally even before Assyria struck externally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had presented it to the king of Assyria</b><p>&#8226; Ahaz sent the loot to Tiglath-Pileser III, hoping to buy protection (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of seeking the LORD, he bowed to a pagan empire, reversing the intended direction of influence; Judah was to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6&#8211;7</a>), not subservient to them (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; This payment signaled covenantal compromise, much like when Israel trusted Egypt instead of God (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it did not help him</b><p>&#8226; The inspired writer delivers the verdict: all that treasure &#8220;did not help him.&#8221; Assyria took the money and still oppressed Judah (2 Chron 28:20).<p>&#8226; Earthly alliances apart from God bring disappointment (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Ahaz&#8217;s experience foreshadows Jesus&#8217; teaching: &#8220;What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ahaz emptied the temple, the palace, and his officials&#8217; reserves, funneling sacred and royal wealth into an Assyrian bribe. Scripture records the result in five sobering words: &#8220;it did not help him.&#8221; The verse underscores a timeless truth&#8212;trust placed anywhere but in the Lord is wasted. Sacred things are not bargaining chips, political schemes cannot replace obedience, and ungodly alliances always disappoint.
