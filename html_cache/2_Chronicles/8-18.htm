Tyre was renowned for its maritime expertise, and Hiram's provision of ships and experienced sailors underscores the strong diplomatic and trade relations between Tyre and Israel. This collaboration highlights the importance of alliances in the ancient Near East and the mutual benefits derived from such partnerships.<p><b>along with crews of experienced sailors</b><br>The sailors from Tyre were known for their seafaring skills, which were unmatched in the region. This expertise was crucial for long voyages, such as the one to Ophir. The mention of experienced sailors indicates the complexity and danger of ancient maritime expeditions, requiring knowledge of navigation, weather patterns, and ship maintenance. This detail emphasizes the advanced state of maritime technology and trade during Solomon's reign.<p><b>They went with Solomon&#8217;s servants to Ophir</b><br>Ophir is a location mentioned several times in the Bible, known for its wealth and resources, particularly gold (<a href="/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>, <a href="/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>). The exact location of Ophir remains uncertain, with theories suggesting it could be in regions such as southern Arabia, eastern Africa, or even India. The joint venture between Tyrian and Israelite crews signifies the extensive trade networks and the pursuit of wealth and resources that characterized Solomon's kingdom.<p><b>and acquired from there 450 talents of gold</b><br>A talent was a large unit of weight, and 450 talents would be an enormous quantity of gold, reflecting the prosperity and wealth of Solomon's reign. This acquisition of gold not only contributed to Solomon's wealth but also to the splendor of the Temple and his palace. The wealth from Ophir is a testament to the economic strategies employed by Solomon, which included international trade and resource acquisition.<p><b>which they delivered to King Solomon</b><br>The delivery of gold to Solomon signifies the successful completion of the expedition and the fulfillment of the trade agreement between Hiram and Solomon. This wealth contributed to Solomon's reputation as a wise and prosperous king, as described in <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-29</a>. The accumulation of gold and other resources under Solomon's rule is often seen as a foreshadowing of the messianic kingdom, where peace and prosperity abound.

To what port the vessels were sent is not expressly stated. Probably they put in at Joppa (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 2:16</a>). Others assume the meaning to be that the ships were sent from Tyre to Ezion-geber, and then ask whether they were dragged across the desert which divides the Mediterranean from the gulf of Akaba, or whether they circumnavigated Africa. The dilemma is only apparent. The Greek historians of later times often speak of the transport of ships overland; and the galleys of Solomon's age were probably small. Even the circumnavigation of Africa was achieved by a Ph?nician expedition sent out by Necho about four centuries later (Herod, iv. 42). But neither alternative seems necessary. If Huram provided Solomon with skilled mariners, they would naturally sail from Tyre to Joppa in their own ships. The Tyrian vessels may have been left at Joppa, while a portion of their crews proceeded, by Solomon's order, to Ezion-geber. In short, "ships and servants" means "ships <span class= "ital">with</span> servants," or "ships conveying servants."<p><span class= "bld">And they went.</span>--Huram's mariners.

But it is almost impossible to see how he could do so. The parallel much helps us, by saying that "Solomon made a navy," and Hiram assisted. by manning it with competent sailors; he "sent in the navy his servants," etc. (<a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26, 27</a>). Some have suggested that the explanation is that Hiram gave materials, workmen, and models for Solomon's ships, possibly having ships lying in the Red Sea. The parallel, however, meets all difficulties, and saves the necessity of going far for farfetched explanations. <span class="cmt_word">Ophir</span>. This was the name of the son of Joktan (<a href="/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25-29</a>), who, it is supposed, gave his name to the place or land in the south of Arabia. It is still quite an unsettled question, however, where Ophir was situated, though an Arabian situation is on every account the most probable (see Exposition <a href="/1_chronicles/29-4.htm">1 Chronicles 29:4</a>; and Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:637-642).
