His grandmother, Athaliah, had attempted to destroy the royal line, but Joash was hidden and preserved by Jehosheba, the wife of the priest Jehoiada. This act of preservation is reminiscent of Moses being hidden from Pharaoh, symbolizing God's protection over His chosen leaders. Joash's early reign was heavily influenced by Jehoiada, who acted as a mentor and guide, ensuring that the young king's rule began on a foundation of faithfulness to God.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years</b><br>The forty-year reign of Joash is significant, as it mirrors the biblical pattern of testing and fulfillment, such as the Israelites' forty years in the wilderness. Jerusalem, the city of David, serves as the political and spiritual center of Judah, emphasizing the importance of Joash's rule in maintaining the Davidic line. His reign is marked by initial reforms and the restoration of the temple, reflecting a period of religious renewal. However, after Jehoiada's death, Joash's reign deteriorated, showing the consequences of straying from godly counsel.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba</b><br>Zibiah's mention provides insight into Joash's lineage and the geographical context of his family. Beersheba, located in the southern part of Judah, was a significant city in biblical history, often representing the southern boundary of the Promised Land. It was a place associated with the patriarchs, such as Abraham and Isaac, who had encounters with God there. Zibiah's origin from Beersheba may suggest a connection to the broader narrative of God's covenant with His people, emphasizing the continuity of His promises through the line of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Joash became king of Judah at the tender age of seven.
