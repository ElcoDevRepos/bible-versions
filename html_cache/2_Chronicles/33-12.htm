Historically, this refers to the period when he was taken captive by the Assyrians, as recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>. The Assyrian Empire was a dominant force during this time, known for its military prowess and harsh treatment of captives. Manasseh's distress likely included both physical suffering and a realization of his spiritual waywardness. This moment of crisis is a turning point, illustrating how God can use difficult circumstances to bring about repentance.<p><b>Manasseh sought the favor of the LORD his God</b><br>Despite his previous idolatry and rebellion against God, Manasseh turned back to the LORD, indicating a significant change of heart. This phrase highlights the personal relationship Manasseh had with God, as he sought divine favor. The act of seeking God's favor is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with prayer and repentance. It reflects a recognition of God's sovereignty and mercy, as seen in other biblical figures like David (Psalm 51) and Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/20.htm">2 Kings 20:1-6</a>).<p><b>and earnestly humbled himself</b><br>Humility is a key aspect of repentance in the biblical narrative. Manasseh's earnest humility suggests a deep, sincere acknowledgment of his sins and a desire to change. This humility is contrasted with his previous pride and idolatry, as he had led Judah into sin by erecting altars to foreign gods (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3-7</a>). The transformation in Manasseh's heart is a testament to the power of genuine repentance and God's willingness to forgive.<p><b>before the God of his fathers</b><br>This phrase connects Manasseh to the covenantal faith of his ancestors, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David. It underscores the continuity of God's promises and the importance of returning to the faith of one's forebears. The "God of his fathers" is a reminder of the enduring relationship between God and the people of Israel, despite their frequent disobedience. This return to the God of his fathers signifies a restoration of the covenant relationship, aligning Manasseh with the faith and practices of his righteous predecessors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initially led the nation into idolatry and evil practices but later repented and sought the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Manasseh reigned as king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom Manasseh eventually turned back to in repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_captivity.htm">Assyrian Captivity</a></b><br>Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians, which led to his distress and subsequent repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>The act of turning away from sin and seeking God's forgiveness, exemplified by Manasseh's change of heart.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_distress_to_lead_to_repentance.htm">The Power of Distress to Lead to Repentance</a></b><br>Distress can be a catalyst for spiritual awakening and turning back to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_humility.htm">The Importance of Humility</a></b><br>True repentance requires humility, acknowledging one's sins and need for God's grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_readiness_to_forgive.htm">God's Readiness to Forgive</a></b><br>No matter how far one has strayed, God is always ready to forgive those who earnestly seek Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_legacy_of_repentance.htm">The Legacy of Repentance</a></b><br>Manasseh's account shows that a legacy of sin can be transformed into a testimony of God's grace through repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_personal_responsibility.htm">The Role of Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is responsible for their own repentance and relationship with God, regardless of past actions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_33_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 33:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Manasseh_s_humility_true_repentance.htm">How does Manasseh's humility in 2 Chronicles 33:12 demonstrate true repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_God_s_mercy_in_Manasseh_s_prayer.htm">What can we learn about God's mercy from Manasseh's prayer in 2 Chronicles 33:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Manasseh_Prodigal_Son_connection.htm">How does Manasseh's story connect with the Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_the_Lord_in_distress_like_Manasseh.htm">In what ways can we seek the Lord during personal distress, like Manasseh?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Manasseh_inspire_return_to_God.htm">How can Manasseh's example inspire us to lead others back to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_33_12_Power_of_repentance.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 33:12 demonstrate the power of repentance and forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_2_Chronicles_33_12_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in 2 Chronicles 33:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Manasseh_s_story_divine_justice_rethink.htm">How does Manasseh's story in 2 Chronicles 33:12 challenge our understanding of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_33.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_science_verify_manasseh's_prayer.htm">If God truly heard and answered Manasseh&#8217;s prayer in 2 Chronicles 33:12&#8211;13, what scientific or historical basis is there to verify this miraculous restoration?

His &#8220;distress&#8221; was no light trouble; it was the crushing consequence of rebellion. Scripture shows repeatedly that God uses hardship to awaken hearts (see <a href="/jonah/2-1.htm">Jonah 2:1&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/luke/15-14.htm">Luke 15:14&#8211;17</a>). Here, the pain is real, the chains literal, and the spiritual crisis unavoidable. Manasseh&#8217;s misery becomes God&#8217;s megaphone, urging him to look up.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Manasseh sought the favor of the LORD his God</b><p>&#8220;Sought&#8221; implies deliberate pursuit&#8212;he didn&#8217;t merely regret getting caught; he turned to the LORD &#8220;his&#8221; God. God had never ceased to be sovereign over him, even while Manasseh desecrated the temple (2 Chron 33:4&#8211;7). The phrase echoes other calls to seek the LORD with all the heart (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-12.htm">Jeremiah 29:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; He petitioned the very God he had provoked.<p>&#8226; He believed God still hears, aligning with promises like 2 Chron 7:14: &#8220;if My people&#8230; humble themselves and pray&#8230; I will hear.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This seeking is relational, not ritual. It affirms that no sinner is beyond reach when repentance is genuine.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And earnestly humbled himself</b><p>Humility is the doorway to grace (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>). &#8220;Earnestly&#8221; points to intensity&#8212;no half&#8208;hearted apology. Manasseh laid aside his royal pride, a striking reversal after decades of idolatry. The narrative parallels Ahab&#8217;s brief humbling (<a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27&#8211;29</a>) yet surpasses it in sincerity and lasting fruit (see Manasseh&#8217;s later reforms, 2 Chron 33:15&#8211;16). Genuine humility:<p>&#8226; Acknowledges God&#8217;s righteous judgment.<p>&#8226; Admits personal guilt without excuse (<a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Submits to God&#8217;s will, trusting His mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before the God of his fathers</b><p>Manasseh returns to the covenantal roots of Judah&#8212;&#8220;the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>). The phrase underscores:<p>&#8226; Continuity: The Lord who called Israel remains the only true God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Heritage: He repents within the story of his ancestors, unlike earlier when he &#8220;made Judah and Jerusalem to err&#8221; (2 Chron 33:9).<p>&#8226; Community: Personal repentance has national implications, preparing the ground for spiritual restoration similar to Hezekiah&#8217;s reforms (2 Chron 29&#8211;31).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12</a> presents a literal, historical king shackled in Babylon, discovering that divine mercy meets repentant sinners even in chains. Distress led Manasseh to seek, seek led him to humble, and humility reconnected him with the covenant God of his fathers. The verse assures believers today that no depth of sin or consequence is beyond God&#8217;s reach when we earnestly turn to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">When he was in affliction.</span>--See this phrase in <a href="/2_chronicles/28-22.htm" title="And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.">2Chronicles 28:22</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He besought.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">stroked the face,</span> a curious realistic phrase occurring in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm" title="And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?">Exodus 32:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The God of his fathers.</span>--Whom he had forsaken for the gods of aliens.
