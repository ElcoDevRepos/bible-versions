His arrival is significant because he is known for speaking the truth, unlike the false prophets who often told the king what he wanted to hear. Micaiah's presence underscores the tension between true prophecy and the king's desire for favorable predictions. This moment is set in the context of a royal court where prophets were often summoned to provide divine guidance.<p><b>the king asked him</b><br>King Ahab of Israel, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of Yahweh, directly questions Micaiah. This interaction highlights the king's authority and his role in seeking divine counsel, albeit often with ulterior motives. Ahab's inquiry reflects the common practice of consulting prophets before military campaigns, a tradition rooted in the belief that divine favor was crucial for success.<p><b>&#8220;Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?&#8221;</b><br>Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River, in the territory of Gilead. It had been a point of contention between Israel and Aram (Syria). Ahab's question reveals his intention to reclaim the city, which had been lost to the Arameans. The phrasing of the question suggests a desire for confirmation of his plans, rather than genuine openness to divine direction. This reflects a broader biblical theme of leaders seeking God's will only when it aligns with their own desires.<p><b>&#8220;Go up and triumph,&#8221; Micaiah replied</b><br>Micaiah's response is initially surprising, as it seems to align with the false prophets' assurances of victory. However, his tone is likely sarcastic, as indicated by the context and Ahab's reaction in the following verses. This response serves as a test of Ahab's sincerity in seeking God's will. Micaiah's words echo the language of victory often used by prophets, but his true message is revealed later, emphasizing the importance of discerning genuine prophecy.<p><b>&#8220;for they will be delivered into your hand.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase, while seemingly promising success, is part of Micaiah's ironic reply. The language of deliverance is common in biblical narratives where God grants victory to His people. However, in this context, it foreshadows the impending judgment on Ahab, as Micaiah later reveals the true vision of Israel's defeat. This moment underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the futility of opposing God's will, a recurring message throughout the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micaiah.htm">Micaiah</a></b><br>A prophet of the Lord who is known for speaking the truth, even when it is unpopular or dangerous.

Like Elijah before Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>), he comes as a lone voice for truth.<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that God continues to provide witnesses even when falsehood seems dominant (<a href="/romans/11-3.htm">Romans 11:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The king asked him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;the king asked him, &#8216;Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?&#8217;&#8221; (v. 14b)<p>&#8226; Both King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah are present (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-3.htm">2 Chronicles 18:3</a>). Jehoshaphat wants a true word from the LORD (v. 6).<p>&#8226; The question is direct, yet Ahab&#8217;s heart is already bent toward battle (v. 3, 12). Compare this with Balaam&#8217;s repeated inquiries while already desiring Balak&#8217;s reward (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture warns that those who seek guidance with predetermined agendas often hear only what they want (<a href="/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go up and triumph</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;Go up and triumph,&#8217; Micaiah replied&#8230;&#8221; (v. 14c)<p>&#8226; Micaiah&#8217;s words mirror the chorus of the false prophets (v. 11). Their identical promise&#8212;&#8220;Go up and triumph&#8221;&#8212;exposes the emptiness of flattery.<p>&#8226; His tone is ironic. Ahab senses it, which is why he immediately insists on &#8220;nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD&#8221; (v. 15).<p>&#8226; Sarcasm in prophetic speech is not unprecedented (<a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>). It forces hearers to confront their motives.<p>&#8226; This moment highlights the difference between words that please people and words that please God (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will be delivered into your hand</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8216;for they will be delivered into your hand.&#8217;&#8221; (v. 14d)<p>&#8226; Taken at face value, the line predicts victory. Yet Micaiah soon gives the real prophecy: &#8220;I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd&#8221; (v. 16).<p>&#8226; The contrast reveals Ahab&#8217;s testing. God allows delusion for those who reject truth (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/18-20.htm">2 Chronicles 18:20&#8211;22</a> explains that a lying spirit was permitted to entice Ahab through the majority prophets. Micaiah&#8217;s brief echo unmasks that deception.<p>&#8226; The final outcome proves Micaiah&#8217;s true message: Ahab dies in battle despite his disguise (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-33.htm">2 Chronicles 18:33&#8211;34</a>), confirming <a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21&#8211;22</a>&#8212;true prophecy is verified by fulfillment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/18-14.htm">2 Chronicles 18:14</a> records the initial, ironic reply of the lone faithful prophet to a king committed to his own will. By echoing the empty assurances of the crowd, Micaiah exposes Ahab&#8217;s craving for flattery and sets the stage for the uncompromising word of judgment that follows. The verse reminds us that God may permit deceptive voices when hearts refuse truth, yet He still raises a clear, faithful witness whose words stand proven in the end.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Shall I forbear.</span>--Kings, <span class= "ital">shall we forbear.</span> (See Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/18-5.htm" title="Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?

It has been well described as the ironical echo of the language of the unreal prophets. Micaiah begins by answering a fool according to his folly, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to his own heart's desire. He had just come from some place of imprisonment or punishment (ver. 25). And he so spoke or so looked that the king should know he had not spoken his last word in answer to the inquiry addressed to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/18-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Micaiah arrived,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
