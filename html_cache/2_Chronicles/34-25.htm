Throughout the Old Testament, forsaking God often led to dire consequences for the Israelites. This abandonment of God is a violation of the covenant established at Sinai, where the Israelites pledged exclusive worship to Yahweh. The forsaking of God is a central issue in the prophetic literature, where prophets like Jeremiah and Hosea lament Israel's spiritual adultery.<p><b>and burned incense to other gods</b><br>Burning incense was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religious rituals, symbolizing prayers or offerings to deities. The Israelites' adoption of this practice for other gods indicates syncretism, where they mixed the worship of Yahweh with pagan practices. This act directly contravenes the first commandment, which prohibits the worship of other gods. The worship of Baal and Asherah, among others, was prevalent during this period, as evidenced by archaeological findings of altars and idols.<p><b>that they might provoke Me to anger</b><br>Provoking God to anger is a frequent motif in the Old Testament, illustrating the personal nature of God's relationship with His people. God's anger is not arbitrary but a response to covenant unfaithfulness and idolatry. This anthropomorphic expression helps convey the seriousness of Israel's sin and the inevitable divine response. The prophets often warned that such provocation would lead to judgment and exile.<p><b>with all the works of their hands</b><br>This phrase underscores the futility and idolatry of human-made objects of worship. The "works of their hands" refers to idols crafted by the Israelites, which are powerless and contrast with the living God who created the universe. Isaiah and Jeremiah both mock the absurdity of worshiping man-made idols, emphasizing that these objects cannot see, hear, or save.<p><b>My wrath will be poured out upon this place</b><br>The "place" refers to Jerusalem and the temple, the center of Jewish worship and identity. God's wrath being poured out signifies impending judgment, often depicted as a cup of wrath in prophetic literature. This judgment was historically realized in the Babylonian conquest and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The imagery of pouring out suggests a complete and overwhelming judgment.<p><b>and will not be quenched.&#8217;</b><br>The unquenchable nature of God's wrath indicates the certainty and severity of the coming judgment. This phrase echoes the warnings of other prophets, such as Isaiah and Ezekiel, who spoke of a judgment that could not be averted once decreed. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent disobedience and the seriousness of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his reforms and efforts to bring the nation back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which had fallen into idolatry and was subject to God's impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/huldah_the_prophetess.htm">Huldah the Prophetess</a></b><br>The prophetess who delivered God's message of judgment and mercy to King Josiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where the temple was located and where idolatrous practices had been taking place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of other gods, which was prevalent in Judah and provoked God's anger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to God's wrath.

The word "quenched," which immediately follows, suits the word "kindled," and what with the testimony of the Septuagint, both here and in ver. 21, and the Hebrew in both passages of the parallel, suggests that "poured" is the substitution, by some mishap, of a copyist - a mishap, for instance, that might result from the copyist writing from the speech of some one, and not from his own inspection.
