The "heaps" refer to the piles of offerings brought by the people in response to Hezekiah's call for tithes and contributions to support the priests and Levites. This scene occurs after Hezekiah's reforms, which included reopening the temple and reinstituting the Passover. The heaps symbolize the people's renewed commitment to God and the abundance of their offerings, reflecting a time of spiritual revival in Judah.<p><b>they blessed the LORD</b><br>To "bless the LORD" means to praise and thank God for His provision and faithfulness. This act of blessing is a response to the visible evidence of God's favor and the people's obedience. It acknowledges God's sovereignty and goodness, recognizing that the abundance of offerings is a result of His blessing upon the nation. This phrase connects to other instances in Scripture where leaders and people bless God for His mighty works, such as in Psalms and the dedication of the temple by Solomon.<p><b>and His people Israel</b><br>The term "Israel" here refers to the people of Judah, as the northern kingdom of Israel had already fallen to Assyria. By blessing "His people Israel," Hezekiah and his officials are acknowledging the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people. This phrase highlights the unity and identity of the people as belonging to God, despite the political division between Judah and the former northern kingdom. It also underscores the communal aspect of worship and blessing, as the entire nation is involved in this act of devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship of Yahweh.
