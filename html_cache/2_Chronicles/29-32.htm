In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29</a>, King Hezekiah is leading a religious reform to restore proper worship in the temple. The assembly's participation reflects a unified commitment to returning to the covenantal relationship with God. This communal aspect is reminiscent of other instances in the Old Testament where the people of Israel come together for significant religious observances, such as the dedication of Solomon's Temple (1 Kings 8).<p><b>was seventy bulls</b><br>The number seventy often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, as seen in the seventy elders of Israel (<a href="/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>) and the seventy years of Babylonian captivity (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). Bulls were considered valuable offerings due to their size and significance, often used in major sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). The offering of seventy bulls signifies a substantial and complete act of atonement and dedication to God.<p><b>a hundred rams</b><br>Rams were commonly used in sacrificial offerings, symbolizing strength and leadership. The offering of a hundred rams indicates a significant and generous act of worship. In the context of Hezekiah's reforms, this large number underscores the seriousness of the people's repentance and their desire to restore their relationship with God. Rams were also used in the consecration of priests (<a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15-18</a>), linking this offering to the restoration of proper priestly functions.<p><b>and two hundred lambs</b><br>Lambs were frequently used in daily sacrifices and during Passover, symbolizing innocence and purity (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>). The offering of two hundred lambs emphasizes the people's desire for purification and renewal. This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The large number of lambs offered reflects the abundance of the people's repentance and dedication.<p><b>all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD</b><br>Burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total devotion and surrender to God (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). This type of offering was meant to atone for sin and express complete dedication to the LORD. In the context of Hezekiah's reforms, these offerings represent a renewed commitment to the covenant and a desire to restore proper worship. The phrase underscores the purpose of the offerings: to honor and please the LORD, aligning with the broader biblical theme of wholehearted devotion to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored temple worship.

Scripture faithfully records exact numbers, underlining that real animals were truly offered on a specific day in history (compare <a href="/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62&#8211;63</a>, where Solomon&#8217;s offerings are likewise tallied). The chronicler&#8217;s detail shows that God notices every act of obedience and that worship is never vague or symbolic only; it happens in concrete, measurable ways.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The assembly brought</b><p>Worship was not performed by priests alone; &#8220;the assembly&#8221;&#8212;the people&#8212;gathered and gave. Similar scenes appear in <a href="/exodus/35-20.htm">Exodus 35:20&#8211;22</a> and <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44&#8211;47</a>, where communal devotion overflows in corporate giving. Here, newly purified Judah (2 Chron 29:31) steps forward together, illustrating that revival is communal, not merely individual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seventy bulls</b><p>Bulls were the costliest animals (<a href="/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13&#8211;14</a>). Offering seventy signals vast gratitude and a desire for full atonement, echoing <a href="/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12&#8211;32</a>, where large numbers of bulls are presented during the Feast of Tabernacles for national atonement. Their sheer magnitude testifies that nothing was withheld from God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A hundred rams</b><p>Rams evoke the substitute provided for Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>) and are prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a> for burnt offerings when worshipers cannot afford bulls but desire more than a lamb. A hundred rams reflects both abundance and a humble acknowledgment that God provides the substitute we need.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two hundred lambs</b><p>Lambs signify innocence and redemption, reaching back to the Passover lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3&#8211;6</a>) and forward to &#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). By bringing two hundred, the people saturate the altar with reminders that only the shedding of spotless blood secures forgiveness (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All these were for a burnt offering</b><p>A burnt offering (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3&#8211;9</a>) is entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total surrender. Nothing returns to the offerer. The volume of offerings underscores a corporate declaration: Judah gives itself wholly to the LORD. Paul later urges the same heart posture&#8212;&#8220;present your bodies as a living sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the LORD</b><p>Every animal, every flame, every ascending aroma was &#8220;to the LORD.&#8221; Worship&#8217;s aim is never self-promotion or ritual for ritual&#8217;s sake (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4&#8211;5</a>). By directing the sacrifices solely to Him, Judah obeys <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>&#8217;s timeless principle: do all &#8220;in the name of the Lord.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/29-32.htm">2 Chronicles 29:32</a> records real numbers of real animals offered by a newly revived nation.
