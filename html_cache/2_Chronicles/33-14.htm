The City of David refers to the ancient core of Jerusalem, emphasizing the historical and spiritual significance of this location. Rebuilding the wall signifies a restoration of protection and a return to the priorities of his forefathers, such as David and Solomon, who valued the security and sanctity of Jerusalem.<p><b>from west of Gihon in the valley</b><br>The Gihon Spring was a crucial water source for Jerusalem, located in the Kidron Valley. This geographical detail highlights the strategic importance of securing water access, which was vital for the city's survival, especially during sieges. The mention of the valley underscores the topographical challenges and the engineering feats required to fortify this area.<p><b>to the entrance of the Fish Gate</b><br>The Fish Gate was one of the gates of Jerusalem, likely named for its proximity to the fish market or its use by fishermen. This gate is mentioned in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/nehemiah/3-3.htm">Nehemiah 3:3</a>, indicating its continued importance in the city's infrastructure. The rebuilding of this gate signifies economic revitalization and the restoration of trade routes.<p><b>and he brought it around the hill of Ophel</b><br>Ophel refers to a fortified hill in Jerusalem, situated between the City of David and the Temple Mount. This area was significant for its defensive position and its proximity to the temple, symbolizing a renewed focus on both physical and spiritual fortification. The mention of Ophel connects to the broader biblical theme of God as a fortress and protector.<p><b>and heightened it considerably</b><br>Heightening the wall considerably suggests a significant investment in the city's defense, reflecting a shift in Manasseh's priorities towards safeguarding his people. This action can be seen as a physical manifestation of his repentance and desire to align with God's will, reminiscent of the protective measures taken by other righteous kings in Judah's history.<p><b>He also stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah</b><br>This strategic move indicates a comprehensive approach to national security, extending beyond Jerusalem to the entire kingdom of Judah. By placing military commanders in fortified cities, Manasseh ensured a robust defense network, which was crucial for maintaining peace and stability.
