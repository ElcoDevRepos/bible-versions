Gerar was a Philistine city located in the Negev region, southwest of Judah. Historically, Gerar was a significant city during the time of the patriarchs, as seen in <a href="/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20 and 26</a>, where Abraham and Isaac had interactions with the Philistine king Abimelech. The attack on the cities around Gerar signifies a strategic move to secure Judah's borders and eliminate potential threats. This action reflects the common practice of ancient Near Eastern kings to expand their influence and secure their territories after a military victory.<p><b>because the terror of the LORD had fallen upon them</b><br>The "terror of the LORD" indicates a divine intervention that instilled fear in the hearts of the inhabitants of the surrounding cities. This concept is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God causes fear to fall upon Israel's enemies, leading to their defeat (e.g., <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>, <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a>). It underscores the belief that God actively participates in the affairs of His people, granting them victory over their adversaries. This divine terror serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and power, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled through His chosen leaders.<p><b>They plundered all the cities</b><br>Plundering was a common practice in ancient warfare, where the victors would seize goods, livestock, and other valuables from the defeated. This act not only enriched the victors but also served as a means of weakening the enemy. In the context of Asa's campaign, the plundering of the cities around Gerar would have provided Judah with resources and wealth, strengthening the kingdom economically and militarily. This action also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to bless and protect His people when they are obedient to His commands.<p><b>since there was much plunder there</b><br>The abundance of plunder indicates the prosperity of the cities around Gerar before their defeat. This detail highlights the extent of the victory achieved by Asa and his forces. The wealth acquired from these cities would have been significant, contributing to the prosperity and stability of Judah during Asa's reign. This phrase also serves as a testament to God's provision for His people, rewarding their faithfulness and reliance on Him for victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The King of Judah who led the nation in a period of religious reform and military success.
