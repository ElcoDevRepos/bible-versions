Joash became king at a young age, and Jehoiada served as his mentor and guide. Their partnership underscores the importance of godly leadership and stewardship in the restoration of the temple. The act of giving money reflects the commitment to use resources wisely for God's work, a principle seen throughout Scripture, such as in the building of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21-29</a>).<p><b>to those who supervised the labor on the house of the LORD</b><br>The supervisors were responsible for ensuring that the work on the temple was done correctly and efficiently. This reflects the biblical principle of accountability and the need for skilled leadership in God's work. The "house of the LORD" refers to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites. The temple's restoration was crucial for maintaining the spiritual life of the nation.<p><b>to hire stonecutters and carpenters</b><br>Stonecutters and carpenters were skilled laborers essential for the temple's restoration. Stonecutters would have been responsible for preparing the stones used in the temple's structure, while carpenters worked with wood for various parts of the building. This highlights the importance of using skilled artisans in the service of God, reminiscent of the craftsmen Bezalel and Oholiab in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>).<p><b>to restore the house of the LORD</b><br>The restoration of the temple was a significant religious and cultural event for the Israelites. The temple had fallen into disrepair during the reigns of previous kings who had neglected or desecrated it. Restoring the temple was not just a physical act but a spiritual renewal, symbolizing a return to proper worship and covenant faithfulness. This act of restoration can be seen as a type of Christ, who restores and reconciles humanity to God.<p><b>as well as workers in iron and bronze</b><br>Iron and bronze workers were necessary for creating the temple's various implements and structural components. These metals were used for tools, fixtures, and possibly for decorative elements. The use of iron and bronze signifies strength and durability, qualities that are often associated with God's eternal nature and His unchanging word (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p><b>to repair the house of the LORD</b><br>Repairing the temple was an act of reverence and obedience to God. It was a physical manifestation of the people's desire to honor God and maintain a place for His presence among them. This repair work can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and repentance, themes that are prevalent throughout the Bible, such as in the prophetic calls to return to God (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_joash.htm">King Joash</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the restoration of the temple.
