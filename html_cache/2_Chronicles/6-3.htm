This assembly likely took place in Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, during the dedication of Solomon's Temple. The act of standing is a sign of respect and reverence, indicating the solemnity of the occasion. This assembly reflects the unity of the twelve tribes, a rare occurrence in Israel's history, and echoes the gathering at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>) when the Law was given. It also prefigures the unity of believers in Christ, as seen in the New Testament church (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1</a>).<p><b>the king turned around</b><br>King Solomon, the son of David, is the central figure in this narrative. His turning around suggests a shift in focus from the altar, where he had been offering sacrifices, to the people. This act symbolizes his role as both a mediator between God and the people and a leader who is attentive to the needs of his subjects. Solomon's actions here can be seen as a type of Christ, who mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>and blessed them all</b><br>The blessing of the people by the king is a significant act, reflecting the priestly role that the king sometimes assumed in Israel. This blessing is not merely a wish for prosperity but a pronouncement of God's favor and presence among His people. It recalls the Aaronic blessing in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where the priests were instructed to bless the Israelites. This act of blessing also points forward to the ultimate blessing found in Jesus Christ, who blesses all nations through His redemptive work (<a href="/galatians/3-14.htm">Galatians 3:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David, Solomon is the king of Israel who is known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.

Their standing signals reverence and readiness, much like the people who &#8220;stood at the foot of the mountain&#8221; to hear God&#8217;s voice (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Standing together also shows unity; they had just witnessed the cloud of God&#8217;s glory filling the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13-14</a>). In a similar moment centuries later, Ezra read the Law and &#8220;all the people stood up&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene underscores that worship is not passive. The entire nation actively participates, mirroring Paul&#8217;s call that &#8220;in one mind and one voice&#8221; God&#8217;s people glorify Him (<a href="/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king turned around</b><p>&#8226; Solomon had been facing the altar, leading sacrifices (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-12.htm">2 Chronicles 6:12-13</a>). Turning around places him face-to-face with the people, portraying a mediator who has approached God on their behalf and now brings the blessing back to them&#8212;foreshadowing the greater Mediator to come (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The parallel account says, &#8220;Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-14.htm">1 Kings 8:14</a>). The physical movement highlights that worship involves both Godward devotion and people-ward ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and blessed them all</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Blessed&#8221; here refers to a spoken benediction, much like the priestly words: &#8220;The LORD bless you and keep you&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23-27</a>). Solomon acts in that priest-king pattern first hinted at in Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>) and ultimately fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; He &#8220;blessed them all,&#8221; leaving no tribe or individual out, echoing the covenant promise that Israel would be a channel through which &#8220;all the families of the earth will be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Moments later Solomon&#8217;s actual blessing begins: &#8220;Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with His hands has fulfilled what He promised&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-4.htm">2 Chronicles 6:4</a>). True blessing starts with praising God&#8217;s faithfulness and then overflows to the people (<a href="/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/6-3.htm">2 Chronicles 6:3</a> pictures an entire nation standing in unified reverence, a king who turns from the altar to face his people, and a comprehensive blessing that reaches every Israelite. The verse invites us to gather in wholehearted worship, recognize our Mediator, and receive God&#8217;s all-inclusive favor&#8212;so that His glory may spread to the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And the king.</span>--The verse is word for word as in Kings.<p><span class= "bld">Turned.</span>--<span class= "ital">Turned round</span> (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-14.htm" title="And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.">1Chronicles 10:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Stood.</span>--Was <span class= "ital">standing.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Reading between the lines, this verse shows us that the face of Solomon had been turned to the symbol of God's presence, while he addressed to him the words of our second verse, since he now faces round to the assembly of the congregation.
