In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the use of precious stones was often associated with royalty and divinity, signifying wealth, power, and beauty. The adornment of the temple with such stones reflects the glory and majesty of God, as well as the dedication of Solomon to create a dwelling place worthy of the Lord. This practice can be seen as a continuation of the tradition established in the tabernacle, where precious stones were used in the high priest's breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-20</a>). The beauty of the temple serves as a physical representation of the spiritual beauty and holiness of God.<p><b>and its gold was from Parvaim</b><br>The mention of Parvaim as the source of the gold used in the temple construction suggests a location known for its high-quality gold. While the exact location of Parvaim is uncertain, it is often thought to be a region in Arabia or possibly India, known for its rich gold deposits. The use of gold from Parvaim emphasizes the opulence and splendor of the temple, as gold was a symbol of purity and divine presence. In biblical symbolism, gold often represents the divine nature and kingship of Christ, as seen in the gifts brought by the Magi (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>). The use of gold in the temple not only signifies the wealth and resources available to Solomon but also points to the future glory of God's eternal kingdom, where the streets are described as being made of pure gold (<a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.
