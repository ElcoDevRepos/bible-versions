The temple, also known as the First Temple, was a central place of worship for the Israelites and symbolized God's presence among His people. Its construction was a fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The royal palace, on the other hand, served as the king's residence and a center of governance. The completion of these structures signifies a period of peace and stability in Israel, allowing Solomon to focus on spiritual and administrative leadership. Archaeological evidence suggests that such grand constructions were typical of ancient Near Eastern monarchs, reflecting their power and divine favor.<p><b>successfully carrying out all that was in his heart to do for the house of the LORD and for his own palace</b><br>This phrase highlights Solomon's dedication and commitment to fulfilling his God-given mission. The phrase "all that was in his heart" suggests that Solomon's intentions were aligned with God's will, as he sought to honor the Lord through the temple's construction. This reflects the biblical principle that God grants success to those who seek to fulfill His purposes (<a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>). The successful completion of these projects also demonstrates Solomon's wisdom and organizational skills, which were gifts from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>). The dual focus on both the temple and the palace indicates a balance between spiritual devotion and earthly responsibilities, a theme echoed in the New Testament where believers are called to seek first the kingdom of God while managing their earthly duties (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

The expressions that we have in this verse guide us amid some ambiguities to the correct date of the consecration of the temple. The verse purports to speak of the final completion the temple and the king's house or palace, with all whatsoever that was necessary to them in the matter of their furnishing. And, to say the least, the impression naturally produced on the reader is that they are spoken of as being <span class="accented">thus</span> completed simultaneously, although, beyond doubt, there was a sense in which the temple was (not utterly finished but) built long before the palace. Accordingly, when the next verse tells us of God's answer vouchsafed to the dedication prayer of Solomon, we <span class="cmt_word">are</span> not driven to the supposition that several years had elapsed since the final completion of the temple and the dedication of it on the one hand, nor, on the other hand, a similar interval lost between the dedication prayer and the Divine acknowledgment of it. It may be again stated that the main structure of the temple (not including courts, pillars, furnishing, vessels, etc.) was built after seven years' process, in the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, but the palace only after another complete twelve years (<a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>), in Solomon's twenty-fourth year. A liberal study of the parallel narrative of Kings in its entirety strengthens considerably this view, inasmuch as there the whole account of the palace-building finds its place previous to the account of the dedicating of the temple. However, though there can be little practical doubt as to how the facts of the case stood and stand, yet this occasion must count one to be added to the chronological memorabilia of Scripture, in that, while both the accounts to which we have access leave very vague the very things we should naturally expect to have been stated concisely, they also both seem entirely unconscious of it - a directest outcome of the fact that both writers were but picking their own way in the midst of borrowed material, neither of them the original historian. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/7-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Solomon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8010.htm">Strong's 8010: </a> </span><span class="str2">Solomon -- David's son and successor to his throne</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had finished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1447;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7733;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
