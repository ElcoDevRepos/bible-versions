The context is a battle between the forces of King Abijah of Judah and King Jeroboam of Israel. Judah finds itself surrounded, a tactical disadvantage indicating a dire situation. Historically, this reflects the divided kingdom period after Solomon's reign, where internal strife and external threats were common. The geographical setting is the hill country of Ephraim, a strategic location in ancient Israel. This moment of realization for Judah can be compared to other biblical instances where God's people faced overwhelming odds, such as the Israelites at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10</a>) or Gideon's battle against the Midianites (<a href="/judges/7-21.htm">Judges 7:21</a>).<p><b>they cried out to the LORD</b><br>The act of crying out to the LORD signifies a turning point, demonstrating reliance on divine intervention rather than human strength. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God's people call upon Him in times of distress (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>). It reflects a covenant relationship where God is seen as a deliverer. Theologically, this cry can be seen as an act of faith, acknowledging God's sovereignty and power to save. It also prefigures the New Testament call to prayer and dependence on God (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>).<p><b>Then the priests blew the trumpets</b><br>The blowing of trumpets by the priests is significant in Israelite worship and warfare. Trumpets were used to signal important events, such as the start of a battle or a call to worship (<a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9</a>). This act symbolizes divine presence and intervention, as the priests, representing God's covenant, lead the people in seeking His aid. Theologically, it underscores the role of worship and obedience in spiritual warfare. The trumpet is also a type of Christ, who will return with the sound of a trumpet (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>), signaling ultimate victory and deliverance for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

From a purely human perspective they are trapped&#8212;enemies ahead and behind. Yet Scripture consistently shows that apparent hopelessness is often God&#8217;s stage for displaying His power. Think of Israel hemmed in at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10&#8211;14</a>) or Elisha&#8217;s servant surrounded at Dothan until the LORD opened his eyes to the heavenly army (<a href="/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15&#8211;17</a>). The chronicler is inviting us to see this moment literally: Judah has no escape route. Theologically, it underscores that safety is never in superior tactics but in the LORD who &#8220;encamps around those who fear Him and delivers them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>).<p>Key observations:<p>&#8226; Their predicament is real, not symbolic&#8212;Scripture presents it as historical fact.<p>&#8226; The encirclement magnifies any deliverance that follows; God receives unmistakable glory.<p>&#8226; Believers today may feel similarly surrounded&#8212;family crises in front, financial pressure behind; the principle still stands that &#8220;the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They cried out to the LORD</b><p>Judah&#8217;s first response isn&#8217;t retreat or negotiation; it is a corporate cry to the covenant-keeping God. This fits the repeated biblical pattern: &#8220;Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>). Earlier generations had done the same&#8212;Israel under Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8&#8211;10</a>) and the tribes east of the Jordan when attacked (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-20.htm">1 Chronicles 5:20</a>). Abijah&#8217;s men voice dependency, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise that &#8220;the LORD your God goes with you to fight for you against your enemies&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>).<p>Points to note:<p>&#8226; The cry is immediate&#8212;no delay in turning to prayer, showing genuine faith.<p>&#8226; It is collective&#8212;the entire army joins, echoing future scenes like Jehoshaphat&#8217;s assembly (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; God hears; the next verses confirm He routes Israel (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-15.htm">2 Chronicles 13:15-18</a>). Literal history affirms the reliability of calling on Him today (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the priests blew the trumpets</b><p>The priests act in obedience to <a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9</a>: &#8220;When you enter into battle&#8230; sound a blast on the trumpets; then you will be remembered by the LORD your God and be saved from your enemies.&#8221; Abijah had already highlighted this ordinance (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>), so the trumpet blast signals confidence in God&#8217;s prescribed means. Trumpets announced divine intervention at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>) and will again herald the LORD&#8217;s future acts (<a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>). Here they rally Judah, remind the troops of God&#8217;s presence, and declare war under His banner.<p>Takeaways:<p>&#8226; Obedience to God&#8217;s revealed instructions precedes victory&#8212;faith is expressed through action.<p>&#8226; The priests&#8217; role illustrates that worship and warfare intertwine; spiritual leaders point people to dependence on God, not merely strategy.<p>&#8226; The literal trumpet blast in history foreshadows the ultimate triumph where God&#8217;s people will again hear celestial trumpets announcing final deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/13-14.htm">2 Chronicles 13:14</a> records a literal moment when Judah, surrounded by foes, relies wholly on the LORD. Realizing their vulnerability, they cry out, and the priests obey Scripture by sounding the battle trumpets. God responds with decisive deliverance, proving that when His people trust and act on His Word, He fights for them. The verse assures believers in every age that no encirclement is too tight for the LORD to break, and that faith expressed in prayerful obedience invites His saving power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And when Judah looked back, behold the battle was before and behind.</span>--Comp. the account of the ambuscade by which Ai was taken (Joshua , 8);
