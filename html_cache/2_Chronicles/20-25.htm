This event follows a divine intervention where God caused confusion among the enemy armies, leading them to destroy each other. The act of carrying off plunder was common in ancient warfare, symbolizing not only victory but also God's provision and blessing. This reflects the biblical principle that God fights for His people and rewards their faithfulness, as seen in other instances like the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>).<p><b>and they found on the bodies an abundance of goods and valuables</b><br>The abundance of goods and valuables signifies the wealth and resources that the enemy armies brought with them, expecting victory. This unexpected bounty underscores God's ability to provide for His people beyond their expectations. It also serves as a reminder of the futility of relying on material wealth and military might, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>, which states that victory comes from the Lord.<p><b>more than they could carry away</b><br>The phrase highlights the overwhelming nature of God's blessing. The plunder was so vast that it exceeded the capacity of Jehoshaphat and his people to transport it all at once. This echoes the biblical theme of God's provision being more than sufficient, as seen in the feeding of the 5,000 in the New Testament (<a href="/john/6-12.htm">John 6:12-13</a>), where the leftovers were more than what was initially available.<p><b>They were gathering the plunder for three days</b><br>The duration of three days is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness and divine perfection. This period allowed the people to fully appreciate the magnitude of God's deliverance and provision. The number three is frequently associated with resurrection and new beginnings, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>).<p><b>because there was so much</b><br>The sheer volume of the plunder emphasizes the extent of God's blessing and the totality of the victory He provided. It serves as a testament to God's faithfulness and power, reinforcing the message that when God intervenes, He does so abundantly. This abundance is a foretaste of the eternal blessings promised to believers, as described in <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>, where God is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who led his people in seeking the Lord's guidance and deliverance from their enemies.

(For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)">Judges 8:24-26</a> (the spoils of Midian). The amount of the spoil is explained by the circumstance that the invaders had intended to effect a permanent settlement in Judah, and so brought all their goods with them (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-11.htm" title="Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.">2Chronicles 20:11</a>). (Comp. <a href="/psalms/83-12.htm" title="Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.">Psalm 83:12</a>.) The invasion was thus similar in character to the migrations of the barbarian hordes, which broke repeatedly over the declining Roman empire, though of course it was on a much smaller scale. Its repulse, however, has proved not less momentous in the history of mankind, than that of the Persians at Marathon, or of the Saracens at Roncesvalles. The greatness of the overthrow may be inferred from the fact that the prophet Joel makes it a type of the coming judgment of Israel's enemies in the "Valley of Jehoshaphat"--a prophetic designation which alludes at once to the catastrophe recorded here, and to the truth that "Jehovah is judge" of all the earth (<a href="/joel/3-2.htm" title="I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.">Joel 3:2</a>; <a href="/joel/3-12.htm" title="Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.">Joel 3:12</a>; <a href="/joel/3-14.htm" title="Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.">Joel 3:14</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Both riches with the dead bodies</span>. The Hebrew text reads literally, <span class="accented">both riches and dead bodies</span> (no article). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of the text, however, appears in several ("old authorities," Revised Version) manuscripts, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> ("garments"), and the versions of both Septuagint and Vulgate lend their authority to this reading.

It is, however, a word of very generic quality, and is rendered as here "jewels" about twenty-five other times. It would seem nugatory to tell us that there were "dead bodies," in the bald rendering of "and dead bodies." Our Authorized Version rendering, "riches <span class="accented">with</span> the dead bodies," of course both ingeniously glosses the difficulty and makes a sufficiently good meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/20-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jehoshaphat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1443;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3092.htm">Strong's 3092: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoshaphat -- 'the LORD has judged', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;am&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
