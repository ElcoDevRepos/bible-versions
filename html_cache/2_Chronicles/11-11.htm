The strengthening of fortifications was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern military strategy, aimed at protecting against invasions. This action reflects Rehoboam's concern for the security of his kingdom, especially after the northern tribes broke away under Jeroboam. The fortification of cities is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where leaders prepared for potential threats, such as Nehemiah rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/4-6.htm">Nehemiah 4:6-23</a>).<p><b>and put officers in them</b><br>Rehoboam appointed military leaders or commanders over these fortified cities. This was a strategic move to ensure that each city had a responsible authority to manage its defenses and maintain order. The appointment of officers is similar to the organization seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as the appointment of judges and leaders by Moses (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>). It highlights the importance of leadership and governance in maintaining the stability and security of a nation.<p><b>with supplies of food, oil, and wine</b><br>Provisioning the fortified cities with essential supplies was crucial for sustaining them during sieges or times of conflict. Food, oil, and wine were staple commodities in the ancient Near East, necessary for the sustenance of both the military and civilian populations. This preparation reflects a prudent and foresighted approach to governance, ensuring that the cities could withstand prolonged periods of isolation. The mention of these supplies also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's provision, as seen in the story of Joseph storing grain in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48-49</a>) and the miraculous provision of oil and flour for the widow of Zarephath (<a href="/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, who is central to this passage.

The point: wise leaders secure what God has entrusted before a crisis hits.<p>&#8226; Nehemiah followed the same pattern, setting families &#8220;by their clans, with their swords, spears, and bows&#8221; while rebuilding the wall (<a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13&#8211;14</a>). Faith trusts God but also prepares diligently.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and put officers in them</b><p>&#8226; Fortified walls are only as effective as the people who man them. Rehoboam appointed &#8220;officers,&#8221; seasoned commanders responsible for each city&#8217;s readiness.<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat later followed suit, stationing &#8220;troops in all the fortified cities of Judah&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a>,14&#8211;19). Leadership structure ensures discipline, communication, and swift response.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s kingdom thrived under clear military oversight as &#8220;Joab was over the army&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15&#8211;16</a>). God&#8217;s orderliness in leadership safeguards His people from chaos.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with supplies of food, oil, and wine</b><p>&#8226; Rehoboam stocked essentials&#8212;grain for daily sustenance, oil for cooking and light, wine for health and morale (cf. <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). A well-provisioned fortress can endure siege and maintain hope.<p>&#8226; Joseph stored grain during Egypt&#8217;s seven years of plenty so the nation could survive famine (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48&#8211;49</a>). Foresight honors God and protects households.<p>&#8226; Hezekiah later &#8220;stopped the springs&#8221; and &#8220;built up the wall&#8221; while gathering &#8220;a great number of shields and spears&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3&#8211;5</a>). Material preparation remains a recurring biblical theme.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/11-11.htm">2 Chronicles 11:11</a> records Rehoboam&#8217;s threefold strategy: reinforce the walls, appoint capable leaders, and stock ample provisions. Each step reflects prudence anchored in trust: God gives promises, yet He also calls His people to strengthen what is weak, establish accountable leadership, and steward resources wisely. The verse reminds believers that faith and practical preparation walk hand in hand, securing God&#8217;s blessings for the challenges ahead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And he fortified.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">strengthened, i.e.,</span> put them in an efficient condition for defence, by providing commandants and stores of arms and food.<p><span class= "bld">The strong holds.</span>--<span class= "ital">Mets-roth;</span> the word in last verse.<p><span class= "bld">Captains.</span>--<span class= "ital">Negidim;</span> leaders, princes (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-11.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;">1Chronicles 9:11</a>).
