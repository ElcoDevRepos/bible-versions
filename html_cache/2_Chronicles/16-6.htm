This phrase highlights his leadership and ability to mobilize the people of Judah for a significant task. Asa's reign is marked by a commitment to the worship of Yahweh, and he often sought to remove idolatry from the land. The gathering of all the men of Judah indicates a united effort, reflecting Asa's influence and the loyalty of his subjects.<p><b>and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had used for building</b><br>Ramah was a strategic city located near the border of the northern kingdom of Israel and Judah. King Baasha of Israel had fortified Ramah to control access to Judah, effectively blockading Asa's kingdom. The removal of these materials signifies a reversal of Baasha's aggressive actions and a victory for Asa. The stones and timbers represent not only physical resources but also the dismantling of a threat to Judah's security. This act can be seen as a fulfillment of Asa's reliance on divine intervention, as he had previously sought the help of the Arameans to divert Baasha's attention.<p><b>And with these materials he built up Geba and Mizpah</b><br>Geba and Mizpah were towns in the territory of Benjamin, close to the border with Israel. By fortifying these locations, Asa strengthened Judah's defenses against future incursions. Geba, often associated with the Levitical cities, and Mizpah, a site of significant historical and religious events, were strategically important. Mizpah, in particular, was a place where Israel gathered for important assemblies and where Samuel judged the people. Asa's actions here not only secured his kingdom but also demonstrated a strategic use of resources to bolster Judah's military and spiritual fortifications. This move reflects a broader biblical theme of using what the enemy intended for harm to bring about good, a principle seen throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_asa.htm">King Asa</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during a time of both religious reform and military conflict.

Asa summons every able man, signaling national unity and urgency. Earlier, Asa had trusted in the LORD against Zerah&#8217;s million-man army (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-13</a>), but in this chapter he wrongly sought Syria&#8217;s help against Baasha (16:1-3). Even so, the king still mobilizes his own people when the opportunity to act arises. Similar calls to gather appear when Jehoshaphat faced invasion (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-4.htm">2 Chronicles 20:4</a>) and when Nehemiah rallied builders for Jerusalem&#8217;s wall (<a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-14</a>). In each case, righteous purposes call God&#8217;s people into cooperative action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They carried away the stones of Ramah</b><p>Ramah, only five miles north of Jerusalem, had been fortified by Baasha to choke Judah&#8217;s access to trade and travel (<a href="/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>). By seizing the building materials, Asa does more than remove a military threat; he turns the enemy&#8217;s investment to Judah&#8217;s benefit. This reversal echoes how Israel plundered Egypt&#8217;s wealth at the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>) and how David used Goliath&#8217;s own sword (<a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>). God often causes what was meant for harm to become a blessing for His people (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the timbers Baasha had used for building</b><p>Timber was valuable and scarce in Judah, normally imported from Lebanon (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>). By reclaiming Baasha&#8217;s lumber, Asa conserves resources and demonstrates stewardship&#8212;making the most of what God provides (<a href="/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a>). The act also serves as a visible sign that Israel&#8217;s aggression has been thwarted; every beam carted southward testifies to Judah&#8217;s deliverance, similar to how the Philistines&#8217; captured idols were displayed in David&#8217;s triumph (<a href="/2_samuel/5-21.htm">2 Samuel 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With these materials he built up Geba and Mizpah</b><p>Geba lay on Judah&#8217;s northern frontier (<a href="/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>) and Mizpah a little farther west (<a href="/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>). Fortifying both towns creates a defensive line where Baasha&#8217;s Ramah once threatened. Asa transforms a point of vulnerability into strengthened security, paralleling Solomon&#8217;s strategic building projects (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-5.htm">2 Chronicles 8:5-6</a>). Spiritually, the pattern reflects <a href="/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a>&#8212;resist the enemy and reinforce weak places&#8212;turning former strongholds of opposition into bulwarks for God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/16-6.htm">2 Chronicles 16:6</a> portrays Asa reclaiming and re-purposing the enemy&#8217;s resources to secure Judah&#8217;s borders. The verse highlights leadership that unifies God&#8217;s people, the LORD&#8217;s ability to reverse hostile intentions, wise stewardship of provisions, and the importance of fortifying vulnerable areas. Though Asa&#8217;s earlier reliance on Syria was faithless, this action illustrates how God can still bring practical victories when His people act decisively and redirect what once endangered them into assets for His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Then.</span>--<span class= "ital">And.</span><p><span class= "bld">Asa the king took all Judah.</span>--<a href="/1_kings/15-22.htm" title="Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.">1Kings 15:22</a> : "And the king Asa called together all Judah; none was exempted."

The parallel (<a href="/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>)is so much the more graphic that it contains the two additions that Asa "made a proclamation throughout all Judah," and one that "exempted none" from joining in the duty of moving all the stones and all the timber from Ramah, and diverting' them to the use of building Geba and Mizpah. This greatly contributed to command the road from the north to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Geba</span>. This was Geba of Benjamin, as clearly stated in the parallel. It was a position north of Ramah, whether opposite Michmash and the modern Jeba is not certain, as some think this answers to Gibeah of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mizpah</span> (see <a href="/jeremiah/41-2.htm">Jeremiah 41:2, 3, 9, 10</a>).
