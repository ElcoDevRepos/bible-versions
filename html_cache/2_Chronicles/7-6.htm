These instruments are not for entertainment; they belong to &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; signaling that every note is an offering. Worship today may look different, yet music remains a holy tool to magnify God (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD</b><p>David prepared these instruments decades earlier (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>); Solomon now uses them, proving that God-inspired legacy outlives the original builder (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). Thanksgiving is their primary purpose (<a href="/psalms/92-1.htm">Psalm 92:1-3</a>). Gratitude is not an add-on in worship&#8212;it is central.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and with which David had offered praise</b><p>David personally modeled worship on these very instruments (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-15</a>). His example still echoes: leaders ignite worship by participating, not merely delegating (<a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1-3</a>). Solomon&#8217;s generation inherits both the hardware and the heart behind it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying, &#8220;For His loving devotion endures forever.&#8221;</b><p>This timeless chorus, repeated in <a href="/bsb/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a> and at the ark&#8217;s earlier arrival (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-34.htm">1 Chronicles 16:34</a>), celebrates God&#8217;s covenant love (<a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>). The refrain anchors every sacrifice and song in God&#8217;s unchanging mercy, reminding Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that worship is a response to grace, not a means to earn it (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Across from the Levites, the priests sounded trumpets</b><p>Trumpets announce God&#8217;s presence and summon the people (<a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12-13</a>). Their blasts weave with the Levites&#8217; melodies, portraying unity of word and music, priests and singers, sacrifice and praise. This balance guards worship from becoming either dry ritual or emotion without truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the Israelites were standing.</b><p>The entire nation participates (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10-13</a>). Standing signals reverence (<a href="/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5</a>), readiness, and agreement. No spectator spirit is allowed; everyone is summoned to honor the Lord together (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot of corporate worship at Solomon&#8217;s temple dedication: priests steady at their posts, Levites leading with instruments crafted by David, an ancient refrain extolling God&#8217;s steadfast love, trumpets heralding His presence, and the whole congregation standing in reverent unity. The verse highlights orderly service, intergenerational faithfulness, music&#8217;s sacred role, gratitude as the heartbeat of worship, and full participation by God&#8217;s people. It calls believers today to stand ready, praise wholeheartedly, and remember that the God whose loving devotion endures forever is still worthy of such devoted, unified worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And the priests.</span>--This verse is added by the chronicler, after his usual fashion of laying stress on the ritual, especially its choral and musical side.
