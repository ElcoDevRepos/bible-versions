Hezekiah's reign was marked by a return to the worship of Yahweh and the removal of idolatrous practices. The "all this" indicates a significant period of religious revival and reform, emphasizing the importance of communal worship and obedience to God's commandments.<p><b>the Israelites in attendance went out to the cities of Judah</b><br>The Israelites mentioned here include those from the northern kingdom who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover. This gathering signifies a moment of unity among the divided tribes of Israel and Judah. The cities of Judah were the primary locations where these reforms were enacted, highlighting the centrality of Judah in the religious life of the Israelites.<p><b>and broke up the sacred pillars</b><br>Sacred pillars, or standing stones, were often associated with Canaanite religious practices and idolatry. The breaking of these pillars symbolizes the rejection of foreign gods and a return to the worship of Yahweh. This act of destruction was a physical manifestation of spiritual renewal and obedience to the first commandment.<p><b>chopped down the Asherah poles</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah. The removal of these poles was a direct command from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>) and represented a cleansing of the land from pagan influences. This action underscores the importance of purity in worship and the rejection of syncretism.<p><b>and tore down the high places and altars throughout Judah and Benjamin</b><br>High places were local worship sites often used for idolatrous practices. The destruction of these sites was a significant step in centralizing worship in Jerusalem, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>. The mention of Benjamin alongside Judah indicates the extent of Hezekiah's reforms and the inclusion of all tribes in the covenant community.<p><b>as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh</b><br>Ephraim and Manasseh were tribes from the northern kingdom of Israel. Their inclusion in this reform effort highlights the reach of Hezekiah's influence and the desire for national spiritual renewal. This action also foreshadows the eventual reunification of Israel under a single king, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15-28</a>.<p><b>until they had utterly destroyed them all</b><br>The complete destruction of these idolatrous sites signifies total commitment to the covenant with Yahweh. This thoroughness reflects the biblical principle of removing sin completely from one's life, as partial obedience is not sufficient in the eyes of God.<p><b>Then all the Israelites returned to their cities, each to his own property</b><br>After the reforms, the Israelites returned to their daily lives, suggesting a restoration of order and peace. This return to their own property symbolizes the blessings of obedience and the restoration of God's favor upon the land. It also reflects the biblical theme of rest and inheritance, as seen in the promises given to the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who participated in the religious reforms led by King Hezekiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_judah.htm">Cities of Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where the reforms were primarily focused.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_pillars_and_asherah_poles.htm">Sacred Pillars and Asherah Poles</a></b><br>Objects of pagan worship that were destroyed as part of the religious reforms.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places_and_altars.htm">High Places and Altars</a></b><br>Sites of unauthorized worship that were demolished to centralize worship in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim_and_manasseh.htm">Ephraim and Manasseh</a></b><br>Tribes of Israel in the northern kingdom, indicating the widespread impact of the reforms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_purity.htm">Commitment to Purity</a></b><br>The Israelites' actions demonstrate a commitment to spiritual purity by removing all forms of idolatry.
