In the ancient Near Eastern context, it was common for new kings to eliminate all potential threats, including the families of their enemies. Amaziah's choice reflects a departure from this norm, indicating a commitment to justice and the laws of God rather than human tradition or political expediency.<p><b>but acted according to what is written in the Law</b><br>Amaziah's actions are guided by adherence to the Mosaic Law, demonstrating his respect for divine commandments over cultural practices. This obedience to the Law is a recurring theme in the history of Israel's kings, where blessings and curses are often tied to their faithfulness to God's commands.<p><b>in the Book of Moses</b><br>The reference to the "Book of Moses" underscores the authority of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament, as the foundation of Israelite law and religious practice. This highlights the importance of Scripture as the ultimate guide for moral and legal decisions, a principle that remains central in Christian theology.<p><b>where the LORD commanded</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the law, reinforcing the belief that the commandments are not merely human constructs but are given by God Himself. This divine authority is crucial for understanding the weight and significance of the laws in the life of Israel and their leaders.<p><b>&#8220;Fathers must not be put to death for their children, and children must not be put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.&#8221;</b><br>This command is found in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a> and reflects the principle of individual responsibility for sin, a concept that is echoed throughout Scripture. It contrasts with the collective punishment often seen in other ancient cultures. This principle is also seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, reinforcing the idea that each person is accountable to God for their own actions.
