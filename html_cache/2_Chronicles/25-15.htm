The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting from idolatry or disobedience to His commandments. In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/25.htm">2 Chronicles 25</a>, Amaziah had turned to the gods of the Edomites after defeating them, which was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This reflects a pattern seen throughout Israel's history, where leaders and people often fell into idolatry, provoking God's wrath (<a href="/judges/2-12.htm">Judges 2:12-14</a>).<p><b>and He sent him a prophet</b><br>God's sending of a prophet signifies His mercy and desire for repentance. Prophets in the Old Testament served as God's messengers, calling His people back to faithfulness. This action demonstrates God's willingness to warn and correct His people before executing judgment. Prophets like Nathan (2 Samuel 12) and Elijah (1 Kings 18) played similar roles in confronting kings and calling them to repentance.<p><b>who said, &#8220;Why have you sought this people&#8217;s gods</b><br>The prophet's question highlights the futility and irrationality of Amaziah's actions. The Edomites' gods were powerless, as evidenced by their inability to protect their own people. This rhetorical question underscores the absurdity of turning to false gods when the true God had just granted victory. It echoes the folly of idolatry condemned in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the prophet mocks the creation and worship of idols.<p><b>which could not deliver them from your hand?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the impotence of the Edomite gods. Despite their worship, these gods could not save the Edomites from defeat. This serves as a reminder of the sovereignty and power of the LORD, who alone is able to deliver and save. The contrast between the living God and lifeless idols is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the story of Elijah and the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-20.htm">1 Kings 18:20-40</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who triumphs over all spiritual powers (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the Lord but later turned to idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose anger was kindled against Amaziah for his idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet.htm">Prophet</a></b><br>An unnamed messenger sent by God to confront Amaziah about his idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gods_of_edom.htm">Gods of Edom</a></b><br>The false gods that Amaziah worshipped after defeating the Edomites, leading to his downfall.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation defeated by Amaziah, whose gods he foolishly adopted.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but can be anything that takes the place of God in our lives.
