The men who came to him were likely scouts or messengers, a common practice in ancient times to gather intelligence about enemy movements. This reflects the importance of communication and vigilance in leadership.<p><b>A vast army is coming against you</b><br>The phrase "vast army" indicates a significant threat, suggesting a coalition of forces. This would have been a cause for alarm, as large armies were often devastating in their campaigns. The threat to Judah was not just military but also spiritual, as it tested the nation's faith and reliance on God.<p><b>From Edom</b><br>Edom was a neighboring nation to the southeast of Judah, often in conflict with Israel and Judah. The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, which adds a layer of familial tension to their historical conflicts. This reference highlights the ongoing enmity between the descendants of Jacob and Esau.<p><b>From beyond the Sea</b><br>The "Sea" here refers to the Dead Sea, which lies to the east of Judah. This geographical marker indicates the direction from which the threat is approaching. The Dead Sea region was a natural barrier, making any military movement from that direction noteworthy.<p><b>They are already in Hazazon-tamar</b><br>Hazazon-tamar is another name for En-gedi, an oasis on the western shore of the Dead Sea. This location is significant because it was a strategic point, providing water and shelter in an otherwise arid region. The presence of the enemy here suggests they were well-prepared and advancing quickly.<p><b>(that is, En-gedi)</b><br>En-gedi is known for its lush vegetation and springs, a stark contrast to the surrounding desert. It was a place of refuge for David when he fled from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/23-29.htm">1 Samuel 23:29</a>). The mention of En-gedi connects this event to the broader biblical narrative of God's deliverance and protection, as seen in David's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.

The detail-laden warning spotlights Judah&#8217;s absolute need for divine rescue and prepares readers for the Lord&#8217;s miraculous deliverance that follows&#8212;affirming once more that &#8220;the battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Then there came some that told.</span>--<span class= "ital">And they </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> messengers; Vulg., "nuntii") <span class= "ital">came and told.</span><p><span class= "bld">Cometh.</span>--<span class= "ital">Is come.</span><p><span class= "bld">The Sea.</span>--The Dead Sea, east of which lay the territories of Ammon and Moab; while to the south of it, not far from Petra, was Maon.<p><span class= "bld">On this side Syria.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">from Aram;</span> and so LXX. and Vulg.
