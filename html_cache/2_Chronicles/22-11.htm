Her lineage placed her in a unique position within the royal family, giving her access and influence. Her actions are significant in the preservation of the Davidic line, which is crucial for the fulfillment of messianic prophecies.<p><b>took Joash son of Ahaziah</b><br>Joash was the rightful heir to the throne of Judah, being the son of King Ahaziah. His survival was essential for the continuation of the Davidic dynasty, which had been promised an eternal throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). Joash's preservation is a testament to God's faithfulness to His covenant with David.<p><b>and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were being murdered</b><br>Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, sought to destroy all the royal heirs to secure her own power. This act of violence was a direct threat to the Davidic line. Jehoshabeath's intervention was a courageous and strategic move to protect Joash from the massacre orchestrated by Athaliah.<p><b>and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom</b><br>The act of hiding Joash in a bedroom suggests a place of safety and concealment within the palace. This location would have been familiar and accessible to Jehoshabeath, allowing her to protect Joash without arousing suspicion. The presence of a nurse indicates the care and provision for Joash during his concealment.<p><b>Because Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest</b><br>Jehoshabeath's marriage to Jehoiada, the high priest, is significant. It highlights the alliance between the royal family and the priesthood, which played a crucial role in the preservation and eventual restoration of the Davidic line. Jehoiada's influence and position would later be instrumental in Joash's ascension to the throne.<p><b>was Ahaziah&#8217;s sister</b><br>This familial relationship underscores Jehoshabeath's motivation to save Joash. As Ahaziah's sister, she had a vested interest in the survival of her brother's lineage. Her actions were not only politically motivated but also driven by familial loyalty and a sense of divine purpose.<p><b>she hid Joash from Athaliah so that she could not kill him</b><br>Athaliah's intent to kill all potential heirs was a direct challenge to God's covenant with David. Jehoshabeath's successful concealment of Joash thwarted Athaliah's plans and ensured the continuation of the Davidic line. This act of preservation is a foreshadowing of God's ultimate protection and fulfillment of His promises, culminating in the birth of Jesus Christ, the true heir of David's throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehosheba.htm">Jehosheba</a></b><br>Daughter of King Jehoram, sister of King Ahaziah, and wife of Jehoiada the priest.
