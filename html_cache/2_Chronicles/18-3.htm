Ahab, a king known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel, seeks an alliance with Jehoshaphat, a king noted for his faithfulness to God. This request for military alliance reflects the ongoing tension and occasional cooperation between the two kingdoms. Historically, such alliances were common to strengthen military power against common enemies. Theologically, this interaction sets the stage for examining the consequences of aligning with ungodly leadership.<p><b>&#8220;Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?&#8221;</b><br>Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River, in the territory of Gilead. It was a Levitical city and a city of refuge, indicating its significance in Israelite society. The city had been contested between Israel and Aram (Syria), and Ahab's desire to reclaim it underscores the ongoing conflict with Aram. This request for military support also reflects the broader theme of territorial disputes in the ancient Near East. Biblically, this sets the stage for the prophetic intervention of Micaiah, who warns against the campaign.<p><b>And Jehoshaphat replied, &#8220;I am as you are, and my people are your people; we will join you in the war.&#8221;</b><br>Jehoshaphat's response indicates a willingness to form a political and military alliance, despite the spiritual and moral differences between the two kings. This reflects the cultural practice of forming alliances for mutual benefit, but it also raises questions about the wisdom of such partnerships. Theologically, this decision is significant because it demonstrates the potential pitfalls of compromising with ungodly influences, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, which warns against being unequally yoked with unbelievers. Jehoshaphat's alliance with Ahab ultimately leads to negative consequences, illustrating the importance of seeking God's guidance in decision-making.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and wickedness, married to Jezebel.

Here their two reigning kings meet in Samaria (2 Chron 18:2).<p>&#8226; Ahab&#8217;s idolatry and political compromises are well known (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30&#8211;33</a>), while Jehoshaphat has just been commended for seeking the Lord (2 Chron 17:3&#8211;6). The verse therefore opens with a spiritually mixed alliance: a faithful king listening to an unfaithful one.<p>&#8226; Scripture elsewhere warns against unequal partnerships that can sway God-fearing people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).

Ahab frames the campaign as reclaiming rightful Israelite territory.<p>&#8226; The request sounds patriotic, yet Ahab&#8217;s underlying goal is personal security (<a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>). What appears strategic can hide self-interest when a leader&#8217;s heart is not aligned with God (<a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The question tests Jehoshaphat&#8217;s discernment: will he seek divine counsel first (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>), or will he be swayed by political pressure?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And Jehoshaphat replied&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat responds quickly, without first inquiring of the Lord.

Jehoshaphat&#8217;s later rebuke by the prophet Jehu&#8212;&#8220;Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD?&#8221; (2 Chron 19:2)&#8212;traces back to this moment.<p>&#8226; The narrative reminds us that even sincere believers can misstep when they neglect immediate dependence on God&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am as you are, and my people are your people&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat emphasizes kinship, recalling Israel&#8217;s shared ancestry through Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet spiritual unity must override mere blood ties; <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a> asks, &#8220;Can two walk together unless they are agreed?&#8221; By aligning too closely with Ahab, Jehoshaphat blurs the line between covenant faithfulness and political unity.<p>&#8226; Believers today face similar pressures to downplay doctrinal distinctives for the sake of cultural harmony (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;we will join you in the war.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; A firm pledge&#8212;military, economic, and manpower support.

Ignoring prophetic truth invites divine discipline (<a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s later reforms (2 Chron 19:4&#8211;11) show that failure is not final; God uses consequences to refine His people (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/18-3.htm">2 Chronicles 18:3</a> captures a faithful king&#8217;s hasty commitment to an unfaithful ally. Ahab&#8217;s invitation seems politically reasonable, yet Jehoshaphat&#8217;s quick agreement&#8212;&#8220;I am as you are&#8230;we will join you&#8221;&#8212;reveals the danger of partnerships that neglect God&#8217;s counsel. The verse warns against compromising conviction for unity, reminds us to seek the Lord before making alliances, and illustrates how even well-intentioned believers face consequences when they align with the ungodly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And Ahab king of Israel.</span>--This verse is essentially the same as <a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm" title="And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.">1Kings 22:4</a>. From this point the two narratives practically coincide. (See the Notes on 1 Kings 22)<p><span class= "bld">To Ramoth-gilead</span>--i.e., Ramoth of, or in, Gilead.

Whether on the one occasion or the other, it is quite possible that Jehoshaphat thought he was serving common interests, and the cause of his own kingdom, as well as of Israel; nevertheless "Jehu the son of Hanani the seer" ignores the supposed justification (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/18-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ahab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7717;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_256.htm">Strong's 256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahab -- 'father's brother', a king of Israel, also a false prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1436;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
