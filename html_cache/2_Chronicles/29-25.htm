The Levites were members of the tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties, particularly in the temple. The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. This act of stationing the Levites signifies a return to the divinely ordained order of worship, emphasizing the importance of the temple as the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.<p><b>with cymbals, harps, and lyres</b><br>These musical instruments were integral to the worship practices in the temple. Cymbals, harps, and lyres were used in various ceremonies and were part of the Levitical duties. The use of music in worship is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting the role of music in expressing praise and adoration to God. This practice can be traced back to King David, who organized the temple musicians and established the use of these instruments in worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>).<p><b>according to the command of David</b><br>King David, known as a man after God's own heart, was instrumental in organizing the temple worship and establishing the roles of the Levites. His command regarding the use of music in worship was rooted in his own experiences and revelations from God. David's influence on temple worship set a precedent that was followed by subsequent generations, including Hezekiah's reforms.<p><b>of Gad the king&#8217;s seer</b><br>Gad was a prophet and seer during the time of David. As a seer, Gad had the ability to receive divine revelations and guidance, which he communicated to the king. His role in advising David on matters of worship and temple service underscores the importance of prophetic insight in establishing and maintaining proper worship practices.<p><b>and of Nathan the prophet</b><br>Nathan was another prophet during David's reign, known for his role in confronting David about his sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12). Nathan's involvement in the command regarding temple worship highlights the collaborative effort between the king and the prophets in ensuring that worship was conducted according to God's will. Prophets like Nathan played a crucial role in guiding the kings and the people in spiritual matters.<p><b>For the command had come from the LORD through His prophets</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the instructions for temple worship. The prophets served as God's mouthpieces, conveying His commands to the leaders and the people. The involvement of multiple prophets, such as Gad and Nathan, in delivering this command underscores the importance of prophetic authority and the need for adherence to God's directives in worship. This divine command reflects God's desire for order and reverence in worship, as well as the centrality of the temple in the spiritual life of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

Levites</b><p>Hezekiah&#8217;s first practical move in restoring true worship was to put the right people in the right place.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-2.htm">2 Chronicles 29:2</a> notes he &#8220;did what was right in the sight of the LORD,&#8221; so his actions here flow from a heart already aligned with God.<p>&#8226; By stationing Levites&#8212;men God had already set apart for temple service (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>)&#8212;Hezekiah honors the original order God gave through Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment mirrors other reforming kings who re-established proper roles (see <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a> under Josiah).<p>Meaning: Revival begins with returning to God&#8217;s appointed structure; spiritual zeal is anchored in obedience, not innovation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the house of the LORD</b><p>Hezekiah&#8217;s focus is the temple, God&#8217;s chosen earthly dwelling.<p>&#8226; Solomon had prayed that God&#8217;s Name would be there forever (<a href="/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a>,29).<p>&#8226; The Levites&#8217; positions remind Judah that worship is God-centered and temple-focused (<a href="/psalms/84-1.htm">Psalm 84:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Neglect of the temple had marked previous apostasy (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">2 Chronicles 28:24-25</a>), so reopening and repopulating it signals national repentance.<p>Meaning: Genuine reform restores God to the center; worship thrives where God has placed His Name.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with cymbals, harps, and lyres</b><p>The instruments matter because they underscore joyful, ordered praise.<p>&#8226; David first appointed these instruments when he brought the ark to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>; 16:4-6).<p>&#8226; Their use here links Hezekiah&#8217;s revival to Israel&#8217;s golden age of worship under David.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a> celebrates such instruments, showing God delights in vibrant, skillful praise.<p>Meaning: Worship that pleases God engages both heart and artistry; beauty in music reflects the beauty of the God we praise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to the command of David, of Gad the king&#8217;s seer, and of Nathan the prophet</b><p>Hezekiah isn&#8217;t

Samuel 7:2-3</a>) about worship arrangements.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a> says David acted &#8220;by the hand of the LORD upon me,&#8221; underscoring divine origin.<p>&#8226; Linking David with prophets highlights that even a king submits to God&#8217;s revealed will.<p>Meaning: True authority for worship comes from God&#8217;s Word, not human preference; leaders must follow prophetic revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the command had come from the LORD through His prophets</b><p>The narrator anchors everything in God Himself.<p>&#8226; Prophets were &#8220;men moved by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>), so their instructions carry God&#8217;s weight.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s pattern for worship was not cultural but covenantal&#8212;rooted in His unchanging nature (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience to prophetic command brings blessing (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-12.htm">2 Chronicles 30:12</a>), while neglect invites judgment (<a href="/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12-15</a>).<p>Meaning: Worship is not ours to redesign; it is God&#8217;s gift, revealed through His Word, and our role is humble obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a> shows Hezekiah faithfully restoring Davidic, prophetically sanctioned worship. He places consecrated Levites in God&#8217;s house, employs instruments God once approved through David, Gad, and Nathan, and does so because the LORD Himself commanded it. The verse teaches that revival blossoms when God&#8217;s people return to His revealed pattern&#8212;honoring His appointed servants, His sacred space, and His joyful sounds&#8212;affirming that authentic worship is always a response of obedient faith to the living, speaking God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">He set.</span>--<span class= "ital">Stationed, appointed.</span> Hezekiah restored the ancient choral worship as established by David (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-5.htm" title="Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.">1Chronicles 23:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-25.htm" title="For David said, The LORD God of Israel has given rest to his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:">1Chronicles 23:25</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Psalteries.</span>--<span class= "ital">N?b?lim,</span> a kind of harp; Greek, <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>. <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Harps.</span>--<span class= "ital">Kinnoroth.</span> Greek, <span class= "greekheb">??????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> a sort of lyre, or cittern, or guitar.<p><span class= "bld">Gad</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "bld">Nathan.</span>--<a href="/1_chronicles/29-29.htm" title="Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,">1Chronicles 29:29</a>. This is the only place where the institution of the Levitical minstrelsy is ascribed to the injunctions of prophets; but the thing is probable in itself, considering that no important step, whether in civil or ecclesiastical matters, would be likely to be taken by an Israelite king without consulting the Divine will by means of the royal prophets, as we know, from the cuneiform documents, was the uniform practice with the Assyrian and Babylonian sovereigns. Moreover, prophecy was intimately connected with music.
