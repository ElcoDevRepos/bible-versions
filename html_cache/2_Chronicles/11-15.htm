By appointing his own priests, he directly violated the Levitical priesthood established by God through Moses (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). This act was a political move to consolidate his power and prevent the people from returning to Jerusalem to worship, which could have led to a reunification under Rehoboam, king of Judah. Jeroboam's actions reflect a disregard for the divine order and a prioritization of political expediency over spiritual fidelity.<p><b>for the high places</b><br>High places were elevated sites often used for worship in ancient Israel and surrounding regions. While some high places were initially used for the worship of Yahweh, they became associated with idolatry and pagan practices over time (<a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2-3</a>). Jeroboam's establishment of high places was a direct challenge to the centralization of worship in Jerusalem, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>. This decentralization led to syncretism and the dilution of pure worship, contributing to the spiritual decline of the northern kingdom.<p><b>and for the goat demons</b><br>The reference to goat demons, or "se'irim" in Hebrew, indicates the worship of demonic entities associated with the wilderness and desolation (<a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>). This practice was likely influenced by surrounding pagan cultures, such as the Egyptians and Canaanites, who worshipped similar entities. The worship of goat demons represents a departure from monotheism and a return to the animistic and polytheistic practices that God had explicitly forbidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>). This idolatry was a spiritual corruption that led the people away from the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<p><b>and calf idols he had made</b><br>Jeroboam's creation of calf idols was a deliberate act of idolatry, reminiscent of the golden calf made by Aaron in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>. These idols were likely intended to represent Yahweh in a tangible form, but they violated the commandment against making graven images (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). The calves were placed in Bethel and Dan, strategically located at the southern and northern ends of his kingdom, to provide convenient worship sites and discourage pilgrimages to Jerusalem. This act of idolatry set a precedent for future kings of Israel and was a significant factor in the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, who is central to the events of this chapter.
