Asa was known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/14.htm">2 Chronicles 14-16</a>. This phrase highlights the importance of generational faithfulness and the impact of a godly legacy. Asa's reign was marked by a return to the worship of Yahweh, and Jehoshaphat's adherence to his father's ways suggests a continuation of these reforms. This continuity is significant in the context of the divided kingdom, where the northern kingdom of Israel often strayed from the worship of the true God.<p><b>and did not turn away from it;</b><br>Jehoshaphat's steadfastness in following Asa's path indicates his commitment to maintaining the religious purity and reforms initiated by his father. This phrase underscores the theme of perseverance in faith and obedience, which is a recurring motif in the Old Testament. The idea of not turning away is reminiscent of the exhortations found in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32-33</a>, where the Israelites are commanded to walk in the ways of the LORD without deviation. Jehoshaphat's consistency in his faithfulness serves as a model for believers to remain steadfast in their devotion to God.<p><b>he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.</b><br>This phrase is a common biblical expression used to describe the actions of kings who were faithful to God's commandments. It signifies divine approval and aligns Jehoshaphat with other righteous kings like David and Hezekiah. Doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD involves adherence to the covenant, promoting justice, and leading the people in true worship. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's desire for His people to live in righteousness and justice, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. Jehoshaphat's reign is characterized by efforts to educate the people in the Law of the LORD (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7-9</a>), further illustrating his commitment to righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's father, who was also a king of Judah and known for his dedication to God, though he faltered later in his reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jehoshaphat reigned, known for its capital, Jerusalem, and the temple of the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the central figure in the religious life of Judah and Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_way.htm">The Way</a></b><br>Refers to the path or manner of life that is in accordance with God's commandments and statutes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_leadership.htm">Faithfulness in Leadership</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's commitment to walking in the ways of his father Asa demonstrates the importance of faithfulness in leadership.
