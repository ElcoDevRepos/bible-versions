The use of "proclamation" suggests an official decree, likely delivered by heralds or through public readings. Judah and Jerusalem were the central regions of the Southern Kingdom, with Jerusalem being the political and spiritual center. This proclamation reflects the centralized authority of the king and the high priest, emphasizing the importance of the message. Historically, proclamations were a common method for disseminating important information to the populace, ensuring that everyone was aware of their obligations.<p><b>that they were to bring to the LORD</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the religious nature of the proclamation. The act of bringing something to the LORD signifies an offering or a contribution dedicated to God. In the context of ancient Israel, such acts were integral to worship and covenantal faithfulness. The phrase highlights the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where religious duties were intertwined with civic responsibilities. It also reflects the understanding that all offerings were ultimately for the LORD, reinforcing the idea of divine ownership and stewardship.<p><b>the tax imposed by Moses the servant of God</b><br>This refers to the specific tax or contribution that Moses, as God's appointed leader, established during the wilderness period. The mention of Moses as "the servant of God" emphasizes his authoritative role in delivering God's commands to the people. This tax is likely the half-shekel offering described in <a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>, which was used for the maintenance of the tabernacle and later the temple. It served as a means of atonement and a reminder of the people's covenant relationship with God. The reference to Moses connects the current practice to the foundational period of Israel's history, legitimizing the tax as a divinely ordained requirement.<p><b>on Israel in the wilderness</b><br>This phrase situates the origin of the tax during the wilderness period, a formative time for the nation of Israel. The wilderness journey was a time of testing, instruction, and covenant formation, as recorded in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. By recalling this period, the text reminds the people of their shared history and identity as God's chosen people. It also serves as a call to faithfulness, urging them to adhere to the practices established by their ancestors. The wilderness setting is symbolic of reliance on God and the journey towards the Promised Land, themes that resonate throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the restoration of the temple.
