The Edomites were descendants of Esau and often in conflict with Israel and Judah. This victory might have been seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over their enemies, but Amaziah's attitude reveals a deeper issue. The victory over Edom is recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/25-11.htm">2 Chronicles 25:11-12</a>, where Amaziah's forces killed ten thousand Edomites and captured another ten thousand. This success, however, led to pride rather than humility and gratitude towards God.<p><b>and your heart has become proud and boastful.</b><br>Pride is a recurring theme in the Bible, often leading to downfall. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that pride goes before destruction. Amaziah's pride is a spiritual issue, reflecting a heart that has turned away from reliance on God. This pride is reminiscent of other biblical figures who fell due to arrogance, such as King Saul and King Nebuchadnezzar. The Bible consistently teaches that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>Now stay at home.</b><br>This counsel is given by King Jehoash of Israel, warning Amaziah to refrain from further military ambitions. The phrase suggests a call to contentment and a warning against unnecessary conflict. Staying at home implies focusing on internal matters rather than seeking external conquests. This advice aligns with biblical principles of peace and wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a>, which advises stopping strife before it breaks out.<p><b>Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall&#8212;you and Judah with you?&#8221;</b><br>The warning highlights the potential consequences of Amaziah's prideful actions, not just for himself but for the entire nation of Judah. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders' actions can have widespread effects on their people. The fall of a leader often leads to national disaster, as seen in the history of Israel and Judah. The warning is prophetic, as Amaziah's refusal to heed it leads to his defeat and capture by Jehoash, as recorded later in <a href="/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21-24</a>. This serves as a reminder of the importance of humility and seeking God's guidance in leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>King of Judah who became proud after defeating Edom.

Yet every triumph Israel or Judah ever enjoyed was the Lord&#8217;s doing (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). Forgetting this turns celebration into self-exaltation (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>). God had already warned Amaziah that hiring Israelite mercenaries would fail because &#8220;God has power to help and to overthrow&#8221; (2 Chron 25:8). Ignoring that truth, he now speaks as though the outcome rested on his own strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and your heart has become proud and boastful.</b><p>Pride quietly moves from the lips to the heart. Scripture calls it the precursor to ruin (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; 2 Chron 26:16). When a leader&#8217;s heart swells, several symptoms surface:<p>&#8226; credit shifts from God to self (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>)<p>&#8226; counsel is despised (2 Chron 25:16)<p>&#8226; the welfare of others becomes secondary (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>)<p>God resists such arrogance but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). Amaziah stands on a slippery slope the moment he entertains boastful thoughts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now stay at home.</b><p>King Jehoash of Israel answers Amaziah&#8217;s challenge with fatherly realism. Staying home would spare both kingdoms needless bloodshed. Scripture often pairs prudence with peace (<a href="/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a>; <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). The warning shows God&#8217;s mercy: He offers off-ramps before judgment falls (<a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4-10</a>). Amaziah still has time to heed the call, humble himself, and regroup around the Lord&#8217;s purpose rather than personal glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall&#8212;you and Judah with you?</b><p>Pride never collapses in isolation; bystanders suffer too. David&#8217;s census cost Israel 70,000 lives (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>), and Amaziah&#8217;s stubbornness will soon bring defeat at Beth-shemesh and the breaching of Jerusalem&#8217;s wall (2 Chron 25:20-23). God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>), yet warns beforehand to avert disaster. The verse reminds every believer that unchecked pride endangers families, churches, and nations (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/25-19.htm">2 Chronicles 25:19</a> exposes the chain reaction from victory to vanity to vulnerability. Amaziah&#8217;s boast over Edom bred pride, blinding him to wise counsel and placing Judah in jeopardy. God, through Jehoash, graciously intervenes: recognize who truly grants success, reject self-exaltation, remain peaceable, and remember that pride&#8217;s fall affects more than just the proud heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Thou sayest.</span>--Slightly altered from <a href="/2_kings/14-10.htm" title="You have indeed smitten Edom, and your heart has lifted you up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why should you meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?">2Kings 14:10</a>.

He knows human nature well, and Amaziah's particular variety therein perfectly well. And many would have snapped at the opportunity of humbling such a man. But not so Joash; he enjoys, indeed, the opportunity of satisfying his own sarcasm and patronizingness, but would still spare Amaziah's people and save him from himself. This does not resemble, at any rote, the commonest, poorest, hungriest style of soul. <span class="cmt_word">To boast</span>.
