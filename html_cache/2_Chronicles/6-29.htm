In the context of Solomon's dedication of the temple, it underscores the temple as a central place for worship and intercession. Historically, the temple in Jerusalem was the focal point of Jewish religious life, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to hear and respond to the prayers of His people. The idea of prayer and plea is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/65-2.htm">Psalm 65:2</a>, which refers to God as the one who hears prayer.<p><b>each knowing his own afflictions</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the personal nature of prayer, where each individual is aware of their own struggles and needs. It suggests a deep self-awareness and honesty before God, recognizing one's own sins, weaknesses, and challenges. This personal introspection is a key aspect of genuine prayer, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>, where the psalmist asks God to search and know his heart. The concept of personal affliction also connects to the broader biblical theme of human suffering and the need for divine intervention and comfort.<p><b>and spreading out his hands toward this temple&#8212;</b><br>The act of spreading out hands is a gesture of supplication and surrender, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures as a physical expression of prayer. This gesture signifies openness and a plea for divine mercy and help. The direction toward the temple indicates the significance of the temple as the dwelling place of God's name, where His presence is most intimately encountered. This act of turning toward the temple is mirrored in <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, where Daniel prays facing Jerusalem, despite being in exile. The temple serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, as seen in <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>, where Jesus refers to His body as the temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple and is offering this prayer of dedication.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The house of God in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The covenant community of God, who are being addressed in Solomon's prayer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The recipient of the prayers and petitions, who dwells in the temple and hears the cries of His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/afflictions.htm">Afflictions</a></b><br>The personal struggles and challenges faced by individuals, which they bring before God in prayer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_personal_prayer.htm">The Importance of Personal Prayer</a></b><br>Each individual is encouraged to bring their personal struggles and petitions before God.
