In the ancient Near Eastern context, wisdom was highly valued, often associated with the ability to govern effectively and make just decisions. Solomon's request aligns with the biblical theme that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). This request also foreshadows the wisdom literature attributed to Solomon, such as Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon, which emphasize the importance of divine wisdom.<p><b>so that I may lead this people</b><br>Solomon's desire to lead the people highlights his recognition of the role of a king as a shepherd to his nation, a concept rooted in the Old Testament (<a href="/psalms/78-72.htm">Psalm 78:72</a>). The phrase "this people" refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, whom Solomon was appointed to rule. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the king serves as God's representative. Solomon's request underscores the biblical principle that leadership is a service to others, not a means of self-exaltation (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>).<p><b>For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?</b><br>Solomon acknowledges the greatness of the people, which can be understood in terms of their number, their history, and their special status as God's chosen nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). This rhetorical question emphasizes Solomon's humility and awareness of his limitations, recognizing that governing such a people requires divine assistance. The phrase "of Yours" signifies the theocratic nature of Israel, where God is the ultimate ruler. This echoes the biblical theme that all authority is established by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>) and points to the need for leaders to seek God's guidance in their governance. Solomon's request and subsequent divine grant of wisdom prefigure the perfect wisdom and leadership of Jesus Christ, who is described as the "wisdom of God" (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.

In using the words, "wisdom and knowledge," Solomon seems to have remembered well the prayer of his father (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-12.htm">1 Chronicles 22:12</a>). (For the pedigree of the simple and effective phrase, "know how to go out and come in," see <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13, 16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-25.htm">2 Samuel 3:25</a>). It is at the same time refreshing to revisit the times when the most exalted nominal ruler was also the real ruler, as being the leader, the judge, the teacher in the highest sense, and "the feeder" of his people. Nor is it less refreshing to notice how, in Israel at least, the fact was so well recognized and honoured, that <span class="accented">justice</span> and <span class="accented">to judge just judgment</span> lay at the deepest foundation of civil society. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ten-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
