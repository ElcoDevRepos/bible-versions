These elders were experienced advisors, having witnessed the prosperity and challenges of Solomon's reign. Their reply is rooted in wisdom gained from years of governance and understanding of the people's needs.<p><b>If you will be kind to these people</b><br>The call for kindness reflects a principle found throughout Scripture, where leaders are encouraged to show compassion and understanding. This echoes the biblical theme of servant leadership, as seen in Jesus' teachings (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>). Kindness in leadership is a recurring theme, emphasizing the importance of empathy and care for those under one's authority.<p><b>and please them by speaking kind words to them</b><br>The emphasis on kind words highlights the power of speech in leadership. <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> states, "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger." The elders advise Rehoboam to use his words to build rapport and trust with the people, recognizing the impact of communication in maintaining unity and loyalty.<p><b>they will be your servants forever</b><br>This promise of lasting loyalty is contingent upon the king's treatment of his subjects. The concept of servitude here is not one of oppression but of willing service, akin to the relationship between Christ and His followers (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>).

According to the modern phrase, he was just ripe to have known and bethought himself of this. But all rashly Rehoboam casts the die. The sound judgment, real knowledge, opportune and practical advice of the "old men," uttered evidently off so kind a tongue, should have been indeed now "as good as an inheritance; yea, better too" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>, margin). The reading of the parallel is well worthy to be noted (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>), with its manifestly pleasantly and skilfully worded antithesis, "If <span class="accented">thou this day</span> will be a servant to this people... then <span class="accented">they</span> will be thy servants <span class="accented">for ever."</span> Our words, however, have their own exquisite beauty about them, <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt be kind to this</span> <span class="cmt_word">people, and please them, and speak good words to them.</span> One might fancy that Saul, and David, and Solomon, and angels themselves bended over the scene, and looked and listened and longed for wisdom and love and right to prevail. <span class="cmt_word">The young men that had grown up with him</span>. While this expression throws light as above on that which speaks of Rehoboam's <span class="cmt_word">old men</span> counsellors, it wakens the question how men of forty-one years of age can be called "young," as Rehoboam was not living in patriarchal aged times. And the question is emphasized by the language applied to Rehoboam in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>, where he is described as "young and tenderhearted," and unable, for want of strength of character and of knowledge, to "withstand vain men" (as he surely shows too clearly now). It has been suggested ('Speaker's Commentary,' 2:562, Note C) that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span> (21) should be read for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;</span> (41) in the two passages quoted above (<a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>).
