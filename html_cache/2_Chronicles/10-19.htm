The division of the kingdom occurred around 930 BC, and the chronicler is writing from a post-exilic perspective, likely in the 5th century BC. This enduring division highlights the long-lasting consequences of the rebellion and the failure to reunite the tribes under a single monarchy.<p><b>Israel has been in rebellion</b><br>The term "rebellion" refers to the northern tribes' rejection of Rehoboam's rule, leading to the establishment of the separate kingdom of Israel under Jeroboam. This rebellion was not merely political but also spiritual, as it involved the rejection of the Davidic covenant, which promised a ruler from David's line. The rebellion is a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>), indicating divine judgment on Solomon's idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>against the house of David</b><br>The "house of David" refers to the dynastic line established by God through David, with promises of an everlasting kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The division of the kingdom represents a significant breach in the unity of the Israelite nation and a challenge to the Davidic covenant. This division foreshadows the eventual coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic promise, who would unite all believers under His eternal reign (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>). The rebellion against the house of David also serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's chosen leadership and covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Judah, whose harsh response to the Israelites led to the division of the kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who led the ten tribes in rebellion against Rehoboam.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the ten northern tribes that broke away from the united monarchy under Rehoboam's rule.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_david.htm">House of David</a></b><br>The royal lineage of David, which continued to rule over the southern kingdom of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The place where Rehoboam went to be crowned king and where the rebellion against him was solidified.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride_and_harsh_leadership.htm">The Consequences of Pride and Harsh Leadership</a></b><br>Rehoboam's pride and refusal to listen to wise counsel led to the division of the kingdom.

The phrase appears repeatedly (e.g., <a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-34.htm">2 Kings 17:34</a>) to underline lasting outcomes.<p>- It signals that the division was not a temporary spat but a standing condition God allowed as discipline (<a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israel</b><p>- Here &#8220;Israel&#8221; refers to the ten northern tribes who rejected Rehoboam&#8217;s rule (<a href="/2_chronicles/10-16.htm">2 Chronicles 10:16-17</a>).<p>- Though politically separated, they remained God&#8217;s covenant people; prophets such as Elijah and Hosea ministered there (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>).<p>- The Chronicler&#8217;s southern audience is reminded that their estranged brethren still bear the patriarch&#8217;s name (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has been</b><p>- A continuous verb points to an unbroken state since the schism. The northern kingdom never returned under a Davidic monarch before the exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6-23</a>).<p>- Generations passed, yet the breach endured&#8212;echoing the long-term patterns of blessing or judgment described in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in rebellion</b><p>- The rebellion was political&#8212;refusing David&#8217;s heir (<a href="/2_chronicles/10-19.htm">2 Chronicles 10:19</a> parallels <a href="/1_kings/12-19.htm">1 Kings 12:19</a>)&#8212;but it also carried spiritual undertones. Rejecting the throne God established (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>) meant resisting God&#8217;s chosen order.<p>- Jeroboam compounded the revolt by instituting calf worship at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>), drawing the people into idolatry that prophets condemned (<a href="/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against the house of David</b><p>- God had promised an everlasting dynasty to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3-4</a>). The northern tribes&#8217; stance placed them at odds with that divine covenant line.<p>- Even so, God preserved a lamp in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>). Rehoboam retained Judah and Benjamin, and faithful priests and Levites migrated south (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-17</a>), ensuring the Messianic promise stayed on course toward Christ (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/10-19.htm">2 Chronicles 10:19</a> captures the enduring fallout of one fateful choice: the ten tribes&#8217; break with David&#8217;s heir. That rupture, still present &#8220;to this day&#8221; for the Chronicler, illustrates how immediate decisions forge long-term realities. Politically, the kingdom divided; spiritually, many drifted from God&#8217;s covenant design. Yet the verse also quietly testifies to God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;He safeguarded the house of David so the promised Messiah would come, offering ultimate reconciliation for every rebel heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Unto this day</span>.--Neither the compiler of Kings nor the chronicler saw fit to alter a phrase which no longer applied to the political circumstances of their own day.
