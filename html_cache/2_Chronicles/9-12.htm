The queen of Sheba's visit is a testament to Solomon's fame and the widespread recognition of his wisdom and prosperity. Her desires likely included both material gifts and answers to her questions, showcasing Solomon's ability to satisfy both intellectual and material needs. This act of giving also demonstrates the diplomatic relationships and exchanges between nations during Solomon's reign.<p><b>whatever she asked&#8212;</b><br>The queen's requests may have included insights into Solomon's wisdom, as well as tangible gifts. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of exchanging gifts and knowledge among royalty. Solomon's willingness to fulfill her requests underscores his reputation for wisdom and generosity, as well as the political and economic stability of his kingdom. This interaction can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament, where Jesus states, "Ask, and it will be given to you" (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>), highlighting the theme of divine generosity.<p><b>far more than she had brought the king.</b><br>The queen of Sheba brought a significant amount of wealth to Solomon, including gold, spices, and precious stones (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-9.htm">2 Chronicles 9:9</a>). Solomon's response of giving her more than she brought emphasizes his immense wealth and the prosperity of his kingdom. This exchange illustrates the principle of abundant giving found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>, where it is said that giving will result in receiving more in return. It also reflects the idea that God's blessings often exceed human expectations.<p><b>Then she left and returned to her own country,</b><br>The queen's departure signifies the completion of her diplomatic mission and the successful exchange between her kingdom and Solomon's. Her return to her own country, likely the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia, suggests the far-reaching influence of Solomon's reign. This journey also highlights the extensive trade routes and cultural exchanges of the ancient world. The queen's visit and subsequent return can be seen as a type of the Gentiles coming to the light of Israel, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>.<p><b>along with her servants.</b><br>The mention of her servants indicates the queen's high status and the entourage that accompanied her, which was customary for royal visits. This detail underscores the importance of her visit and the respect she held for Solomon. The presence of her servants also suggests the logistical and diplomatic complexity of such a journey, reflecting the organized and hierarchical nature of ancient societies. This entourage can be seen as a parallel to the followers of Christ, who accompany Him and witness His wisdom and glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building the Temple in Jerusalem.

This mirrors the earlier scene where Solomon asked God for wisdom and received it (2 Chron 1:7-12).<p>- It anticipates Christ&#8217;s words, &#8220;Ask, and it will be given to you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>).<p>- The passage underscores that true wisdom does not fear hard questions (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>); Solomon&#8217;s answers satisfied her heart (2 Chron 9:1-5).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Far more than she had brought the king</b><p>- She arrived with &#8220;120 talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones&#8221; (2 Chron 9:9).

Their shared experience broadened the testimony of Solomon&#8217;s&#8212;and ultimately God&#8217;s&#8212;wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>).<p>- Communities, not just individuals, are meant to witness the Lord&#8217;s goodness (<a href="/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/9-12.htm">2 Chronicles 9:12</a> records literal events that showcase Solomon&#8217;s God-given wisdom and overflowing generosity. The queen of Sheba, having come with staggering wealth and hard questions, departs with greater riches and deeper understanding. The verse illustrates God&#8217;s pattern: He answers honest inquiry, rewards faith, and gives far beyond what He receives, inviting every generation to trust His lavish provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Beside that which she had brought unto the king.</span>--It can hardly be meant that Solomon returned her own presents. If the reading be sound, we may understand <span class= "ital">return presents, i.e.,</span> gifts equal in value to those which she had bestowed. Or better, we may regard the clause as a parenthetic note of the chronicler's, to the effect that the giving of presents was <span class= "ital">not all on one side.</span> Solomon showed himself as royally generous as his visitor. Putting the clause first would make this meaning clearer: "And quite apart from what she brought the king, Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire." Bertheau, however, proposes a slight change in the Hebrew text, so as to get the sense, "beside what the king had brought for her." <a href="/1_kings/10-13.htm" title="And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.">1Kings 10:13</a> is much clearer: "besides what he had given her, according to the hand of king Solomon." LXX. translates, "besides all that she brought to king Solomon;" the Vulg., "and far more than she had brought him," which <span class= "ital">may</span> be a trace of the original reading; the Syriac, "besides what he had given her." Syriac and Arabic add, "and he revealed to her all that was in her heart."<p><span class= "bld">She turned.</span>--<span class= "ital">H?phak,</span> for <span class= "ital">p?n?h</span> of Kings, which is more usual in this sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside that which she had brought unto the king</span>. The parallel has not this obscure clause, but has, "beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal Bounty." Professor Dr. Murphy explains our clause as purporting to say this: Solomon gave all the queen's desire in the way of bounty, "beside" all that belonged as an equivalent for "what she had brought." She got so much sheer gift, beside all that, according to the then Eastern custom, was her due. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/9-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1448;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
