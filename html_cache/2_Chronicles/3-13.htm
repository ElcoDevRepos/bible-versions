A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches, making the total wingspan about 30 feet. This grand scale emphasizes the majesty and holiness of the temple, reflecting the glory of God. Cherubim are often associated with the presence of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a>, where they serve as guardians of sacred spaces. The large wingspan signifies the protection and covering of God's presence over His people, similar to the imagery in <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>, where God covers His people with His wings.<p><b>They stood on their feet, facing the main room.</b><br>The positioning of the cherubim, standing on their feet, suggests readiness and vigilance, symbolizing the active presence of God. Their orientation towards the main room, or the Holy Place, indicates their role in overseeing the activities within the temple, ensuring that the worship and sacrifices are conducted in accordance with divine instructions. This setup mirrors the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant, which also faced each other and the mercy seat, as described in <a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>. The cherubim's stance and direction highlight the importance of reverence and proper worship in the presence of God, a theme echoed throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the Levitical laws.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings often associated with the presence and glory of God.
