The Valley of Ben-hinnom, located southwest of Jerusalem, became infamous for its association with pagan worship and child sacrifice. This valley later became synonymous with Gehenna, a term used in the New Testament to describe hell. The burning of incense was a common practice in idol worship, often intended to appease or invoke the favor of false gods.<p><b>and sacrificed his sons in the fire</b><br>This horrific act of child sacrifice was a practice associated with the worship of the Canaanite god Molech. Such practices were explicitly condemned in <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>. The sacrifice of children was seen as the ultimate abomination, demonstrating the depth of Ahaz's apostasy and the influence of surrounding pagan cultures on Israel. This act was a direct violation of God's commandments and a rejection of the sanctity of life.<p><b>according to the abominations of the nations</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to practices that are detestable and repugnant to God. The nations mentioned here are the Canaanite peoples whom God had driven out before the Israelites due to their wickedness. These abominations included idolatry, child sacrifice, and other morally corrupt practices. The Israelites were warned repeatedly not to adopt these customs (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>).<p><b>that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites</b><br>This phrase recalls the conquest of Canaan, where God commanded the Israelites to dispossess the land's inhabitants due to their sinful practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). The driving out of these nations was both a judgment on their sin and a means to protect Israel from their corrupting influence.

In Ahaz&#8217;s case, it was directed toward false gods (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The Valley of Ben-hinnom (later called Gehenna) had become a center of idolatrous rituals (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). By choosing this location, Ahaz openly rejected the ordained worship God had set in Jerusalem (2 Chron 6:6).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s behavior signaled more than personal rebellion; it led the nation astray (2 Chron 28:19), showing how leadership can influence a people either toward or away from God (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This setting foreshadows judgment imagery; Jesus later alludes to Gehenna when describing eternal punishment (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>), underscoring how detestable these practices were to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sacrificed his sons in the fire</b><p>&#8226; The phrase is literal: Ahaz burned his own children as offerings (<a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God had explicitly forbidden this horror:<p>&#8211; &#8220;You must not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;Do not imitate their detestable ways&#8230; even their sons and daughters they burn in the fire&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-30.htm">Deuteronomy 12:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Child sacrifice epitomized the depth of Judah&#8217;s apostasy. It inverted God&#8217;s design for family&#8212;parents should protect life, not destroy it (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; By violating the most basic moral law, Ahaz invited divine discipline. The chapter records immediate consequences: defeats by Aram and Israel (2 Chron 28:5-6) and later Assyrian domination (2 Chron 28:20).<p>&#8226; The New Testament reaffirms the sanctity of life and the seriousness of causing &#8220;little ones&#8221; to stumble (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>), highlighting the timelessness of God&#8217;s moral standards.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites</b><p>&#8226; God had expelled the Canaanite nations because of these very practices (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>). Ahaz repeated what had once brought judgment upon them, proving that privilege does not exempt anyone from accountability.<p>&#8226; The term &#8220;abominations&#8221; underscores actions utterly repugnant to God (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>). They defile both land and people (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; By copying pagan customs, Judah forfeited covenant blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). The pattern is clear:<p>&#8211; Imitation of the world leads to spiritual blindness (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-25</a>).<p>&#8211; Spiritual compromise invites divine discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s prior warning&#8212;&#8220;Do not follow their statutes&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/20-23.htm">Leviticus 20:23</a>)&#8212;shows His desire to protect His people from destructive sin. Ahaz&#8217;s choice displays the tragic outcome when leaders ignore that warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a> records King Ahaz&#8217;s open embrace of pagan worship: offering incense in a notoriously idolatrous valley and literally burning his sons alive. Each act violated God&#8217;s clear commands and mirrored the vile customs that had led to the Canaanites&#8217; expulsion. Ahaz&#8217;s behavior illustrates how quickly a nation can descend when it rejects God&#8217;s word, reminding us that idolatry, the devaluation of life, and conformity to a godless culture always invite God&#8217;s righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Moreover he.</span>--"And <span class= "ital">he</span> (emphatic) burnt incense" to Moloch, the god of Ammon, for whom Solomon had built a high place (<a href="/context/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.">1Kings 11:5-8</a>), which was still in existence.<p><span class= "bld">In the valley of the son of Hinnom.</span>--Also called simply the valley of Hinnom (<a href="/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>), on the west and south of Jerusalem (<a href="/joshua/18-16.htm" title="And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,">Joshua 18:16</a>), the scene of the cruel rites in honour of<p>"Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood."<p>MILTON.<p>(<a href="/context/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31-32</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/19-2.htm" title="And go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you,">Jeremiah 19:2-6</a>, where "the Baal" is named as the object of this worship, Moloch being a Baal.)
