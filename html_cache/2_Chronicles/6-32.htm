In the ancient Near Eastern context, deities were often seen as national gods, but here, Solomon's prayer recognizes the universal reach of the God of Israel. This anticipates the New Testament theme of the inclusion of Gentiles, as seen in passages like <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, where Peter realizes that God shows no favoritism.<p><b>but has come from a distant land</b><br>The mention of a "distant land" highlights the far-reaching reputation of Israel's God. This reflects the historical reality of Israel's strategic location, which was a crossroads of ancient civilizations. The fame of Solomon's wisdom and the prosperity of his kingdom would have attracted visitors from afar, as seen in the account of the Queen of Sheba in <a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10</a>.<p><b>because of Your great name and Your mighty hand and outstretched arm&#8212;</b><br>The "great name" of God refers to His reputation and character, which were known among the nations. The "mighty hand and outstretched arm" are expressions often used in the Old Testament to describe God's power and deliverance, particularly in the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and His acts of salvation, which are a testimony to all peoples.<p><b>when he comes and prays toward this temple,</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence. Praying toward the temple signifies recognition of God's presence and authority. This practice is seen in <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, where Daniel prays toward Jerusalem. The temple serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).
