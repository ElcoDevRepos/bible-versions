Jerusalem, the capital city, held significant religious and political importance as the location of the Temple, which Solomon had built. This city was the center of worship for the Israelites and symbolized God's presence among His people. Rehoboam's residence in Jerusalem underscores the continuity of Davidic rule and the centrality of the city in Judah's identity. The choice of Jerusalem as his dwelling place also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his descendants would continue to rule from this city (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>and he built up cities for defense in Judah</b><br>Following the division of the kingdom, Rehoboam focused on strengthening his territory against potential threats, particularly from the northern kingdom of Israel and other neighboring nations. The construction of fortified cities was a strategic move to protect Judah's borders and maintain control over the region. These cities served as military outposts and refuges in times of conflict. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of fortified cities during this period, highlighting the historical accuracy of the biblical account. This action reflects a common practice in the ancient Near East, where kings fortified cities to secure their reign and protect their people. The emphasis on defense also points to the turbulent political climate of the time, as Rehoboam sought to consolidate his power and ensure the survival of his kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the grandson of David, Rehoboam was the first king of the southern kingdom of Judah after the united monarchy of Israel split.
