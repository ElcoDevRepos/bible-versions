The people, led by Jeroboam, requested that Rehoboam lighten the heavy burdens imposed by Solomon. Rehoboam's refusal to heed their plea led to the division of the kingdom. This moment highlights the importance of wise counsel and the consequences of ignoring the needs of the people. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan, as Rehoboam's decision was influenced by divine will rather than mere human error.<p><b>and indeed this turn of events was from God</b><br>This indicates that the division of the kingdom was not merely a political or social occurrence but was orchestrated by God. It underscores the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over human affairs. This divine intervention was a response to Solomon's idolatry and disobedience, as God had previously warned that the kingdom would be torn from his lineage. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>in order that the LORD might fulfill the word that He had spoken</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the reliability and certainty of God's word. The events were a direct fulfillment of a prophecy, demonstrating that God's promises and warnings are always accomplished. It reassures believers of the trustworthiness of God's word and His control over history.<p><b>through Ahijah the Shilonite</b><br>Ahijah was a prophet from Shiloh, a significant religious center in Israel before the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital. His prophecy to Jeroboam, recorded in <a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>, foretold the division of the kingdom and Jeroboam's rise to power.

His rise to power was part of God's plan to discipline the house of David for Solomon's sins.

Rehoboam&#8217;s refusal to listen sprang from his own pride, yet God superintended the decision to accomplish His previously declared word through Ahijah. The verse assures us that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promises are certain.<p>&#8226; Human choices remain meaningful.<p>&#8226; Even in divisive moments, the Lord is guiding history toward His redemptive ends.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The cause was of God.</span>--<span class= "ital">It was brought about by God.</span> Literally, <span class= "ital">it was a turn</span> or <span class= "ital">turning-point</span> (<span class= "ital">of events</span>)<span class= "ital"> from with God.</span> The word <span class= "ital">n'sibbah</span> is equivalent to <span class= "ital">sibbah</span> of Kings.

Ahijah</span> (see, as before, <a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>, also 9-39). Rehoboam hearkened not, as Pharaoh hearkened not, but hardened his heart. The Divine word foretold, as the Divine mind foreknew, the inevitable course of the stream, that took its source in and from Solomon's faithless heart and life. Solomon "being dead yet" bears his full share of the responsibility of what Rehoboam was, and shortly came to <span class="accented">show</span> he was. Everything must fall out as God foretells it shall fall out, not because "the cause is from him" in <span class="accented">this</span> sense that he has made it, but in the sense that he has pronounced it, through knowing it with an absolute knowledge. It were but a thing to be expected also, that just in the measure that the Bible is the Word of God, it shall exhibit and pronounce plainly the phenomena of his own ultimate fiats, rather than linger to track or describe the uncertainties of human morality or conduct. Let but that <span class="accented">result</span> appear, which God has with his sure and abiding Word declared, and the practical attitude and language of Scripture are that it is vain to fight against it; for the thing is of God. It was known of him and said of him. And it carries its punishment or its recompense in it, as of him. It will be noticed, again, how our compiler refers to the incident of Ahijah, as though he had recorded it, which he had not done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/10-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
