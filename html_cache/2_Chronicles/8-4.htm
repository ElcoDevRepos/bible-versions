Its strategic location made it a vital trade center connecting the East and West. Solomon's construction of Tadmor highlights his wisdom in establishing trade routes and fortifying his kingdom's economic strength. The wilderness setting emphasizes the challenges of building in remote areas, showcasing Solomon's resourcefulness and the prosperity of his reign. This construction effort reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Solomon for wisdom and wealth (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12-13</a>).<p><b>in addition to all the store cities</b><br>Store cities were essential for the storage of goods, grain, and supplies, ensuring the kingdom's stability and preparedness for times of scarcity or conflict. These cities demonstrate Solomon's administrative acumen and foresight in managing resources. The concept of store cities is reminiscent of Joseph's strategy in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48-49</a>), where he stored grain during years of plenty to prepare for famine. This parallel underscores the importance of wise stewardship and planning.<p><b>that he had built in Hamath</b><br>Hamath was a significant city-state located in modern-day Syria, north of Israel. It was an important center during Solomon's reign, and its inclusion in his building projects indicates the extent of his influence and control. The mention of Hamath connects to the broader narrative of Israel's territorial expansion under Solomon, fulfilling the promises made to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). This expansion also prefigures the ultimate reign of Christ, who will establish His kingdom over all the earth (<a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>). Solomon's efforts in Hamath reflect the peace and prosperity that characterized his reign, serving as a type of the future Messianic kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tadmor.htm">Tadmor</a></b><br>A city built by Solomon in the wilderness, which later became known as Palmyra, a significant trade center.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The region where Tadmor was built, indicating a strategic location for trade and defense.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/store_cities.htm">Store Cities</a></b><br>Cities built by Solomon to store supplies, likely for military and trade purposes, enhancing the kingdom's infrastructure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamath.htm">Hamath</a></b><br>A region in northern Israel, indicating the extent of Solomon's building projects and influence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_planning_and_wisdom.htm">Strategic Planning and Wisdom</a></b><br>Solomon's building of Tadmor and store cities reflects the importance of strategic planning and foresight.

They were no doubt "places of arms," and served as outposts against the hostile neighbouring kingdom of Zobah-Damascus. (See <a href="/context/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1Kings 11:23-25</a>.) So far as they lay on the caravan route, they would serve also as victualling stations. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-28.htm" title="Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.">2Chronicles 32:28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tadmor in the wilderness</span>. Tadmor, one with the classical Palmyra, lay in the desert of Syria, about half-way between the rivers Orontes and Euphrates, and distant from Damascus about a hundred and <span class="accented">forty</span> miles to its east-north-east. Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 8, note 1) says, "Is it quite certain that 'Tadmor' and 'Palmyra' are words derived from the (palms)? A palm is in Hebrew <span class="accented">tamar</span>... and in Greek... <span class="accented">phoenix."</span> Solomon was probably not the originator, but rather re-builder, of the place. Its fame was great under Zenobia, the Queen of Odenathus; she was taken captive by the Emperor Aurelian, A.D. 273, when the city was subdued. It is now little better than the haunt of a few Arabs Splendid ruins remain, specially of the great temple of the sun. The Hebrew text of <a href="/1_kings/9-18.htm">1 Kings 9:18</a> has apparently <span class="accented">Tamer</span>, or <span class="accented">Tamar</span>, and it has been suggested by Movers on that passage that possibly a Tamar in the south, and that is found in the neighbourhood of some of the other places, such as Baalath, Beth-heron, and Gezer, all in the south (<a href="/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a>; ch. 20:2), is intended. Our text, however, in the present place offers no choice, while that in Kings (compare Chethiv and Keri) is doubtful. And finally, our writer is <span class="accented">here</span> evidently in the neighbourhood of Hamath, which of course best suits Tadmor. Although there is an apparent disjointedness between this and the parallel, closer notice may rather bring confirmation of substantial agreement between them. For instance, the <span class="cmt_word">store cities</span> here spoken of as belonging to Hamath (but not individually named here and not corresponding with those that <span class="accented">are</span> named in Kings) are accounted for by the words, "and in Lebanon," in <a href="/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He built</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7687;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
