The temple, as the dwelling place of God, was to be approached with reverence and only by those who were consecrated for service. The priests and Levites were set apart for this purpose, highlighting the importance of holiness and order in worship. This restriction underscores the separation between the holy and the common, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. The Levites were descendants of Levi, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, specifically chosen for temple duties (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-10</a>). This separation also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers as a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), where access to God is granted through Christ, the ultimate High Priest.<p><b>they may enter because they are consecrated,</b><br>Consecration involved rituals and sacrifices that symbolized purification and dedication to God&#8217;s service (<a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29:1-9</a>). This process set the priests and Levites apart, making them holy and fit to serve in the temple. The idea of consecration is central to understanding the relationship between God and His people, as it signifies being set apart for divine purposes. In the New Testament, believers are called to be consecrated through the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>), reflecting a life dedicated to God.<p><b>but all the people are to obey the requirement of the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, a recurring theme in the Bible. The requirement of the LORD refers to the laws and statutes given to Israel, which were to be followed diligently. Obedience is portrayed as a sign of faithfulness and devotion to God. In the broader biblical narrative, disobedience often leads to judgment, while obedience brings blessing. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of obeying God's commandments as an expression of love for Him (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>A key figure in the restoration of the Davidic line, Jehoiada orchestrated the overthrow of Queen Athaliah and the crowning of Joash as king.

The last clause of this verse may cover the contents of ver. 7 in the parallel.
