This indicates divine intervention and guidance. Prophets played a crucial role in advising kings and leaders, often delivering messages that were counter to political or military strategies. This phrase highlights the importance of seeking and heeding divine counsel over human wisdom.<p><b>O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you</b><br>At this time, the kingdom of Israel was divided into two: the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). King Amaziah of Judah was considering hiring mercenaries from Israel. The warning against this alliance underscores the spiritual and political tensions between the two kingdoms. It reflects the biblical principle of not forming alliances with those who are not aligned with God's purposes, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>.<p><b>for the LORD is not with Israel</b><br>This statement reflects the spiritual state of the northern kingdom, which had turned away from God under the leadership of various kings who promoted idolatry and false worship. The absence of God's presence signifies judgment and a lack of divine favor, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature. It serves as a warning to Judah to remain faithful to God.<p><b>not with any of the Ephraimites</b><br>Ephraim was one of the tribes of Israel and often used to represent the northern kingdom as a whole. The specific mention of Ephraimites emphasizes the broader spiritual decline of the northern tribes. Historically, Ephraim was a leading tribe in Israel, but its association with idolatry and rebellion against God is noted in passages like <a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>.
