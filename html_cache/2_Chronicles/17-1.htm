Jehoshaphat's reign marks a continuation of his father's policies, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a covenant relationship with God. The transition of power from Asa to Jehoshaphat signifies a period of stability and continuity in the southern kingdom of Judah. This phrase highlights the dynastic succession, which was crucial for maintaining the Davidic line, a key element in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Jehoshaphat's reign is noted for its emphasis on faithfulness to God, contrasting with the often idolatrous practices of the northern kingdom of Israel.<p><b>and he strengthened himself against Israel</b><br>This phrase indicates Jehoshaphat's strategic and military initiatives to fortify Judah against potential threats from the northern kingdom of Israel. The division between Israel and Judah followed the reign of Solomon, leading to two separate kingdoms often at odds with each other. Jehoshaphat's actions reflect a period of tension and conflict between the two kingdoms. His efforts to strengthen Judah included fortifying cities and building up the military, as detailed in the subsequent verses (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a>). This preparation was not only for defense but also to assert Judah's independence and stability. Theologically, this can be seen as an effort to protect the worship of Yahweh in Jerusalem, the spiritual center of Judah, from the influences of Israel's idolatry. Jehoshaphat's reign is characterized by a commitment to seeking God's guidance, as seen in his later reforms and alliances (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The son of Asa, Jehoshaphat became the king of Judah.
