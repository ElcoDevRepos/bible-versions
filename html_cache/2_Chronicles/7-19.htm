The concept of turning away is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with apostasy or rebellion against God. In the context of 2 Chronicles, it serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brings blessings and disobedience leads to consequences. This idea is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's faithfulness.<p><b>and forsake the statutes and commandments I have set before you</b><br>The statutes and commandments refer to the laws given by God to Israel, primarily through Moses. These laws were meant to guide the Israelites in their daily lives and maintain their covenant relationship with God. Forsaking these laws implies a deliberate rejection of God's authority and guidance. Historically, Israel's failure to adhere to these commandments often led to periods of judgment and exile, as seen in the Babylonian captivity. This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's revealed will.<p><b>and if you go off to serve and worship other gods</b><br>Serving and worshiping other gods was a direct violation of the first commandment, which prohibits idolatry. In the ancient Near Eastern context, polytheism was prevalent, and Israel was constantly tempted to adopt the religious practices of surrounding nations. This phrase highlights the danger of syncretism, where the worship of Yahweh could be compromised by the inclusion of other deities. The prophets frequently warned against this, as seen in the ministries of Elijah and Jeremiah. Theologically, this serves as a type of spiritual adultery, where Israel's unfaithfulness to God is likened to an unfaithful spouse.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem.

Love and obedience walk together; rejection of one is rejection of the other.<p>Forsaking God&#8217;s Word severs the lifeline of blessing and leads inevitably to discipline (<a href="/psalms/119-155.htm">Psalm 119:155</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if you go off to serve and worship other gods,</b><p>Here is the end of the downward spiral: idolatry.
