This phrase indicates his initial act of leadership, addressing the entire nation. Solomon's reign marks a period of peace and prosperity, fulfilling God's promise to David. Speaking to "all Israel" signifies his role as a unifying figure, emphasizing the importance of national unity under his rule. This act echoes the leadership style of Moses and Joshua, who also addressed the entire assembly of Israel, reinforcing Solomon's position as a divinely appointed leader.<p><b>to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds</b><br>The mention of military commanders highlights the organized structure of Israel's army. Commanders of thousands and hundreds were responsible for leading troops in battle, reflecting a well-established military hierarchy. This structure is reminiscent of the organization established by Moses in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, where leaders were appointed over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. Solomon's address to these commanders underscores the importance of military strength and readiness, even during times of peace.<p><b>to the judges</b><br>Judges in Israel were responsible for maintaining justice and order, a role that was crucial for the stability of the nation. By addressing the judges, Solomon emphasizes the importance of justice and righteousness, foundational principles of his reign. This focus on justice aligns with the wisdom for which Solomon is renowned, as seen in his request for wisdom to govern the people in <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>. The judges' role is also a reminder of the period of the Judges, when leaders were raised to deliver Israel and maintain covenant faithfulness.<p><b>and to every leader in all Israel&#8212;the heads of the families</b><br>The heads of families, or tribal leaders, played a significant role in the social and political structure of Israel. They were responsible for representing their clans and ensuring the welfare of their members. By addressing these leaders, Solomon acknowledges the decentralized nature of Israelite society, where family and tribal affiliations were paramount. This gathering of leaders reflects the covenantal structure of Israel, where each tribe and family had a role in the nation's spiritual and communal life. Solomon's engagement with these leaders demonstrates his commitment to inclusive governance and the importance of maintaining the covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.

And the allusions to the judge and his office thenceforward sustain our impression of the honour in which they were held, arising, no doubt, largely from the deep-felt necessity for them, the more society crystallized (<a href="/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-2.htm">Deuteronomy 21:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8-10</a>). In <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a> we are told how David set apart "six thousand Levites" to be "officers and judges." <span class="cmt_word">Every governor</span>. The word employed here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) is rendered by five different words in our Authorized Version: "prince" (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>), "ruler" (<a href="/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>), "captain" (<a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>), "chief" Numbers 3:24, <span class="accented">passim</span>), and "governor" in the present passage only. It is evidently a term of generic signification, used of a king (<a href="/1_kings/11-34.htm">1 Kings 11:34</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-10.htm">Ezekiel 12:10</a>); of leaders of the Ishmaelites (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>); of the captains of the tribes of Israel (<a href="/numbers/7-11.htm">Numbers 7:11</a>); of the chiefs of families (<a href="/numbers/3-24.htm">Numbers 3:24</a>); while the use of it (<a href="/genesis/23-6.htm">Genesis 23:6</a>) to set forth the position of Abraham as one raised to eminence so high and undisputed that it might be clearly said to be God's doing, is sufficient to determine its <span class="accented">central</span> signification<span class="cmt_word">. The chief of the fathers</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the heads of the fathers. The first occurrence of the expression, "the heads of their fathers' houses" (<a href="/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>), and of "the heads <span class="accented">of the fathers</span> of the Levites according to their families" (<a href="/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>), sufficiently explains the original and perfectly natural meaning of the phrase. The great importance and significance of the position of the heads "of families" and "of houses" and" of fathers" in early patriarchal times must necessarily have declined by the time of Solomon, when the nation had received so much more of civil form and system. But the name remained, and the family and social position did not fail to make themselves felt, and finally the <span class="accented">official</span> recognition of them in David's time is evidenced by <a href="/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1</a>, and in Solomon's time both by the present passage and <a href="/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2</a> with its parallel <a href="/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>. Our present use of the expression ought probably to show it, in close apposition with the foregoing words, "to all Israel" (wrongly translated "in all Israel" in the Authorized Version), and which itself is a repetition of the "to all Israel" in the beginning of the verse. Although the existing Hebrew pointing of the verse does not favour the supposition, it may be that the writer means to emphasize Solomon's summons as made both to the kingdom as such, and to the people also as a united people. We are not, indeed, told here, in so many words, what it was that Solomon said "to all Israel." But there can be no doubt as to his object, as betrayed in the first clause of the following verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Solomon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8010.htm">Strong's 8010: </a> </span><span class="str2">Solomon -- David's son and successor to his throne</span><br /><br /><span class="word">spoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
