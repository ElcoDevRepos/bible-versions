His command reflects his authority and commitment to reestablishing the temple practices that had been neglected. This action is part of a broader reform movement that Hezekiah initiated, which included the cleansing of the temple and the reestablishment of the Passover (2 Chronicles 29-30). His leadership is often compared to that of David, as he sought to bring the nation back to the covenantal faithfulness.<p><b>to prepare storerooms</b><br>Storerooms in the temple were necessary for storing the tithes, offerings, and other contributions brought by the people. These storerooms were essential for the support of the priests and Levites, who were responsible for the temple services. The preparation of these storerooms indicates a revival of the Levitical system and the proper management of temple resources. This act of preparation can be seen as a practical step in ensuring the sustainability of the religious reforms Hezekiah was implementing.<p><b>in the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. The temple was not only a religious center but also a symbol of God's presence among His people. By focusing on the temple, Hezekiah was emphasizing the importance of centralized worship and the need to honor God according to the prescriptions given in the Law of Moses. This focus on the temple also highlights the continuity of worship practices from the time of Solomon, despite the intervening periods of idolatry and neglect.<p><b>and they did so</b><br>The obedience of the people to Hezekiah's command demonstrates their willingness to follow his leadership and participate in the religious renewal. This compliance is significant, as it shows a collective return to faithfulness and a desire to support the temple's function. The phrase also underscores the effectiveness of Hezekiah's reforms, as the people responded positively to his initiatives. This obedience can be seen as a fulfillment of the covenantal promise that God would bless His people if they returned to Him with all their heart (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-2.htm">Deuteronomy 30:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship of Yahweh.
