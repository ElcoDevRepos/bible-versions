His command reflects his commitment to restoring the temple, which had fallen into disrepair. Joash's leadership in this initiative is significant, as it demonstrates the role of a godly leader in guiding the people back to proper worship. This mirrors the biblical principle of leaders being shepherds to their people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd.<p><b>a chest was made</b><br>The chest was a practical solution for collecting funds for the temple's restoration. This act of creating a chest for offerings is reminiscent of the collection boxes used in the New Testament, such as the treasury in the temple where Jesus observed the widow's offering (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>). The chest symbolizes the importance of communal responsibility and generosity in supporting God's work.<p><b>and placed outside</b><br>Placing the chest outside ensured accessibility for all the people of Judah, encouraging widespread participation in the temple's restoration. This public placement signifies transparency and accountability in the collection of funds. It also reflects the openness of God's house to all who wish to contribute, paralleling the New Testament teaching of the church as a body where every member has a role (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>at the gate of the house of the LORD</b><br>The gate of the house of the LORD refers to the entrance of the temple, a central place of worship and sacrifice in Jerusalem. This location is significant as it was a place where people regularly gathered, ensuring that the call to contribute was visible to all. The temple gate is often a place of important events in Scripture, such as in <a href="/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a>, where Peter and John heal a lame man at the temple gate called Beautiful. The temple itself is a type of Christ, as it represents God's presence among His people, fulfilled in Jesus, who is Immanuel, "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_joash.htm">King Joash</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the repair of the temple.
