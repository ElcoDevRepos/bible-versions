Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Empire, conquered Babylon in 539 BC. His first year as king of Persia over Babylon is traditionally dated to 538 BC. This period is crucial as it marks the end of the Babylonian captivity for the Israelites. Cyrus's rise to power was prophesied by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28, 45</a>:1), highlighting God's sovereignty over nations and rulers.<p><b>to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah</b><br>Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonian exile would last seventy years (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12, 29</a>:10). The return of the exiles under Cyrus's decree fulfills this prophecy, demonstrating God's faithfulness to His word. This fulfillment underscores the reliability of prophetic scripture and God's control over history.<p><b>the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia</b><br>The phrase indicates divine intervention in the affairs of a pagan king, showing that God can use anyone to accomplish His purposes. This stirring of Cyrus's spirit is a testament to God's influence over the hearts of rulers (<a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). It also prefigures the way God would later use Gentile leaders to further His plans, as seen in the New Testament with figures like the Roman centurion Cornelius (Acts 10).<p><b>to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom</b><br>Cyrus's decree was a formal announcement, likely disseminated through written edicts and heralds. This proclamation allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple, a pivotal moment in Jewish history. The widespread nature of the proclamation reflects the vastness of the Persian Empire, which stretched from the Indus Valley to the Aegean Sea.<p><b>and to put it in writing as follows:</b><br>The written nature of the decree ensured its permanence and authority. This act of documentation is significant, as it provided a legal basis for the Jews' return and the rebuilding efforts. The emphasis on writing also highlights the importance of recorded scripture and decrees in preserving God's promises and actions for future generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyrus_king_of_persia.htm">Cyrus King of Persia</a></b><br>The ruler of the Persian Empire who played a pivotal role in the return of the Jewish exiles to Jerusalem.

539 BC marks the opening year of Cyrus&#8217;s reign over Babylon, signaling a brand-new season for God&#8217;s exiled people (cf. <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records this specific date to anchor the reader in verifiable history, reminding us that the Lord&#8217;s redemptive acts unfold in real time, not myth (cf. <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The fall of Babylon to Persia (<a href="/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30-31</a>) demonstrates God&#8217;s sovereign hand over empires, preparing the stage for Israel&#8217;s restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah had foretold seventy years of captivity, after which God would bring His people back (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>; 29:10).<p>&#8226; Daniel, reading Jeremiah, understood the timetable and prayed accordingly (<a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The precise fulfillment reveals God&#8217;s faithfulness: every promise He utters is certain (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; It also underscores that history&#8217;s ultimate script is Scripture itself; God&#8217;s Word drives events, not the other way around.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He will&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Cyrus was a pagan ruler, God moved him inwardly, demonstrating that even unbelieving authorities are instruments in His plan (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;stirred&#8221; shows divine initiative; revival and release begin with the Lord, not human lobbying (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom</b><p>&#8226;

Public, official communication confirms that the return was legal and irreversible, shielding the remnant from later opposition (<a href="/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The gospel parallel is striking: God&#8217;s good news is meant for &#8220;all the world&#8221;

God often secures His covenants in written form&#8212;think of the tablets at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>) or the book of the new covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The recorded proclamation becomes a permanent testimony of God&#8217;s faithfulness, encouraging future generations (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a> shows the Lord orchestrating international politics to keep His word exactly as spoken through Jeremiah. By pinpointing Cyrus&#8217;s first regnal year, the verse grounds redemption in history. God Himself moves the king&#8217;s heart, turns prophecy into policy, broadcasts freedom across an empire, and commits the decree to unchangeable writing. The passage proves that Scripture is both accurate and active; what God promises, He performs&#8212;down to the year, the ruler, and the written document that sets His people free.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the first year of Cyrus King of Persia</span>. A period of half a century has elapsed between the latest date of the foregoing verses (circ. <span class="date">B.C. 586</span>) and the date signalized here (circ. <span class="date">B.C. 5</span>.38-6). With the proclamation of <span class="accented">Cyrus</span> begins in fact the manhood, with all its mystic, its wonderful, and its still non-progressing struggles, of the Jew. His simple childhood, wilful youth, am indeed for ever gone. But he and his nation are with unspeakably painful travail born. No life of nation that is or ever has been merits the devout observation and study that this unchal-lengeably does. Our present verse and the one succeeding it are, sentence for sentence, the same with the opening verses of the Book of Ezra, which may possibly once have joined on to Chronicles, as one work, though we think this exceedingly unlikely. Cyrus (the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> of the Hebrew text) was the son of a royal Persian, Cambysses; his mother was Mandane, daughter of Astyages, last King of Media. The name appears on the monuments, written <span class="accented">Kurus.</span> Cyrus defeated his grandfather Astyages, <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>; ending thereby the Median royal line; and he defeated Croesus, <span class="date">B.C. 546</span>, possessing himself thereby of the kingdom of Lydia; he took Babylon, as above, <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. He himself died in battle, <span class="date">B.C. 529</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That the word of the Lord by... Jeremiah might be accomplished</span> (see <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-9.htm">Jeremiah 29:9-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus</span>. The fact is told us, and this, no doubt, as on a thousand other unsuspected occasions of far more intrinsic and vital interest in the Bible, is sufficient. It would have been interesting to know, however, even here, the mode in which Cyrus was appealed to; as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, it has been plausibly suggested that Daniel may have been in part instrumental in the work, and that, again, in part perhaps by directing the attention of Cyrus to <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>;
