This highlights the importance of heeding prophetic messages, which were often used by God to guide and correct His people. Prophets like Azariah played a crucial role in maintaining the spiritual health of Israel and Judah. The mention of Azariah as the son of Oded provides a specific historical context, grounding the narrative in a real lineage and emphasizing the continuity of prophetic ministry.<p><b>he took courage</b><br>Asa's response to the prophecy was one of courage, indicating a willingness to act upon divine instruction despite potential opposition. This courage is a recurring theme in the Bible, where leaders are often called to be strong and courageous in the face of challenges (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). Asa's courage is a model for believers to act decisively in obedience to God's word.<p><b>and removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue in Israel and Judah, often leading the people away from worshiping the one true God. Asa's removal of idols signifies a return to monotheistic worship and a rejection of the syncretism that plagued the nation. This act of purging idols is reminiscent of other reformative actions by kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who also sought to restore true worship (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-14</a>).<p><b>and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim</b><br>The hill country of Ephraim, part of the Northern Kingdom, had been captured by Asa, indicating his military success and influence beyond Judah and Benjamin. This geographical reference underscores the extent of Asa's reforms, reaching even into territories that were not originally part of his kingdom. It also reflects the historical tensions and interactions between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms.<p><b>He then restored the altar of the LORD that was in front of the portico of the LORD&#8217;s temple</b><br>Restoring the altar signifies a renewal of proper worship practices and a return to the covenantal relationship with God. The altar, located in front of the temple's portico, was central to the sacrificial system and the spiritual life of the nation. This restoration is symbolic of spiritual renewal and aligns with other biblical instances where altars are repaired or rebuilt as a sign of recommitment to God (<a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>, <a href="/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>).

This is not very likely; still, the conjunction "and" would thereby better account for itself. Nevertheless, it would still remain that the word "prophecy" is not in <span class="accented">construct</span> but absolute state, and we cannot count the difficulty removed, comparatively unimportant as it may be<span class="cmt_word">. He took courage, and put away</span>, etc. These words may express either Asa's accomplishing of the reforms spoken of in the former chapter (vers. 3-5), or quite as probably his perseverance and renewed diligence and vigour in the same; the language, "he took courage," favours this latter view. <span class="cmt_word">The cities which he had taken from</span>, etc. Some say that the reference here and in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a> also must be understood to be to <span class="accented">Abijah's</span> victory and spoils (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>), and that these two places must accordingly be in slight error. If this passage had stood alone, this view might have been more easy to accept, but the words in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a> explicitly state that Asa had taken such cities, and the mere fact that the history does not record <span class="accented">when</span>, nor even show any very convenient gap into which Asa's taking of such cities after conflict with Israel might well fit in, can scarcely be allowed to override the direct assertion of <a href="/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a> (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/16-11.htm">2 Chronicles 16:11</a>). At the same time, the work that would devolve on Asa in <span class="accented">holding</span> the cities his father Abijah had first taken, may easily account for all, and have been accounted Asa's taking, in the sense of <span class="accented">taking</span> to them, or retaking them. <span class="cmt_word">Renewed the altar</span>. The altar, the place of which was <span class="cmt_word">before the porch</span>, was the altar of burnt offering. The Hebrew for "renewed" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The Vulgate translates insufficiently <span class="accented">dedicavit.</span> Bertheau thinks the renewal designs simply the purification of it from idolatrous defilements, although he admits that this is to assume that it had been defiled by idolatrous priests. Keil says the altar might well need genuine repair after the lapse of sixty years from the building of the temple. Of the nine occurrences of the word. five are metaphorical(as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>), but of the remaining four distinctly literal uses, including the present, three must mean just strictly "repair" (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4, 12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>), and the probability may therefore be that such is the meaning now. Many, however, prefer the other view. The work of Ass, as described in <a href="/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3-5</a>, was one of taking away, breaking down, and cutting down; but this item shows it now, in his fifteenth year, become also one of renewing. and repairing.
