Jerusalem, the city chosen by God for His temple, was under threat from the Assyrian army. The Assyrians, known for their military prowess and conquests, underestimated the God of Israel, equating Him with the powerless idols of other nations. This reflects a common ancient Near Eastern belief that gods were territorial and limited in power. The God of Jerusalem, however, is the Creator of heaven and earth, transcending geographical boundaries. This blasphemy is a direct challenge to God's sovereignty and a test of faith for the people of Judah.<p><b>as they had spoken against the gods of the peoples of the earth</b><br>The Assyrians had a history of conquering nations and their gods, which they viewed as mere idols. This phrase highlights their arrogance and ignorance in equating the God of Israel with these false gods. Historically, the Assyrians would often mock the deities of the nations they defeated, believing their own gods superior. This reflects a broader cultural context where military success was seen as a sign of divine favor. However, the God of Israel is unique, not made by human hands, and not subject to human manipulation or defeat.<p><b>the work of human hands</b><br>This phrase underscores the biblical theme of idolatry, where gods are crafted by human hands and thus powerless. In contrast, the God of Israel is the living God, not created by human hands, and sovereign over all creation. This distinction is crucial in the biblical narrative, emphasizing the futility of idol worship. The prophets often ridiculed idols as lifeless and impotent (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). The phrase also serves as a reminder of the first and second commandments, which prohibit the making and worshiping of idols. This sets the stage for God's deliverance of Jerusalem, demonstrating His power and faithfulness in contrast to the impotence of idols.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The Assyrian king who invaded Judah and besieged Jerusalem.

The enemy of our souls still works this way (<a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>), whispering doubts to shake our confidence in God&#8217;s promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Against the God of Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; The target of their ridicule was &#8220;the God of Jerusalem.&#8221; He is not a regional deity but the covenant-keeping LORD who chose Zion for His name (2 Chron 6:6; <a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; By singling out Jerusalem&#8217;s God, the envoys attacked the heart of Judah&#8217;s identity and hope: &#8220;Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, &#8216;The LORD will deliver us&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/18-30.htm">2 Kings 18:30</a>).<p>&#8226; This hostility echoes Goliath&#8217;s earlier defiance (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).

By refusing to acknowledge the unique, sovereign LORD, they invited the very judgment that soon fell&#8212;&#8220;the LORD sent an angel, who annihilated every mighty warrior&#8221; (2 Chron 32:21).
