It was the place where the presence of God was believed to dwell, and only the high priest could enter, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-34</a>). This construction was a continuation of the pattern established by the tabernacle in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33-34</a>). The Most Holy Place symbolized the heavenly throne room of God and foreshadowed the ultimate access to God provided through Jesus Christ, who is described as our high priest (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p><b>its length corresponded to the width of the temple&#8212;twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.</b><br>The dimensions of the Most Holy Place were a perfect cube, measuring twenty cubits by twenty cubits. This symmetry and perfection reflect the divine order and completeness associated with God's presence. The use of the cubit, an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches, indicates that the room was approximately 30 feet by 30 feet. This design mirrors the heavenly city described in <a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>, which is also a perfect cube, symbolizing the ultimate dwelling place of God with humanity.<p><b>And he overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold.</b><br>The overlaying of the Most Holy Place with gold signifies the immense value and purity associated with God's presence. Gold, a symbol of royalty and divinity, was used extensively in the temple's construction, emphasizing the sacredness and glory of the space. Six hundred talents of gold is an enormous quantity, highlighting the wealth and resources dedicated to the temple. This lavish use of gold can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as having a divine nature and being of infinite worth (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>). The use of gold also connects to the heavenly city in Revelation, where the streets are described as pure gold (<a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>), symbolizing the eternal glory and purity of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was tasked with building the temple, fulfilling his father David's vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_holy_place.htm">The Most Holy Place (Holy of Holies)</a></b><br>The innermost and most sacred area of the temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fine_gold_overlay.htm">Fine Gold Overlay</a></b><br>Represents the wealth and splendor dedicated to God, signifying the value and reverence of the sacred space.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>Though not mentioned in this specific verse, it is implied as the central focus of the Most Holy Place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_presence.htm">Reverence for God's Presence</a></b><br>The elaborate design and costly materials of the Most Holy Place remind us of the reverence due to God.
