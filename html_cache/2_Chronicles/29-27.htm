The burnt offering, a central element of Old Testament worship, symbolized atonement and dedication to God. The altar, located in the temple in Jerusalem, was the designated place for such sacrifices, signifying the restoration of covenantal worship. This act reflects Hezekiah's commitment to reestablishing the temple as the center of spiritual life in Judah, aligning with the Mosaic Law (Leviticus 1).<p><b>When the burnt offering began,</b><br>The timing of the burnt offering is significant, marking the commencement of a renewed dedication to God. The beginning of the offering signifies a fresh start for the nation, emphasizing the importance of obedience and worship. This moment is a turning point, highlighting the king's role in leading the people back to God.<p><b>the song of the LORD and the trumpets began as well,</b><br>Music played a vital role in Israelite worship, often accompanying sacrifices and celebrations. The "song of the LORD" likely refers to psalms or hymns sung by the Levites, who were responsible for temple music (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>). Trumpets, used in various religious and military contexts, signaled important events and gathered the people (<a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>). Their use here underscores the solemnity and joy of the occasion, as well as the communal aspect of worship.<p><b>accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.</b><br>David, known for his musical talents and contributions to worship, established the use of instruments in temple services (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>). The reference to David's instruments connects Hezekiah's reforms to the Davidic tradition, emphasizing continuity and faithfulness to God's covenant with David. This connection also foreshadows the Messianic hope, as Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, fulfills the ultimate purpose of temple worship through His sacrifice and reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship in the temple.

The sequence teaches that atonement comes first, praise follows, and both must conform to God&#8217;s revealed pattern.
