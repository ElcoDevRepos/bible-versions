King Asa of Judah sought his help against Baasha, king of Israel, by offering treasures from the temple and his own palace. This alliance reflects the political maneuvering common in the ancient Near East, where smaller kingdoms often sought the support of stronger neighbors. Asa's reliance on a foreign king rather than God is later criticized by the prophet Hanani (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>).<p><b>and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel</b><br>The involvement of Aram's military commanders indicates a formal military campaign. This action demonstrates the strategic importance of alliances and the use of military force to achieve political objectives. The cities targeted were significant for their strategic locations and resources, which would weaken Israel's position.<p><b>conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim</b><br>Ijon, Dan, and Abel-maim were located in the northern part of Israel, in the region of Naphtali. These cities were crucial for controlling trade routes and military movements. Dan, in particular, was a significant city, being the northernmost point of ancient Israel, often mentioned in the phrase "from Dan to Beersheba" to describe the entire land of Israel (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>). The conquest of these cities by Ben-hadad's forces would have been a severe blow to Israel's territorial integrity and economic stability.<p><b>and all the store cities of Naphtali</b><br>Store cities were fortified locations used to store provisions and supplies, essential for sustaining a kingdom's economy and military. Naphtali, being a fertile region, was vital for agriculture and trade. The loss of these cities would have crippled Israel's ability to sustain its population and military efforts. This event underscores the vulnerability of Israel due to internal strife and external threats, highlighting the consequences of Asa's decision to rely on human alliances rather than divine support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who formed an alliance with King Asa of Judah.

Asa&#8217;s wealth bought Ben-hadad&#8217;s ear, unleashing Aramean forces on Israel&#8217;s northern towns and compelling Baasha to abandon his blockade. Outwardly, Judah gained relief; inwardly, Asa forfeited the blessing that had accompanied earlier reliance on the LORD. The passage cautions believers to measure success by faithfulness, not by expedient results, remembering that &#8220;the eyes of the LORD roam throughout the earth to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are fully devoted to Him&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Abel-maim.</span>--Kings, "Abel - beth - maachah" (comp. <a href="/context/2_samuel/20-14.htm" title="And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.">2Samuel 20:14-15</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>). This city is nowhere else called Abel-maim, which is, per haps, an early mistake. The Syriac reads <span class= "ital">Abel-beth-</span> <span class= "ital">maachah.</span><p><span class= "bld">And all the store-cities</span> (<span class= "ital">misk?noth,</span> <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm" title="And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.">2Chronicles 8:4</a>).--Literally, <span class= "ital">And all the stores</span> (magazines) <span class= "ital">of the cities of Naphtali.</span> Kings: "And all <span class= "ital">Cinneroth, with all the</span> <span class= "ital">land</span> of Naphtali." Cinneroth is mentioned (<a href="/joshua/19-35.htm" title="And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,">Joshua 19:35</a>) as a town of Naphtali, and the Sea of Galilee was called the Sea of Cinneroth (<a href="/joshua/12-3.htm" title="And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:">Joshua 12:3</a>). Probably the fertile district west of the lake was also called Cinneroth, and this was the country which Benhadad's army laid waste. The present reading of Chronicles may be either a mere textual corruption, or a paraphrase of that of Kings. Some critics assume its originality, which is less likely. We prefer to regard it as a paraphrase or explanation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Benhadad was apparently not very long in making up either his mind or his method. The bribe that tempted him, drawn from "the treasures" described, well replenished (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-18.htm">2 Chronicles 15:18</a>; and parallel, <a href="/1_kings/15-15.htm">1 Kings 15:15</a>), was probably large. His method was to create a diversion in favour of his new ally, by "smiting" certain picked and highly important cities of Israel, mostly in northern Galilee, by name "Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtalli." <span class="cmt_word">Ijon</span>. In Naphtali, mentioned only now, in the parallel, and when a second time taken (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) by Tiglath-Pileser. <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span>. The colonizing of this city is given in <a href="/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1, 2, 29-31</a>; it was originally called Laish, and became the northern landmark of the whole country, as in the expression, "from Dan even to Beersheba" (Judges 17:29; 20:1). <span class="cmt_word">Abel-maim</span>. This place was situate at the foot of the Lebanon; in the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>) it is called Abel-beth-maachah. It is again mentioned as attacked by Tiglath-Pileser, who wrested it from Pekah (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). In <a href="/2_samuel/20-18.htm">2 Samuel 20:18, 14, 15</a> it is called Abel by itself, but in the last two of these verses Beth-maachah is mentioned in close connection with it. After this name the parallel gives also "all Cinneroth" (Septuagint, "all the land of Cinnereth"). The name is the original of the New Testament <span class="accented">Gennesaret</span>. It was a city (<a href="/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>) that gave its name to the sea and western region of the lake, sometimes called so (<a href="/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>).
