The porters, or burden-bearers, were responsible for transporting materials. This large workforce highlights the immense scale of the temple project. The use of forced labor, often from non-Israelite populations, was common in ancient Near Eastern monarchies. This practice is reminiscent of the Israelites' own experience in Egypt, where they were subjected to hard labor. The number 70,000 signifies the vast resources and manpower Solomon had at his disposal, reflecting his wealth and the importance of the temple project.<p><b>80,000 stonecutters in the mountains</b><br>The stonecutters were skilled laborers tasked with quarrying and shaping stones for the temple's construction. The mention of "in the mountains" suggests that the stones were sourced from specific quarries, possibly in the region of Lebanon, known for its high-quality building materials. This aligns with the biblical account of Solomon's alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who provided cedar and skilled workers. The use of stone in temple construction symbolizes permanence and strength, qualities associated with God's eternal presence. The labor-intensive process of stonecutting underscores the dedication and effort required to build a house for the Lord.<p><b>and 3,600 supervisors</b><br>The supervisors were likely responsible for overseeing the laborers and ensuring the quality and progress of the work. This hierarchical structure reflects the organized and efficient approach Solomon took in managing the temple project. The number 3,600 indicates a significant administrative effort, necessary for coordinating such a large workforce. This mirrors the wisdom and administrative skills attributed to Solomon, as seen in his ability to govern Israel effectively. The role of supervisors also points to the importance of leadership and accountability in fulfilling God's purposes, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.
