This reflects his significant influence and leadership in Judah, particularly during the reign of King Joash. The City of David, located in Jerusalem, was the burial site for the kings of Judah, emphasizing Jehoiada's esteemed status. His role in preserving the Davidic line by protecting Joash from Queen Athaliah's massacre (<a href="/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11:1-3</a>) and his guidance in restoring the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4-14</a>) were pivotal in maintaining the spiritual and political stability of the nation.<p><b>because he had done what was good in Israel</b><br>Jehoiada's actions were seen as righteous and beneficial for the nation of Israel, which in this context refers to the southern kingdom of Judah. His leadership was marked by a return to covenant faithfulness, including the renewal of the covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-16.htm">2 Chronicles 23:16</a>). His influence led to the destruction of Baal worship and the restoration of proper worship practices, aligning with the Deuteronomic emphasis on covenant loyalty (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>).<p><b>for God and His temple</b><br>Jehoiada's dedication to God and the temple underscores his commitment to the spiritual welfare of Judah. He orchestrated the repair and maintenance of the temple, ensuring that it remained the center of worship and national identity (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-12.htm">2 Chronicles 24:12-14</a>). This focus on the temple prefigures the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ as the ultimate high priest and the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), highlighting the continuity of God's redemptive plan through the preservation of worship and covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>A high priest who played a crucial role in preserving the Davidic line by protecting Joash, the rightful heir to the throne, from Queen Athaliah's massacre.
