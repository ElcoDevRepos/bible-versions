Baptism, in the early church, was a public declaration of faith and symbolized the believer's union with Christ in His death and burial. The act of immersion in water represents the burial of the old self, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>, which parallels this concept. The imagery of burial underscores the finality of the believer's separation from the old life of sin. Historically, baptism was a significant rite in the early Christian community, often performed in natural bodies of water or specially constructed baptisteries, symbolizing purification and initiation into the faith.<p><b>you were raised with Him</b><br>This phrase highlights the believer's participation in Christ's resurrection. Just as Christ was raised from the dead, believers are spiritually resurrected to a new life. This transformation is not merely symbolic but is a real change in the believer's spiritual state, as emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>. The resurrection is central to Christian doctrine, affirming Jesus' victory over sin and death, and it assures believers of their future resurrection. The concept of being raised with Christ also implies a new identity and purpose, aligning with the teachings of <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a> about becoming a new creation.<p><b>through your faith in the power of God</b><br>Faith is the means by which believers access the transformative power of God. This phrase underscores the necessity of personal faith in experiencing the realities of spiritual resurrection and new life. The power of God, which raised Jesus from the dead, is the same power at work in believers, as noted in <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>. This power is not dependent on human effort but is a divine gift, accessible through faith. The emphasis on faith aligns with the broader biblical narrative that salvation and transformation are by grace through faith, as articulated in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>who raised Him from the dead</b><br>This final phrase affirms the historical and theological cornerstone of Christianity: the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The resurrection is a well-documented event in the New Testament, with multiple eyewitness accounts, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-8</a>. It serves as the ultimate validation of Jesus' divine nature and the truth of His teachings. The resurrection is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, and typologies, like Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). This act of God not only confirms Jesus' victory over death but also guarantees the believer's future resurrection and eternal life, as promised in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, addressing the church in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose death, burial, and resurrection are foundational to the faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who raised Jesus from the dead, demonstrating His power and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/baptism.htm">Baptism</a></b><br>A Christian sacrament of initiation and purification, symbolizing the believer's identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_baptism.htm">Understanding Baptism</a></b><br>Baptism is not just a ritual but a profound spiritual reality that signifies our union with Christ in His death and resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_power.htm">Faith and Power</a></b><br>Our faith in the power of God is essential for experiencing the new life that comes through Christ's resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_the_resurrected_life.htm">Living the Resurrected Life</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live in the reality of being raised with Christ, which means walking in newness of life and leaving behind our old sinful ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_god's_power.htm">The Role of God&#8217;s Power</a></b><br>Recognize that it is God's power that raised Jesus from the dead, and it is the same power at work in us to transform and sustain us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Our identity is now rooted in Christ's death and resurrection, which should shape our values, actions, and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Colossians_2_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Colossians 2:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Colossians_2_12_Baptism_s_significance.htm">How does Colossians 2:12 illustrate the significance of baptism in Christian life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Implications_of_being_raised_with_Him.htm">What does being "raised with Him" imply about our spiritual transformation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Romans_6_4_Col_2_12_Baptism_link.htm">How does Romans 6:4 connect with Colossians 2:12 on baptism symbolism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_live_daily_in_God_s_power.htm">How can we live daily as those "raised through faith" in God's power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_faith_impact_God_s_power.htm">What role does faith play in experiencing the power of God mentioned here?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Colossians_2_12_and_spiritual_rebirth.htm">How does Colossians 2:12 relate to the concept of spiritual rebirth in Christianity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Colossians_2_12_Baptism_s_significance_2.htm">What is the significance of baptism as described in Colossians 2:12?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Link_Col_2_12_faith_Jesus_resurrection.htm">How does Colossians 2:12 connect faith and the resurrection of Jesus?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_colossians_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Colossians 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_is_it_for_brethren_to_unite.htm">What does it mean to be hidden with Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_are_baptism_and_circumcision_linked.htm">How are baptism and circumcision connected?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_is_'buried_with_christ'_reconciled.htm">Romans 6:3&#8211;4 mentions being &#8220;buried with Christ&#8221; through baptism.

Baptism pictures the reality, but God&#8217;s action makes it reality. The verse invites us to rest in what He has done, walk in newness of life, and look forward to the day our bodies will match the resurrection life already pulsing in our hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Buried with him in baptism . . .</span>--It is very interesting to compare this passage with <a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>, "Therefore we are buried with Him in baptism unto death, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life." In the former clause both are identical. In the latter clause this Epistle is stronger. What in the earlier Epistle is the "likeness of His Resurrection" is here the participation of it, "Ye are risen with Him." Similarly, instead of the simple allusion to "Christ's being raised from the dead," we have here "through faith in the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead." Here, as in the more detailed passage of the Ephesian Epistle (<a href="/context/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19-23</a>; <a href="/context/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5-7</a>), the "operation," the energy of "the mighty power of God," is conceived as actually working both in the Head and in the Body, so that wo through it partake of the resurrection, the ascension, and the glorified majesty of Christ. The comparison shows an instructive development in this Epistle of the consequences of the unity with Christ.<p>This passage is also notable for the obvious contrast of baptism, as a spiritual reality, with circumcision as a symbolic form. Each is the entrance into a covenant with God; but the one into a covenant of "the letter," and the other into a covenant of "the spirit." (See the contrast between the covenants drawn out in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6-18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>.) In the earlier Epistles circumcision is contrasted with spiritual regeneration (<a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>), as shown by various signs, such as "faith working by love" (<a href="/context/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9-12</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>), or "keeping the commandments of God" (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>). Here this contrast is still as strong as ever; but baptism being (as always) looked upon as the means of such spiritual regeneration, is brought out emphatically as "the circumcision of the Spirit." As baptised into Christ, "we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit" (<a href="/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Philippians 3:3</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - When ye were (literally, <span class="accented">having been</span>) buried with him in your baptism (ver. 20; <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26, 27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the rarer form of the word, is preferred by Tregelles, Alford, Lightfoot (see his note), being found in Codex B, with other good authorities; it indicates the process ("in your baptizing"). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the usual form of the word, is retained by Revisers, after Tischendorf, Ellicott, Westcott and Herr. <span class="accented">Baptism</span> stands for the entire change of the man which it symbolizes and seals (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-5</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>).

In which (or, <span class="accented">whom</span>) also ye were raised with (him), through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6, 8</a>; <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24, 25</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>). We refer the relative pronoun to the immediately antecedent "baptism," although the previous <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span> refers to "Christ" (ver. 11: comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>) and some good interpreters follow the rendering "in whom." For the Christian's <span class="accented">being raised with Christ</span> is not contrasted with his <span class="accented">circumcision</span> (ver. 11) - that figure has been dismissed - but with <span class="accented">his burial in baptism</span> (ver. 12 a); so Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Revisers. "Having been buried" is replaced in the antithesis by the more assertive "ye were raised" (comp. vers. 13, 14; <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 26</a>). "With" points to the "him" (Christ) of the previous clause (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>). <span class="accented">Faith</span> is the instrumental cause of that which baptism sets forth (comp. <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26, 27</a>), and has for its object (not its cause: so Bengel) "the working" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: see note, <a href="/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>; also <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>) "of God." And the special Divine work on which it rests is "the resurrection of Christ" (<a href="/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24, 25</a>; <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-13.htm">1 Corinthians 15:13-17</a>): comp. note on "Firstborn out of the dead," <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>. Rising from the baptismal waters, the Christian convert declares the faith of his heart in that supreme act of God, which attests and makes sure all that he has bestowed upon us in his Son (<a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12-14</a>: comp. <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; also <a href="/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>; <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33, 38</a>, etc.). Baptism symbolizes all that circumcision did, and more. It expresses more fully than the older sacrament our parting with the life of sin; and also that of which circumcision knew nothing - the union of the man with the dying and risen Christ, which makes him "dead unto sin, and alive unto God." How needless, then, even if it were legitimate, for a Christian to return to this superseded rite! To heighten his readers' sense of the reality and completeness of the change which as baptized (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">believing</span>) Christians they bad undergone, he describes it now more directly as matter of personal experience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">having been buried with</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#966;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(syntaphentes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4916.htm">Strong's 4916: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bury along with.
