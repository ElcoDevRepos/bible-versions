In biblical context, "walk" often symbolizes one's conduct or way of life (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>). The idea of being "worthy" suggests living in a way that honors and glorifies God, aligning with His will and purpose. This reflects the transformation expected of believers, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, where Paul urges believers to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. The cultural context of the early church, surrounded by pagan practices, required a distinct lifestyle that set Christians apart, demonstrating their commitment to Christ.<p><b>and may please Him in every way:</b><br>Pleasing God involves obedience and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith, it is impossible to please God. This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of a believer's life, where every action, thought, and intention should aim to honor God. The historical context of the Colossian church, facing false teachings and pressures to conform to societal norms, highlights the importance of steadfastness in faith. Pleasing God is not about legalistic adherence to rules but about a heartfelt desire to align with His will, as Jesus exemplified in <a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>.<p><b>bearing fruit in every good work,</b><br>The metaphor of bearing fruit is common in Scripture, symbolizing the visible evidence of a believer's faith and the work of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). In the agricultural society of the time, fruitfulness was a sign of health and productivity. This phrase calls believers to engage in actions that reflect their faith, contributing to the growth of God's kingdom. The connection to <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the vine and believers as the branches, emphasizes the necessity of remaining in Christ to produce fruit. Good works are not the means of salvation but the natural outcome of a life transformed by grace.<p><b>growing in the knowledge of God,</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of spiritual growth and understanding of God's nature and will. Knowledge of God is not merely intellectual but relational, involving a deepening intimacy with Him. The early church faced challenges from Gnostic teachings that claimed special knowledge; thus, Paul emphasizes true knowledge rooted in Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-3</a>). This growth is facilitated by studying Scripture, prayer, and fellowship with other believers. The pursuit of knowing God more fully is a lifelong journey, as seen in <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>, where Paul expresses his desire to know Christ and the power of His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians, addressing the church in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>- An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the church to whom Paul wrote was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_colossian_church.htm">The Colossian Church</a></b><br>- The recipients of Paul's letter, a group of believers facing challenges from false teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>- The central figure of the Christian faith, whom believers are called to follow and please.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostle's_prayer.htm">The Apostle's Prayer</a></b><br>- The context of this verse is part of Paul's prayer for the Colossians, emphasizing spiritual growth and maturity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/walking_worthy_of_the_lord.htm">Walking Worthy of the Lord</a></b><br>Our daily conduct should reflect the character and teachings of Jesus Christ.

"The Lord" is here, as usual, the Lord Jesus Christ; to walk worthy of Him is to have His life reproduced in us, to follow His example, to have "the mind of Christ Jesus." The "worthiness" is, of course, relative to our capacity, not absolute.<p><span class= "bld">All pleasing.</span>--The word here used is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but is employed in classic and Hellenistic Greek to mean "a general disposition to please"--a constant preference of the will of others before our own. It is here used with tacit reference to God, since towards Him alone can it be a safe guide of action. Otherwise it must have the bad sense which in general usage was attached to it. St. Paul emphatically disowns and condemns the temper of "men-pleasing" (see <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-6.htm" title="Not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1Thessalonians 2:4</a>), as incompatible with being "the servant of Christ." He could, indeed, "be all things to all men" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm" title="To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.">1Corinthians 9:22</a>); he could bid each man "please his neighbour for his edification" (<a href="/romans/15-12.htm" title="And again, Esaias said, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.">Romans 15:12</a>). But the only "pleasing" to which the whole life can be conformed is (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1</a>) the consideration "how we ought to walk and to please God." Only in subordination to this can we safely act on the desire of "all pleasing" towards men. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing</span> (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5, 11</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-21.htm">Hebrews 13:21</a>); so <span class="accented">as to please him in every way.</span> "The end of all knowledge, the apostle would say, is conduct" (Lightfoot). Spiritual enlightenment (ver. 9) enables the Christian to <span class="accented">walk</span> (a Hebraism adopted also into biblical English) in a way "worthy of the Lord" (Christ, <a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-24.htm">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>, etc.), becoming those who have such a Lord and who profess to be his servants. And to be "worthy of Christ" is to "please God" (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4, 5, 11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>). This is the ideal and the aim of the religious life throughout the Bible (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5, 6</a>; <a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>; <a href="/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8</a>). The characteristics of this walk are set forth by three coordinate participial phrases (vers. 10b-12), standing in the half independent nominative case instead of the more regular accusative (as agreeing with the understood object of the infinitive <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: see Winer's ' N.

"Good work" is that which is <span class="accented">beneficial, practically good</span> (see parallel passages). "In every good work" might grammatically qualify the foregoing" pleasing ' (so R.V. margin and many older interpreters), but appears to be parallel in position and sense with "in all power" (ver. 11).
