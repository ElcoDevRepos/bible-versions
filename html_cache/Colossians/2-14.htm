In the ancient world, debts were often recorded on a certificate or a written document. The concept of canceling a debt would resonate with the Colossians, as it implies a complete removal of the obligation. Biblically, this aligns with the idea of forgiveness and redemption, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, where God removes our transgressions from us.<p><b>ascribed to us in the decrees</b><br>The "decrees" refer to the legal demands of the Mosaic Law, which highlighted human sinfulness and the need for atonement. These decrees were a constant reminder of humanity's inability to achieve righteousness on their own. Historically, the Jewish law was seen as a binding contract between God and His people, and failure to adhere to it resulted in spiritual debt. This phrase underscores the universality of sin and the law's role in pointing out the need for a savior, as echoed in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>.<p><b>that stood against us</b><br>The decrees not only highlighted sin but also acted as a barrier between humanity and God. This phrase suggests an adversarial position, where the law, while holy and just, ultimately condemns because of human inability to fulfill it. This is reminiscent of the imagery in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-15</a>, where Christ breaks down the dividing wall of hostility, reconciling humanity to God.<p><b>He took it away</b><br>This action signifies the removal of the barrier of sin and the law's condemnation through Christ's sacrificial death. The phrase emphasizes the completeness of Christ's work in salvation, as He actively removes the obstacle that separates humanity from God. This is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-6</a>, where the suffering servant bears the iniquities of many.<p><b>nailing it to the cross!</b><br>The imagery of nailing to the cross is powerful, as crucifixion was a method of execution reserved for the most serious offenses in the Roman world. By using this metaphor, the text illustrates that Christ's crucifixion was the means by which the legal demands of the law were satisfied. This act symbolizes the public display of victory over sin and death, akin to the triumphal procession described in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>. The cross becomes the pivotal point of redemption, where Jesus, the ultimate type of sacrificial lamb, fulfills the requirements of the law and offers reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians, addressing issues of false teachings and emphasizing the supremacy of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor where the church addressed in this letter was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, whose sacrificial death on the cross is the means by which the "debt" is canceled.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The instrument of Christ's crucifixion, symbolizing the place where the debt of sin was nailed and dealt with.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_decrees.htm">The Decrees</a></b><br>Refers to the legal demands or ordinances that were against us, often understood as the Mosaic Law or the record of our sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_debt.htm">Understanding Our Debt</a></b><br>Recognize that the "debt" refers to the legal and moral obligations we failed to meet due to sin.

Because the ledger is canceled and publicly displayed as paid in full, believers now live free from guilt&#8217;s weight and Law&#8217;s condemnation, walking in the liberty purchased by the Savior&#8217;s finished work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Blotting out the handwriting</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, <span class= "ital">cancelling the bond which stood against us in its ordinances.</span> The "handwriting" is the bond, exacting payment or penalty in default. (Comp. <a href="/philemon/1-19.htm" title="I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.">Philemon 1:19</a>, "I Paul have <span class= "ital">written it with mine own hand;</span> I will repay it.") What this bond is we see by <a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>, which speaks of "the law of commandments in ordinances," there called "the enmity slain by the cross." On the meaning of "ordinances" see Note on that passage. The metaphor, however, here is different, and especially notable as the first anticipation of those many metaphors of later theology, from Tertullian downwards, in which the idea of a debt to God, paid for us by the blood of Christ, as "a satisfaction," is brought out. The Law is a bond, "Do this and thou shalt live." "The soul that sinneth it shall die." On failure to do our part it "stands against us." But God for Christ's sake forgives our transgressions and cancels the bond. It is a striking metaphor, full of graphic expressiveness; it is misleading only when (as in some later theologies) we hold it to be not only the truth, but the whole truth, forgetting that legal and forensic metaphors can but imperfectly represent inner spiritual realities.<p><span class= "bld">And took it.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">and He</span> (Christ) <span class= "ital">hath taken it away.</span> The change of tense is significant. The act of atonement is over; its effect remains.<p><span class= "bld">Nailing it to his cross.</span>--At this point the idea of atonement comes in. Hitherto we have heard simply of free forgiveness and love of God. Now the bond is viewed, not as cancelled by a simple act of divine mercy, but as absolutely destroyed by Christ, by "nailing it to His cross." It has been supposed (as by Bishop Pearson) that there is allusion to some custom of cancelling documents by the striking of a nail through them. But the custom is doubtful, and the supposition unnecessary. Our Lord "redeemed us from the curse of the Law," by His death, "being made a curse for us" (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>). St. Paul boldly speaks of that curse as a penalty standing against us, and as nailed to the cross with Himself, so to be for ever cancelled in the great declaration, "It is finished." If any more definite allusion is to be sought for, we might be inclined to refer to the "title" on the cross, probably nailed to it. Such title declared the explanation of the sufferer's death. The cancelled curse of the Law was just such an explanation of the great atoning death, and the title, declaring His mediatorial kingdom, showed the curse cancelled thereby.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having blotted out the bond</span> (that was) <span class="cmt_word">against us with</span> (or, <span class="accented">written in</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>decrees, which was opposed to us</span> (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>; <a href="/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9-26</a>; <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10-22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38, 39</a>).

"God," not "Christ," is the subject of this verb, which stands in immediate sequence to those of vers. 12, 13 (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>). It is <span class="accented">the receiver</span> rather than <span class="accented">the offerer</span> of satisfaction who cancels the debt: in <a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a> (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>) a different verb is used. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("handwritten;" a word of later Greek, only here in the New Testament) is used specially <span class="accented">of an account of debt, a bond signed by the debtor's hand</span> (see Meyer and Lightfoot). This <span class="accented">bond</span> (with its <span class="accented">decrees</span>) can be nothing other than "the law" (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>; <a href="/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38, 39</a>; <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21, 22</a>, etc.); not, however, <span class="accented">the ritual law</span>, nor even <span class="accented">the Mosaic Law</span> as such (as Meyer contends), but <span class="accented">law as law</span>, the Divine rule of human life impressed even on Gentile hearts (<a href="/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14, 15</a>), to which man's conscience gives its consent (<a href="/romans/7-16.htm">Romans 7:16, 22</a>), and yet which becomes by his disobedience just a list of charges against him (so Neander and Lightfoot; see the latter on <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>). <a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14-26</a>, indeed, illustrate this wider relation of Divine law to the human conscience generally. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is dative of reference either to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> ("against us:" qualifying or explanatory - <span class="accented">in respect of its decrees</span>) or to the verbal idea contained in <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("written in," or "with decrees"). The former explanation (that of Winer and Ellicott) is preferable. The Greek Fathers made it instrumental dative to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, understanding by these <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;</span> (<span class="accented">dogmas</span>) <span class="accented">of the gospel by which the charges of the Law against us are expunged.</span> But this puts on <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> a later theological sense foreign to St. Paul, and universally rejected by modern interpreters. In the New Testament (comp. <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm">Hebrews 11:23</a>), as in classical Greek, <span class="accented">dogma</span> is <span class="accented">a decree</span>, setting forth the will of some public authority (comp. note on <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, ver. 20). The added clause, "which was opposed to us," affirms the active opposition, as "against us" the essential hostility of the decrees of God's law to our sinful nature (<a href="/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>: comp. <a href="/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13, 14</a>). The emphasis with which St. Paul dwells on this point is characteristic of the author of Romans and Galatians. <span class="greek">&#x3a8;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> occurs besides only in <a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>; the prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> implies close and persistent opposition (Lightfoot). <span class="cmt_word">And he hath taken it out of the midst, having nailed it to the cross</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>; <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>). A third time in these three verses (12-14) we note the transition from participle to coordinate finite verb; and here, in addition, the aorist tense passes into the perfect ("hath taken"), marking the finality of the removal of the Law's condemning power (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>): comp. the opposite transition in <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>. The <span class="accented">moral deliverance</span> of ver. 11 is traced up to this <span class="accented">legal release</span>, both contained in our completeness in Christ (ver. 10). The subject is still "God." <span class="accented">Cancelling the bond</span> which he held against us in his Law, God has forver <span class="accented">removed the barrier</span> which stood between mankind and himself (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>). <span class="accented">Christ's</span> place in this work, already shown in <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18-23</a> (in its relation to <span class="accented">himself</span>), is vividly recalled by the mention of <span class="accented">the cross.</span> And the abolition of the Law's condemnation is finally set forth by a yet bolder metaphor - <span class="accented">"having nailed</span> it to the cross." The nails of the cross in piercing Christ pierced the legal instrument which held us debtors, and nullified it; see <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> (comp. <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>); <a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4-6</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> may suggest the further idea of <span class="accented">nailing up</span> the cancelled document, by way of publication. At the cross all may read, "There is now no condemnation" (compare the "making a show" of ver. 15; also <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>).
