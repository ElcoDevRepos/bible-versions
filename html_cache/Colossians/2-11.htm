In the Old Testament, physical circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). It was an outward sign of belonging to God's chosen people. However, in the New Testament, the focus shifts to a spiritual circumcision of the heart (<a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>), symbolizing the believer's separation from sin and dedication to God. This spiritual circumcision is not a physical act but a transformation that occurs through faith in Christ.<p><b>in the putting off of your sinful nature</b><br>The "putting off" refers to the removal or stripping away of the sinful nature, often described as the "flesh" in biblical terms. This concept is rooted in the idea of dying to one's old self and being reborn in Christ (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>). The sinful nature, characterized by rebellion against God and inclination towards sin, is symbolically removed through the believer's identification with Christ's death and resurrection. This transformation is a key aspect of the believer's sanctification process, where they are progressively made holy.<p><b>with the circumcision performed by Christ</b><br>This circumcision is not a physical act but a spiritual one, accomplished by Christ Himself. It signifies the believer's complete identification with Christ's death and resurrection. Through His sacrificial death, Jesus fulfilled the requirements of the law and provided a way for believers to be spiritually renewed (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>). This act of spiritual circumcision is a divine work, emphasizing that salvation and sanctification are initiated and completed by Christ, not by human effort.<p><b>and not by human hands</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine nature of the spiritual circumcision believers undergo. Unlike the physical circumcision performed by human hands, this transformation is a supernatural work of God. It highlights the insufficiency of human rituals and efforts in achieving true spiritual renewal. This aligns with the broader New Testament teaching that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The emphasis is on the inward change brought about by the Holy Spirit, rather than external religious observances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians, addressing issues of false teachings and emphasizing the supremacy of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor where the church addressed in this letter was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose spiritual circumcision is discussed in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>A physical act in Jewish tradition symbolizing the covenant with God, here used metaphorically to describe a spiritual transformation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sinful_nature.htm">Sinful Nature</a></b><br>The inherent human tendency to sin, which believers are called to put off through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_transformation_over_physical_rituals.htm">Spiritual Transformation Over Physical Rituals</a></b><br>The circumcision mentioned in <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a> is not a physical act but a spiritual transformation performed by Christ.

The phrase "made without hands" is so constantly used of heavenly realities (as in <a href="/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>), as opposed to earthly symbols, that it comes to have the positive sense of "spiritual." It is defined below as "the circumcision of Christ"--that which Christ has given us in Himself--in contradistinction to the old circumcision which is now "nothing."

"The stripping off of the body" was the ideal of the philosophical ascetics (see note on "body," ver. 23, and quotations from Philo). The apostle adds "of the flesh;" <span class="accented">i.e. of the body in so far as it was the body of the flesh</span> (vers. Colossians 2:13, 18, 23; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). "The flesh" (in <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a> that which Christ had <span class="accented">put on</span>; here that which the Christian <span class="accented">puts off:</span> comp. <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>) is "the flesh of sin," of <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>, etc. "The body," while identified with this "flesh," is "the body of sin" and "of death" (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>; see Meyer, Godet, or Beet); sin inhabits it, clothes itself with it, and presents itself to us in its form; and this being the normal condition of unregenerate human nature, the sinful principle is naturally called <span class="accented">the flesh.</span> So "the (bodily) members" become "the members that are upon the earth," employed in the pursuit of lust and greed, till they become practically one with these vices (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>, see note; also <a href="/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5, 23</a>). Yet "the body" and "the (sinful) flesh," while in the natural man one in practice, are in principle distinguishable (ver. 23: comp. <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>], and separable (<a href="/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12</a>). The deliverance from the physical acts and habits of the old sinful life, experienced by him who is "in Christ" (ver. 10; <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>), is "the circumcision according to the Christ," or here more pointedly "of Christ" - a real and complete, instead of a partial and symbolic, putting away of the organic life and domination of sin which made the body its seat and its instrument. The genitive" of Christ <span class="accented">"is</span> neither objective ("undergone by Christ"), nor subjective ("wrought by Christ"), but stands in a mere general relation - "belonging to Christ," "the Christian circumcision."
