It serves as a transition, urging believers to apply the truths previously discussed.<p><b>just as you have received Christ Jesus as Lord,</b><br>Receiving Christ Jesus as Lord implies a personal acceptance and acknowledgment of His authority and divinity. This phrase underscores the initial act of faith and conversion, where believers accept Jesus not only as Savior but as the sovereign ruler of their lives. This reflects the early Christian confession found in <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>, "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."<p><b>continue to walk in Him,</b><br>The call to "continue to walk in Him" emphasizes the ongoing nature of the Christian life. Walking in Christ involves living in a manner consistent with His teachings and character. This is a common biblical metaphor for living a life of faith and obedience, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>, "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh." It suggests a daily, active relationship with Christ, marked by growth and perseverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, writing to encourage and instruct the believers in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the recipients of this letter resided.

Scripture often uses the same pivot, moving from truth to application. &#8220;Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, urge you to walk worthy of the calling you have received&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>). <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> does it as well, urging a living sacrifice &#8220;in view of God&#8217;s mercy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The message: because of the unshakable realities about Christ, something practical must follow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as you have received</b><p>&#8226; Salvation is pictured as receiving a gift. <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a> affirms, &#8220;But to all who did receive Him&#8230; He gave the right to become children of God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Colossians had embraced Jesus by faith, not by works. Paul reminds them that the same faith by which they began is the faith by which they must go on. <a href="/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a> asks, &#8220;Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?&#8221; The answer guides today&#8217;s walk: it remains faith-based, grace-powered.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: remember how helpless, yet hopeful, you were when you first believed. Keep that posture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Christ Jesus as Lord</b><p>&#8226; The full title matters. &#8220;Christ&#8221; points to the promised Messiah; &#8220;Jesus&#8221; to the historical Savior; &#8220;Lord&#8221; to His present, absolute authority. <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a> declares, &#8220;God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Confessing His lordship is inseparable from genuine faith. <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a> says, &#8220;If you confess with your mouth, &#8216;Jesus is Lord,&#8217; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a> broadens the view: every knee will bow and every tongue will confess Him.

Such a <span class="accented">walk</span> will be consistent with their previous steadfastness, and will lead them to larger spiritual attainments (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; see note). "Ye received" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as in <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>: comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>) reminds the Colossians of what they had received (compare" ye were taught," ver. 7 and <a href="/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>) rather than of the way of their receiving it. "Christ Jesus the Lord," is literally, <span class="accented">the Christ Jesus, the Lord</span> - an expression found besides only in <a href="/ephesians/3-11.htm">Ephesians 3:11</a> (Revised Text). The prefixed article points out <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> in his full style and title as the Person whom the Colossians had received, and received as <span class="accented">the Lord.</span> "The Lord" has a predicative force, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> (R.V.); <a href="/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>. "Jesus is Lord" was the testing watchword applied in the discerning of spirits; "Jesus Christ is Lord" is to be the final confession of a reconciled universe; and "Christ Jesus is Lord" is the rule of faith that guides all conduct and tests all doctrine within the Church (comp. ver. 19; <a href="/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>). It is "a summary of the whole Christian confession" (Meyer). To vindicate this lordship, on which the Colossian error trenched so seriously, is the main object of the Epistle (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-20</a>). We must not, therefore, with Alford, Lightfoot, Hofmann, analyze "the Christ Jesus:" "Ye received the Christ, (namely) Jesus, who is the Lord." The writer has already used "Christ Jesus" as a single proper name at the outset (<a href="/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1, 4</a>); and it was the <span class="accented">lordship of Christ Jesus, not the Messiahship of Jesus</span>, that was now in question. In <a href="/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5, 28</a> the situation is entirely different. In the following clause, "in him" is emphatic, as in ver. 7 (compare the predominant <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-22</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9-15</a>). Hence the contradiction of figure, "walk, rooted, and builded up," does not obtrude itself. (On "walk," see note, <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; and on "in Christ" in this connection, see notes, <a href="/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; and comp. <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-11</a>; <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-7</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
