The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's emotions and will. Encouragement here implies a strengthening or fortifying of their faith amidst challenges. This aligns with Paul's broader mission to support and uplift the early church, as seen in his other letters (e.g., <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>). The encouragement is not merely emotional but deeply spiritual, aimed at fostering resilience against false teachings.<p><b>knit together in love</b><br>The imagery of being "knit together" suggests a close, inseparable bond among believers, akin to the intricate weaving of fabric. Love is the binding force, reflecting the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>) and the new commandment given by Jesus (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>). This unity in love is essential for the church's strength and witness, as it mirrors the unity within the Godhead and the love of Christ for His church (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>).<p><b>and filled with the full riches of complete understanding</b><br>Paul emphasizes the abundance and depth of spiritual insight available to believers. This understanding is not superficial but comprehensive, encompassing the wisdom and knowledge found in Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>). The "riches" suggest the invaluable nature of this understanding, which surpasses worldly wisdom and is rooted in divine revelation. This aligns with the biblical theme of seeking wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/2.htm">Proverbs 2:1-6</a>) and the transformative power of renewing the mind (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><b>so that they may know the mystery of God</b><br>The term "mystery" in Paul's writings often refers to truths once hidden but now revealed through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4-6</a>). This mystery encompasses God's redemptive plan for humanity, which was fulfilled in Jesus. Understanding this mystery is crucial for the Colossians to stand firm against deceptive philosophies and to grasp the fullness of their salvation. It highlights the progressive revelation of God's plan throughout Scripture, culminating in the New Testament.<p><b>namely Christ</b><br>Christ is the focal point of God's mystery and the embodiment of divine wisdom and knowledge. In Him, the fullness of God dwells bodily (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>), and through Him, believers have access to all spiritual blessings (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>). This statement underscores the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ, countering any teachings that diminish His role or suggest additional requirements for salvation. It affirms the centrality of Christ in the believer's life and the church's doctrine, as echoed throughout the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, writing to encourage and instruct the believers in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the church addressed in this letter was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_colossian_church.htm">The Colossian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a group of believers facing challenges from false teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to the mystery of God, whom Paul emphasizes as the source of wisdom and knowledge.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the backdrop against which Paul writes, as they were promoting deceptive philosophies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_heart.htm">Encouragement in Heart</a></b><br>Believers should seek to uplift one another, fostering a community where hearts are strengthened through mutual support and encouragement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_love.htm">Unity in Love</a></b><br>The church is called to be united in love, transcending differences and focusing on the common bond in Christ, which is essential for spiritual growth and understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/riches_of_understanding.htm">Riches of Understanding</a></b><br>True spiritual wealth comes from a deep understanding of Christ, who is the mystery of God.

The <span class="accented">heart</span>, in Biblical language, is not the seat of feeling only, but stands for the whole inner man, as the "vital centre" of his personality (see Back's 'Biblical Psychology:' comp. <a href="/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19, 21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">While they are</span> (literally, <span class="accented">they having been</span>) <span class="cmt_word">drawn together in love, and into all</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">riches of the full assurance of the understanding, unto</span> (or, <span class="accented">into</span>) (full) <span class="cmt_word">knowledge of the mystery of God,</span> (even) <span class="cmt_word">Christ</span> (ver. 19; <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10, 14</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17, 18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2, 3, 15, 16</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>). In the best Greek copies "drawn together" is nominative masculine, agreeing with "they," the logical subject implied in "their <span class="accented">hearts"</span> (feminine). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> has the same sense in ver. 19 and <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a> it is quoted from the LXX in another sense; and it has a variety of meanings in the Acts. "Drawn together" expresses the double sense which accrues to the verb in combination with the two prepositions "in" and "into:" "united <span class="accented">in</span> love," Christians are prepared to be "led <span class="accented">into</span> all the wealth of Divine knowledge." This combination of "love and knowledge" appears in all St. Paul's letters of this period (comp. <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12-16</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>; and contrast <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1, 2, 8-13</a>). "The riches of the full assurance," etc., and "the knowledge of the mystery" are the counterpart of "the riches of the glory of the mystery," of <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; the fulness of conviction and completeness of knowledge attainable by the Christian correspond to the full and satisfying character of the revelation he receives in Christ (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-19</a>). (On "understanding," see note, <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>.) "Full assurance," or "conviction" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), is a word belonging to St. Luke and St. Paul (with the Epistle to the Hebrews) in the New Testament (not found in classical Greek), and denotes radically "a bringing to fall measure or maturity." Combined with "understanding," it denotes the ripe, intelligent persuasion of one who enters into the whole wealth of the "truth as it is in Jesus" (comp. <a href="/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>, R.V.; also <a href="/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a> and Romans 14:5, for corresponding verb). In this inward "assurance," as in a fortress, the Colossians were to entrench themselves against the attacks of error (<a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>, and notes). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is either in explanatory apposition to the previous clause, or rather donors the <span class="accented">further purpose</span> for which this wealth of conviction is to be sought: "knowledge of the Divine mystery, knowledge of Christ" - this is the supreme end, ever leading on and upward, for the pursuit of which all strengthening of heart and understanding are given (<a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-19</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The Revisers have corrected the erroneous "acknowledgment" by their paraphrastic rendering, "that they may know." (On <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 3), see note, <a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>.) The object of this knowledge is the great <span class="accented">manifested mystery</span> of God, namely <span class="accented">Christ</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). We confidently accept here the Revised reading, that of nearly all recent textual critics, which omits the words found in the Received Text between "God" and "Christ." There are extant eleven distinct variations of this reading, and that of the Textus Receptus is, to all appearance, the latest and worst; "the passage is altogether an instructive lesson on textual criticism" (Lightfoot, pp. 252, 253; also Westcott and Hort, 'Introduction: Notes on Selected Readings,' pp. 125, 126). The words thus read have been interpreted mystery of the God Christ" (the Latin Hilary, and a few moderns); of the God of Christ" (Meyer, quoting <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>); - both interpretations grammatically correct, but unsuitable here, even if in harmony with Pauline usage elsewhere. Alford omits "of Christ" altogether, distrusting the textual evidence. Meyer objects to the rendering we have followed (that of Ellicott, Lightfoot, Revisers), that the apostle, if this be his meaning, has expressed himself ambiguously; but comp. <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a> (see note); also <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, "The mystery, <span class="accented">who was</span> manifested in flesh." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
