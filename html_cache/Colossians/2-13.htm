Biblically, "dead" signifies separation from God due to sin (<a href="/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>). Trespasses refer to specific acts of disobedience against God's law. The imagery of death underscores the inability of humans to save themselves, emphasizing the need for divine intervention. This concept is rooted in the fall of man (Genesis 3), where sin entered the world, resulting in spiritual death.<p><b>and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature</b><br>Here, "uncircumcision" symbolizes a state of being outside the covenant community of Israel, who were marked by physical circumcision as a sign of their relationship with God (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). In the New Testament, this term is used metaphorically to describe a heart not yet transformed by God (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>). The "sinful nature" refers to the inherent inclination towards sin that all humans possess due to the fall. This phrase emphasizes the Gentile believers' previous alienation from God and His promises.<p><b>God made you alive with Christ</b><br>This statement reflects the transformative power of God's grace. The act of being "made alive" signifies spiritual regeneration and resurrection with Christ, a central theme in Pauline theology (<a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5-6</a>). It parallels the resurrection of Jesus, indicating that believers share in His victory over sin and death. This new life is a gift from God, not earned by human effort, and is a fulfillment of the promise of new life found in the prophets (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>).<p><b>He forgave us all our trespasses</b><br>Forgiveness is a key aspect of the gospel message. The phrase underscores the completeness of God's forgiveness through Christ's atoning sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-17.htm">Hebrews 10:17-18</a>). "All our trespasses" indicates that no sin is too great to be forgiven, reflecting the sufficiency of Christ's work on the cross. This forgiveness restores the broken relationship between humanity and God, fulfilling the prophecy of a new covenant where God remembers sins no more (<a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_colossians.htm">The Colossians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Colossians were members of the early Christian church in Colossae, a city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to the passage, Christ is the one through whom believers are made alive, signifying His role in salvation and forgiveness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The initiator of salvation, God is the one who makes believers alive with Christ and forgives their trespasses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/trespasses_and_uncircumcision.htm">Trespasses and Uncircumcision</a></b><br>These terms refer to the spiritual state of the Colossians before coming to faith in Christ, highlighting their separation from God due to sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_death_and_life.htm">Spiritual Death and Life</a></b><br>Before accepting Christ, we are spiritually dead due to our sins.

Once lifeless and hopeless, we have been resurrected and reconciled solely by God&#8217;s gracious action. Everything we were lacking&#8212;life, acceptance, cleansing&#8212;has been supplied in Jesus, leaving us free to walk in gratitude and confidence before Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And you . . .</span>--Here, exactly as in <a href="/context/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1-18</a>, there is a remarkable intermixture of the word "we" and the word "you," the former conveying the universal statement of the gospel message of mercy, the other applying it emphatically to the Gentiles, as Gentiles. The two passages should be read side by side. There is, as always, strong similarity, yet complete independence. Through the passage of the Ephesian Epistle there runs a two-fold idea, the reconcilement of Jew and Gentile to God, and the union of both in one Catholic Church. In this Epistle it is only on the reconcilement to God in Christ that stress is laid. Even the detailed expressions of the two passages illustrate each other at once by likeness and by variety.<p><span class= "bld">Dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh.</span>--See <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>, "You who were dead in trespasses and sins . . . who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision in the flesh." Here the "deadness" is spoken of, as coming both from the actual power of "sins" (<span class= "ital">transgressions</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and from the alienation from God marked by uncircumcision. In the other passage the uncircumcision is looked upon only as a name of reproach.<p><span class= "bld">Hath he quickened.</span>--It is difficult to determine what is the subject in this sentence. According to all analogy it should be "God," yet in the latter clauses (as in <a href="/context/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14-15</a>) it must surely be "Christ." Now, when we turn to the fuller parallel passage, we see an overt change of subject. It is said (<a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>), "God quickened us together with Christ"; "God in Christ forgave us" (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>); but "Christ abolished the Law," "reconciled us to God on the cross." This suggests a similar change of subject here also, which must be at the words "and took it away," or (for the tense here is changed) "and He (Christ) hath taken it away." This, speaking grammatically, introduces an anomaly; but such anomalies are not uncommon in St. Paul, especially in passages of high spiritual teaching. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And you, being dead by reason of</span> (or, in) <span class="cmt_word">your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses</span> (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-21</a>; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9-13, 24</a>; <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1, 2, 6, 10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>; <a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>). (For the transition from "having raised" (ver. 12) to this verse, comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20 - 2:1</a>; also <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>.) Again the participle gives place to the finite verb: a colon is a sufficient stop at the end of ver. 12. <span class="accented">Death</span>, in St. Paul's theology, is "a collective expression for the entire judicial consequences of sin" (see Cromer's ' Lexicon,' on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b6;&#x3c2;</span>), of which the primary spiritual element is the sundering of the soul's fellowship with God, from which flew all other evils contained, in it. <span class="accented">Life</span>, therefore, begins with <span class="accented">justification</span>, (<a href="/romans/5-18.htm">Romans 5:18</a>). "Trespasses" are particular acts of sin (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1, 5</a>; <a href="/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-20</a>; <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>); "uncircumcision of the flesh" is general sinful impurity of nature. The false teachers probably stigmatized the uncircumcised state as unholy. The apostle adopts the expression, but refers it to the pre-Christian life of his readers (see vers. 11, 12), when their Gentile uncircumcision was a true type of their moral condition (<a href="/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>). These sinful acts and this sinful condition were the cause of their former state of <span class="accented">death</span> (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The Revisers rightly restore the second emphatic "you" - "you, uncircumcised Gentiles" (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21, 22, 27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-18</a>; <a href="/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>). It is <span class="accented">God</span> who "made you alive" as he "raised him (Christ)," (ver. 12); the second act being the consequence and counterpart of the first, <span class="accented">and faith</span> the subjective link between them. <span class="greek">&#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">to show grace</span>, used of Divine forgiveness only in this and the Ephesian Epistle (<a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>: comp. <a href="/luke/7-42.htm">Luke 7:42, 43</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7, 10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-13.htm">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>), points to the cause or principle of forgiveness in the Divine <span class="accented">grace</span> (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>; <a href="/romans/5-17.htm">Romans 5:17</a>). In "having forgiven us" the writer significantly passes from the second to the first person: so in <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a> (comp. <a href="/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9, 30</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>). The thought of the new life bestowed on the Colossians with himself in their individual forgiveness calls to his mind the great act of Divine mercy from which it sprang (the connection corresponds, in reverse order, to that of <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19, 20</a>), and he continues - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
