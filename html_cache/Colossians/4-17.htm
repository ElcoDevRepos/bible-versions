Faithful completion glorifies God, strengthens the body, and secures an eternal reward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Say to Archippus.</span>--Archippus is included in the salutation of the Epistle to Philemon (<a href="/philemon/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,">Philemon 1:1</a>) apparently as a member of his family, and is generally thought to have been his son. He held a "ministry in the Church. The word is the same as the word "diaconate," but it is obviously used in a more general sense, precisely as in the charge to Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>), "Make full proof of thy ministry; "and the whole tone of the passage here suggests that, like Timothy's, it was a ministry of some prominence in the Church. Tradition makes him afterwards a bishop of Laodicea; it is likely enough that he had that leadership among the presbyters, from which the episcopate was developed at the close of the Apostolic period. Whether this was at Colossae--his father's native place--or Laodicea, cannot be gathered with any certainty from the context. The exhortation comes in close connection with Laodicea; yet, on the other hand, it seems strange to send through one church a message to a chief pastor of another. In any case this indirect transmission of a charge is curious, standing in marked contrast with the direct personal addresses of the Philippian Epistle (<a href="/context/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2-3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which thou hast received in the Lord.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">which thou dost receive.</span> The probability seems to be that he received it from St. Paul, or perhaps Epaphras. The phrase is "in the Lord," not "from the Lord." Contrast <a href="/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>, "I received it not from man, neither was I taught but by revelation of Jesus Christ."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou receivedst in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">Lord, that thou fulfil it</span> (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18, 19</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6, 11-16</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13, 14, 20, 21</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>). From the connection of this verse with the two preceding, it seems likely that "the ministry" of Archippus related to the Laodicean Church. Hence he is not addressed directly. If he was, as we gather from <a href="/philemon/1.htm">Philemon 1, 2</a>, the son of Philemon, whose house formed a centre for the Colossian Church (<a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>), the warning would be suitably conveyed through this channel. In the letter to Philemon, the apostle calls him his" fellow soldier" (comp. <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29, 30</a>). Both from this fact, and from the emphasis of the words before us, it would appear that his office was an important one, probably that of chief pastor. This warning addressed so early to the minister of the Laodicean Church is premonitory of the lapsed condition in which it is afterwards found (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>); see Lightfoot, pp. 42, 43.
