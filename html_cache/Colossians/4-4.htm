This reflects the communal nature of the early church, where believers supported one another through prayer. The apostle's request highlights the need for clarity in communicating the gospel, a theme consistent throughout his letters (<a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19-20</a>). The Greek word for "declare" suggests making something known or manifest, indicating Paul's desire for the message of Christ to be understood without confusion. This aligns with the broader biblical mandate for believers to be ready to give an answer for their hope (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>).<p><b>as I should</b><br>Paul acknowledges a divine obligation to preach the gospel, reflecting his calling as an apostle (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>). This phrase underscores the responsibility of all believers to share their faith, but especially those in leadership. The phrase "as I should" implies a standard or expectation set by God, reminding readers of the seriousness of the task. Paul's sense of duty is rooted in his encounter with Christ and his commission to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). This also connects to the prophetic role of declaring God's truth, seen throughout the Old Testament in figures like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who were called to speak God's word to the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter to the Colossians, writing from prison.
