The Apostle Paul emphasizes that the proclamation is not about human wisdom or philosophy but about Jesus Christ Himself. This aligns with Paul's other writings, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>, where he states his determination to know nothing except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. The proclamation of Christ is the core mission of the Church, reflecting the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<p><b>Admonishing and teaching everyone</b><br>Admonishing involves warning and correcting, while teaching involves instructing and educating. This dual approach is essential for spiritual growth and maturity. The use of "everyone" underscores the universal nature of the Gospel, transcending cultural, social, and ethnic boundaries. This is consistent with the inclusive message seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul declares that there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus.<p><b>With all wisdom</b><br>Wisdom here refers to the divine insight and understanding that comes from God, as opposed to human wisdom. This echoes <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, which encourages believers to ask God for wisdom. The wisdom Paul speaks of is necessary for effectively admonishing and teaching, ensuring that the message is communicated in a way that is both truthful and loving. This wisdom is a gift of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>.<p><b>So that we may present everyone perfect in Christ</b><br>The goal of Paul's ministry is to present believers as mature and complete in Christ. The term "perfect" here implies spiritual maturity and completeness, not sinless perfection. This is a process of sanctification, as described in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, where God, who began a good work in believers, will carry it on to completion. The ultimate aim is to be conformed to the image of Christ, as stated in <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>. This presentation is eschatological, looking forward to the day when believers will stand before Christ fully mature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, Paul is writing to the church in Colossae to address false teachings and to affirm the supremacy of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

St. Paul, in opposition to the exclusive claim of "perfection" by the speculators in mystic knowledge ("falsely so called") would present "every man," learned or ignorant, "perfect before God." In this universality of privilege lies the glorious distinction between the gospel and all schools of philosophy, whether they reject or assume its name. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom we proclaim, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom</span> (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4-13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23, 24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-11.htm">1 Corinthians 15:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1-6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-6:1</a>; <a href="/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18-35</a>; <a href="/acts/26-22.htm">Acts 26:22, 23</a>). <span class="accented">We</span> (emphatic, like the "I" of vers. 23, 25) includes St. Paul's coadjutors, Epaphras in particular (ver. 9; <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7, 11, 12</a>: comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">to publish</span>, bears a wider sense than <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">to herald</span> (ver. 23), St. Paul's favourite word.

In <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a> the apostle denounces the pride of reason which claims "the things of God" as its own; here he denounces the pride of intellect which refuses the knowledge of them to those who stand on a lower level of mental culture. To <span class="accented">every man</span> the Divine wisdom in Christ is accessible (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3, 10</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10, 16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18, 19</a>): to none but "the spiritual man" (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 12-3:1</a>). "Wisdom" here is not subjective, a quality of the apostle (so Meyer, quoting <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>), but objective, the quality of the truth itself (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 23</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22-25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we may present every man perfect in Christ</span> (ver. 22; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-7.htm">2 Corinthians 13:7-9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>): the aim alike of Christ's redemption (ver. 22) and of the apostle's ministry. "Perfect" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is a word associated with the Greek mysteries (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>; and quotations in Lightfoot), and in common use denoted "full-grown," "grown men," as opposed to" children "(<a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12, 15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11-6:1</a>). The philosophic Judaists affected this term considerably. Philo frequently distinguishes between the "perfect" or "fully initiated" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), who are admitted to the sight of God, and the "advancing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>), who are candidates for admission to the Divine mysteries; and he makes Jacob a type of the latter, Israel of the former (see 'On Drunkenness,' &sect; 20; 'On Change of Names,' &sect; 3; 'On Agriculture,' &sect;&sect; 36-38). The apostle makes "perfect" designedly parallel to the "holy and without blemish" of ver. 22, holding out a spiritual ideal very different from that of Alexandrine mystics; and declares that it is to be realized "in Christ" (vers. 2, 4), as in ver. 22 it appeared to be wrought "through Christ" and "for Christ" (comp. ver. 16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;meis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
