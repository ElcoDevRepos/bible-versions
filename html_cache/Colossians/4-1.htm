The term "masters" here refers to those in positions of authority, particularly in a household or business context. This reflects the social structure of the time, where slavery was a common institution. The Bible addresses masters directly, indicating their responsibility and accountability before God.<p><b>supply your slaves with what is right and fair,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the ethical treatment of slaves, which was countercultural in a society where slaves had few rights. The call to provide what is "right and fair" suggests a standard of justice and equity that transcends cultural norms. This aligns with the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and treating others as one would want to be treated (<a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>). It also reflects the Old Testament laws that called for fair treatment of servants (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>).<p><b>since you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</b><br>This phrase reminds masters of their own accountability to God, who is the ultimate authority. It underscores the Christian belief that all people, regardless of social status, are equal before God and will be judged by Him (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6-11</a>). This serves as a humbling reminder that earthly authority is temporary and subject to divine oversight. The concept of God as a Master also points to the servanthood of Christ, who, though Lord of all, came to serve and give His life as a ransom for many (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/masters.htm">Masters</a></b><br>In the context of the Roman Empire, masters were those who owned slaves and had authority over them.
