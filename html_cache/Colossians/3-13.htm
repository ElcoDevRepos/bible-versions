In the context of the early church, believers came from diverse backgrounds, including Jews and Gentiles, which often led to cultural and religious tensions. Bearing with one another involves enduring these differences and maintaining unity. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>, where Paul urges believers to be humble, gentle, and patient, bearing with one another in love. The call to bear with one another reflects the character of Christ, who showed patience and compassion throughout His ministry.<p><b>and forgive any complaint you may have against someone else.</b><br>Forgiveness is a central theme in Christian teaching, rooted in the example of Jesus Christ. In the historical context of Colossians, the early church faced internal conflicts and grievances. Paul instructs believers to forgive grievances, which aligns with Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14-15</a>), where He emphasizes the necessity of forgiving others to receive God's forgiveness. This directive also reflects the Jewish understanding of forgiveness, which involves releasing others from debts or wrongs, as seen in the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25). Forgiveness is not merely a personal act but a communal one, essential for maintaining harmony within the body of Christ.<p><b>Forgive as the Lord forgave you.</b><br>This phrase sets the standard for forgiveness, pointing to the ultimate example of Christ's forgiveness. Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross is the foundation for Christian forgiveness, as He bore the sins of humanity and offered reconciliation with God (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The call to forgive as the Lord forgave underscores the depth and breadth of divine forgiveness, which is unconditional and complete. This mirrors the parable of the unmerciful servant in <a href="/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21-35</a>, where Jesus teaches that those who have been forgiven much should also forgive others. The phrase challenges believers to emulate Christ's grace and mercy, fostering a community that reflects God's love and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, Paul was writing to the church in Colossae to address various theological and practical issues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) where the church was located.

The words, "if any have any complaint," etc., would certainly apply to Philemon as against Onesimus (<a href="/philemon/1-18.htm">Philemon 1:18, 19</a>: comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-5.htm">2 Corinthians 2:5-11</a>; <a href="/mark/11-25.htm">Mark 11:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even as the Lord</span> (or, <span class="accented">Christ</span>) <span class="cmt_word">forgave you, so also ye</span> (<a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38</a>; <a href="/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-8</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-27.htm">Matthew 18:27</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>). This argument is latent in the appeal to the "elect" and "beloved" of ver. 12. The evidence for the alternative readings, "Lord" and "Christ," is nearly equal in weight. In any case, the "Lord" is "Christ" in this passage (<a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17, 24</a>): and that <span class="accented">he</span> forgave (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, note) is quite consistent with the assertion that <span class="accented">God</span> forgave (<a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>), for God forgave "in Christ" (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>). So "God in Christ reconciled" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>); and yet "Christ reconciled us" (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>). "Forgiving," supplied in thought from previous context, completes the sense of "so also ye" (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott). To suppose an ellipsis of the imperative, with Light foot and the English Version ("do ye"), is needlessly to break the structure of the sentence. Ver. 14 shows that the leading imperative, "put on," of ver. 12 is still in the writer's mind. For the reciprocal double <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> ("even.., also"), comp. <a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a> or <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; it is characteristic of the writer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/3-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Bear with</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#949;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(anechomenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">To endure, bear with, have patience with, suffer, admit, persist. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">each other</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#942;&#955;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#275;l&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Reciprocal Pronoun - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_240.htm">Strong's 240: </a> </span><span class="str2">One another, each other.
