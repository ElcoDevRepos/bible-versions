In the biblical context, wrongdoing is not limited to specific groups but applies to all individuals. The concept of wrongdoing is rooted in the Old Testament law, where sin is defined as transgression against God's commandments (<a href="/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>). The New Testament continues this theme, highlighting that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p><b>will be repaid for his wrong</b><br>This reflects the principle of divine justice, where actions have consequences. The idea of retribution is consistent with the biblical teaching that God is just and will judge each person according to their deeds (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>). This phrase also echoes the Old Testament principle of "an eye for an eye" (<a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>), though in the New Testament, the focus is on God's ultimate judgment rather than human retribution.<p><b>and there is no favoritism</b><br>This statement underscores the impartiality of God's judgment. In the cultural context of the early church, favoritism was a significant issue, as seen in the divisions between Jews and Gentiles. The New Testament repeatedly affirms that God shows no partiality (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>, <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>), emphasizing that all are equal before Him.

"For" is replaced by "but" in the same inferior copies which insert it in the last sentence. Here we have the ether side of the recompense promised in ver. 24 <span class="accented">a</span>, to which the explanatory "for" points back. The impartial justice which avenges every wrong guarantees the reward of the faithful servant of Christ. So the Old Testament saints rightly argued (<a href="/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9-11</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10, 11</a>; <a href="/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7-10</a>) that the punishment of the evil doer affords hope to the righteous man.

"Equity is the mother of Justice" (Philo, 'On the Creation of Magistrates,' &sect; 14; see other illustrations in Lightfoot). Meyer contends for the stricter sense, "equality" (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-13.htm">2 Corinthians 8:13, 14</a>) - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Church status and brotherhood (<a href="/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). But the context suggests no such special reference; it deals with the family and social relationship of master and servant "Equity" is a well-established sense of the Greek word. The law of equity bearing on all human relations Christ has laid down in <a href="/luke/6-31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>. Here is the germinal principle of the abolition of slavery. Moral equity, as realized by the Christian consciousness, was sure in course of time to bring about legal equality. Knowing that ye also have a Lord in heaven (<a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>; <a href="/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). (On "knowing," see ver. 24 a.) "Ye also," for Christ is "both their Lord and yours" (<a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>, Revised Text).

The assertion that the proud master who deemed his fellow man his chattel is himself a mere <span class="accented">slave</span> of Christ, sets Christ's authority in a vivid and striking light.
