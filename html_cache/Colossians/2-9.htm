The Apostle Paul is addressing the Colossian church, which was facing false teachings that diminished the supremacy of Christ. By stating "in Christ," Paul affirms that all spiritual truths and realities are found in Him. This echoes <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, highlighting the incarnation of Christ as the foundation of Christian belief.<p><b>all the fullness</b><br>The term "fullness" (Greek: pleroma) signifies completeness and totality. In the context of Colossians, it counters the Gnostic idea that divine knowledge or spiritual fullness could be attained through other means or intermediaries. Paul asserts that everything necessary for salvation and spiritual life is found in Christ alone. This concept is also reflected in <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>, where the church is described as the body of Christ, the fullness of Him who fills everything in every way.<p><b>of the Deity</b><br>The word "Deity" (Greek: theot&#275;s) refers to the divine nature or essence. This phrase underscores the belief in the full divinity of Christ, affirming that He is not merely a reflection or part of God but fully God Himself. This is consistent with the doctrine of the Trinity, where Jesus is co-equal and co-eternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit. This aligns with <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, where Jesus declares, "I and the Father are one."<p><b>dwells</b><br>The verb "dwells" (Greek: katoikei) indicates a permanent residence, not a temporary or partial presence. This suggests that the divine nature of Christ is not something He occasionally possesses but is an integral and eternal aspect of His being. This is in contrast to the Old Testament tabernacle or temple, where God's presence was manifested temporarily. In Christ, the fullness of God permanently resides, as seen in <a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>, where Jesus says, "Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father."<p><b>in bodily form</b><br>This phrase affirms the incarnation, the belief that God became flesh in the person of Jesus Christ. It counters early heresies like Docetism, which denied the true humanity of Christ. By emphasizing "bodily form," Paul highlights that Jesus was fully human while being fully divine, capable of experiencing human life and suffering. This is crucial for the understanding of the atonement, as only a fully human and fully divine Savior could reconcile humanity to God. This is supported by <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>, where Christ is described as taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, believed to be the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.

Instead of looking elsewhere for truth, he points them straight to Jesus: &#8220;He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17-18</a>). Everything God wants us to know and experience centers on Christ. John records Jesus saying, &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>). The emphasis is simple: keep your focus on the Person who is both the source and goal of all spiritual life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the fullness</b><p>Nothing of God is missing in Jesus. &#8220;God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>). From that completeness &#8220;we have all received grace upon grace&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>). Jesus is not a partial revelation or one of many ways; He embodies the totality of God&#8217;s wisdom, power, love, and grace. That means believers never need to seek a supplement to Christ&#8212;He is entirely sufficient.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the Deity</b><p>The verse makes an unambiguous claim: Jesus is fully God. John starts his Gospel with the same truth&#8212;&#8220;the Word was God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>). The writer of Hebrews agrees: Jesus is &#8220;the radiance of God&#8217;s glory and the exact representation of His nature&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). Paul echoes this in <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, calling Jesus &#8220;our great God and Savior.&#8221; To confess Christ is to acknowledge His complete equality with the Father (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>dwells</b><p>&#8220;Dwells&#8221; is present and continuous. The Godhead does not merely visit Jesus; it permanently resides in Him. Jesus told Philip, &#8220;The Father dwelling in Me performs His works&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>). This ongoing indwelling guarantees that the Savior we trust today is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Because He remains fully God, &#8220;you have been made complete in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>); His sufficiency never expires.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in bodily form</b><p>Here lies the mystery and wonder of the incarnation: &#8220;The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). God the Son took on a real human body, kept it through death, and rose in it&#8212;&#8220;Touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>). <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a> highlights His humility in doing so, while <a href="/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2</a> insists that confessing Christ&#8217;s genuine humanity is essential. Jesus remains eternally both God and man, the perfect mediator who represents us before the Father.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a> declares that everything God is resides permanently and completely in Jesus Christ, who came&#8212;and still exists&#8212;in a real human body. Because the full deity lives in Him, He is the final, sufficient, and exclusive source of truth, salvation, and spiritual fullness for every believer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</span>--Here almost every word is emphatic. First, "All the fulness of the Godhead"--not a mere emanation from the Supreme Being. Next, "dwells" and remains for ever--not descending on Him for a time and leaving Him again. Lastly, "bodily," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as incarnate in His humanity. The whole is an extension and enforcement of <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>, "God was pleased that in Him all the fulness should dwell." The horror of all that was material, as having in it the seed of evil, induced denial either of the reality of our Lord's body, or of its inseparable connection with the Godhead in Him. Hence the emphasis here; as also we find (somewhat later) in St. John, "The Word was made flesh" (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>); "The spirit which confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . . . is the spirit of antichrist" (<a href="/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1John 4:3</a>).<p>On the meaning of "fullness" (<span class= "ital">plerorna</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>see <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm" title=" That you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;">Colossians 1:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>. Here it is only necessary to add, that, as in the later Gnosticism, so probably in its earlier forms, the word was used for the infinite nature of the Supreme Deity, out of which all the emanations (afterwards called <span class= "ital">'ons</span>) received in various degrees of imperfection, according to their capacity. Probably for that reason St. Paul uses it so emphatically here. In the same spirit, St. John declares (<a href="/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a>), <span class= "ital">"</span>Out of His (Christ's) fulness have all we received." It is not finite, but infinitely perfect; hence we all can draw from it, yet leave it unimpaired. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because in him dwelleth all the fulness</span> (or, <span class="accented">completeness</span>) of the Godhead bodily (<a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>; <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3, 4</a>; <a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 14</a>). In <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18-20</a> we viewed a series of events; here we have an abiding fact. The whole plenitude of our Lord's Divine-human person and powers, as the complete Christ, was definitively constituted when, in the exercise of his kingly prerogative, "he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high." "From henceforth" that fulness evermore <span class="accented">resides in him</span> (comp. note, <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>). The undivided <span class="accented">pleroma</span> of <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a> now reveals its twofold nature: it is "the fulness of the Godhead," and yet "dwells corporeally in him." "Godhead" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) is the abstract of "God" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), not of the adjective "Divine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate therefore, wrongly, <span class="accented">divinitatis:</span> comp. <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>; <a href="/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>; Wisd. 18:9), and denotes,"not Divine excellences, but the Divine nature" (Bengel); see Trench's 'Synonyms.' Schenkel and others, guided by a conjecture of Theodoret, have found here the <span class="accented">Church</span>, supporting their view by a very doubtful interpretation of <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. Still more groundless is the identification of this <span class="accented">pleroma</span> with <span class="accented">the created world.</span> The apostle unmistakably affirms that the Divine nature, in its entirety, belongs to the Church's Christ. The literal sense of "bodily" (maintained by Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Hofmann, after Chrysostom and Athanasius) has been avoided by those who render it "wholly" (Jerome); "essentially, substantially" (Cyril, Theophylact, Calvin, Klopper), as opposed to "relatively" or "partially;" "truly" (Augustine, Erasmus, Bengel, Bleek), as opposed to "figuretively" (ver. 17). The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (always <span class="accented">literal</span> in classical usage, along with its adjective) occurs only here in the New Testament; the adjective "bodily" in <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>. "The body of his flesh" in <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a> affords a truer parallel than the language of ver. 17, where <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, bears an exceptional sense (see note). Elsewhere St. Paul balances in similar fashion expressions relating to the twofold nature of Christ (see parallels). The assertion that "all the fulness of Deity" dwells in Christ negatives the Alexandrine "philosophy," with its cloud of mediating angel powers and spiritual emanations; the assertion that it dwells in him <span class="accented">bodily</span> equally condemns that contempt for the body and the material world which was the chief practical tenet of the same school (comp. notes on Colossians 1:22 and Colossians 2:23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
