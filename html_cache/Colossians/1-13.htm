The "dominion of darkness" refers to the realm of sin and Satan's influence over humanity. Biblically, darkness often symbolizes ignorance, evil, and separation from God (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The rescue implies a divine intervention, akin to the Exodus where God delivered Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). This deliverance is not by human effort but by God's power, highlighting His sovereignty and grace.<p><b>and brought us into the kingdom of His beloved Son</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the transfer from one realm to another, signifying a change in status and allegiance. The "kingdom of His beloved Son" refers to the reign of Jesus Christ, characterized by righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>). This kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope, as believers live under Christ's lordship now and anticipate His return. The term "beloved Son" echoes God's declaration at Jesus' baptism and transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17, 17</a>:5), affirming His divine sonship and the Father's pleasure in Him. This transfer is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's eternal kingdom (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who initiates the rescue from darkness and transfers believers into the kingdom of His Son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ (His beloved Son)</a></b><br>The Son into whose kingdom believers are brought, signifying His authority and love.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dominion_of_darkness.htm">Dominion of Darkness</a></b><br>Represents the realm of sin, evil, and separation from God, from which believers are rescued.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom_of_his_beloved_son.htm">Kingdom of His Beloved Son</a></b><br>The realm of Christ's rule, characterized by light, righteousness, and fellowship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of the letter, the Colossians, lived.

To "translate" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>) is to remove from one place, office, etc., to another; Josephus ('Ant.,' 9:11, 1) uses it of the deportation of the Israelites by the Assyrian king. <span class="accented">The Father</span>, rescuing his captive children, brings them "into the kingdom of the Son of his love." Here we touch the central and governing idea of this Epistle, that of <span class="accented">the supreme lordship of Christ</span> (vers. 15-20; <a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6, 10, 19</a>, etc.); and this passage affords a clue which will, we trust, guide us through some of the greatest difficulties which follow.
