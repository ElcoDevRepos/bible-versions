The "them" likely refers to the Gentile community and its practices, which were often characterized by idolatry and immorality. In the broader context of Colossians, Paul is addressing a predominantly Gentile audience who had been living according to the cultural norms of the Greco-Roman world. This world was marked by polytheism and a variety of moral and ethical standards that were contrary to the teachings of Christ. The phrase emphasizes the transformation that occurs when one becomes a follower of Jesus, leaving behind the old ways of life.<p><b>you also used to walk</b><br>The term "walk" is often used in Scripture to describe one's way of life or conduct. In <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, Paul similarly describes the former way of life as walking according to the course of this world. This metaphor of walking suggests a habitual lifestyle, indicating that the behaviors and attitudes were not occasional but rather a consistent pattern. The use of "used to" highlights the change that has taken place in the believers' lives, underscoring the theme of transformation and renewal found throughout the New Testament. This transformation is a key aspect of Christian conversion, where believers are called to walk in newness of life (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>).<p><b>in these ways</b><br>The "ways" refer to the sinful behaviors and practices that were common in the lives of the Colossians before their conversion. In the preceding verses, Paul lists specific sins such as sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which he equates with idolatry. These behaviors were prevalent in the pagan culture of the time and were often associated with the worship of various deities. The call to abandon these ways is a call to holiness and a reflection of the new identity in Christ. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's people being set apart and called to live according to His statutes, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossian_church.htm">Colossian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Colossian church was a Christian community in the ancient city of Colossae, located in modern-day Turkey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Phrygia, Asia Minor, known for its diverse population and religious practices, which included paganism and early Gnostic influences.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Many members of the Colossian church were Gentile converts who had previously lived according to pagan customs and practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sinful_ways.htm">Sinful Ways</a></b><br>Refers to the behaviors and lifestyles that are contrary to Christian teachings, which the Colossians were called to leave behind.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_in_christ.htm">Transformation in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to leave behind our old ways and embrace a new life in Christ.

The latter interpretation is against the general usage of "walk in" with St. Paul (<a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2, 10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>), and seems to condemn the mere fact of living "amongst the sons of disobedience" (see, on the other hand, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9, 10</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>; <a href="/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>). The parallel "because of which" (ver. 6) gives <span class="accented">also</span> its force: these sins are visited with the Divine anger, and <span class="accented">moreover</span> are the very sins in which the Colossians aforetime had lived; observe the same connection in <a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6-8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-10.htm">1 Corinthians 6:10, 11</a>.
