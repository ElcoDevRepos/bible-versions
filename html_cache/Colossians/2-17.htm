In the context of Colossians, Paul addresses the Colossian church, which was being influenced by false teachings that emphasized adherence to these Jewish customs. The term "shadow" suggests that these practices were not the ultimate reality but rather a foreshadowing of something greater. This concept is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>, where the law is described as a shadow of the good things to come, not the realities themselves. The "things to come" point to the fulfillment of these shadows in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who embodies the substance and reality of what the Old Testament anticipated.<p><b>but the body that casts it belongs to Christ</b><br>The "body" here signifies the substance or reality, contrasting with the "shadow." In this context, the body is Christ Himself, who fulfills the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The imagery of a shadow and body illustrates that while the Old Testament laws were important, they were not the end goal; rather, they pointed to Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where Christ is seen as the culmination of God's promises, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh. The phrase underscores the sufficiency of Christ, emphasizing that believers are complete in Him (<a href="/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>), and do not need to adhere to the old ceremonial laws to achieve righteousness. This teaching was crucial for the early church, which was navigating the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant established through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, addressing the church in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Phrygia, Asia Minor, where the early Christian church was established.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose life and teachings are the foundation of the faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_traditions.htm">Jewish Traditions</a></b><br>The context of the "shadow" refers to Jewish laws and customs, such as dietary laws and festivals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The body of believers in Christ, who are the recipients of Paul's teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_shadow.htm">Understanding the Shadow</a></b><br>The Old Testament laws and rituals were a shadow, a foreshadowing of the reality found in Christ.

"The Law had a shadow of good things to come, not the very image (or, <span class= "ital">substance</span>) of the things" (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>). When St. Paul deals with the legal and coercive aspect of the Law, he calls it "the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ." (See <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24</a>, and Note there.) When he turns to its ritual aspect, he describes it as simply foreshadowing or typifying the substance; and therefore useful before the revelation of the substance, useless or (if trusted in) worse than useless, after it. In every way "Christ is the end of the Law" (<a href="/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ</span> (<a href="/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23-25</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-11.htm">2 Corinthians 3:11, 13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18, 19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>). The apostle's opponents, we imagine, taught in Platonic fashion that these things were shadows of <span class="accented">ideal truth</span> and of <span class="accented">the invisible world</span> (comp. <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>), forms necessary to our apprehension of spiritual things. With St. Paul, they shadow forth prophetically <span class="accented">the concrete facts of the Christian revelation</span>, and therefore are displaced by its advent. The singular verb (literally, <span class="accented">is</span>) quite grammatically combines the particulars of ver. 16 under their common idea of a foreshadowing of the things of Christ; and the present tense affirms here a general truth, not a mere historical fact. How this was true of the "sabbath," e.g., appears in <a href="/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>; comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>; <a href="/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>, for the Christian import of the Passover feast. The figurative antithesis of "shadow" and "body" is sufficiently obvious; it occurs in Philo and in Josephus: to refer to ver. 19 and <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a> for the sense of <span class="accented">body</span>, is misleading. For "the things to come" (the things of Christ and of the new, Christian era, now commencing), comp. <a href="/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24</a>; <a href="/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>. This substance of the new, abiding revelation (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-11.htm">2 Corinthians 3:11</a>) is "Christ's," inasmuch as it centres in and is pervaded and governed by Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a>). Nothing is said here to discountenance positive Christian institutions, or the observance of the Lord's day in particular, unless enforced in a Judaistic spirit. The apostle is protecting Gentile Christians from the re-imposition of Jewish institutions as such, as impairing their faith in Christ (comp. <a href="/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-9</a>), and as, in the case of the Colossians, involving a deference to the authority of angels which limited his sovereignty and sufficiency (vers. 8-10, 18, 19). This verse contains in germ much of the thought of the Epistle to the Hebrews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7941;</span> <span class="translit">(ha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">are</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
