The knowledge referred to here is not just intellectual but experiential, rooted in the teachings of Christ and the apostles. This assurance is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/5-13.htm">John 5:13</a>, where believers are encouraged to know they have eternal life.<p><b>that you will receive</b><br>The future tense indicates a promise yet to be fulfilled, pointing to the eschatological hope of Christians. This promise is a central tenet of Christian doctrine, reflecting the belief in future rewards for faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>, where the faithful servant is promised joy and reward.<p><b>an inheritance</b><br>In the cultural and historical context of the first century, inheritance was a significant concept, often associated with land and family legacy. Biblically, it connects to the Old Testament promises to Israel, such as the land of Canaan. In the New Testament, this inheritance is spiritual, referring to eternal life and the kingdom of God, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>.<p><b>from the Lord</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine source of the inheritance, contrasting earthly inheritances that come from human parents. The Lord here refers to God, emphasizing His sovereignty and the divine nature of the promise. This aligns with <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, which speaks of every good and perfect gift coming from above.<p><b>as your reward</b><br>The concept of reward is tied to the idea of divine justice and recompense for faithfulness. In the Greco-Roman world, rewards were often given for loyalty and service, a concept that Paul adapts to describe the spiritual rewards for believers. This is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him.<p><b>It is the Lord Christ you are serving.</b><br>This phrase highlights the centrality of Christ in the believer's life and service. It serves as a reminder that all Christian service is ultimately directed towards Christ, not merely human masters. This aligns with the teaching in <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>, where serving others is equated with serving Christ Himself. The use of "Lord Christ" emphasizes His authority and divinity, reinforcing the call to serve Him with reverence and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, writing to encourage and instruct the believers in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the recipients of the letter resided.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_colossian_church.htm">The Colossian Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in Colossae, facing challenges from false teachings and needing guidance on living a Christ-centered life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_christ.htm">The Lord Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message of Colossians, emphasizing the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ in all things.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>A key concept in this verse, referring to the eternal reward promised to believers, rooted in the Jewish understanding of inheritance as a divine promise.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_inheritance.htm">Understanding Our Inheritance</a></b><br>Recognize that our ultimate reward is not earthly but eternal, promised by God through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/serving_christ_in_all_things.htm">Serving Christ in All Things</a></b><br>Every task, no matter how mundane, is an opportunity to serve Christ.

The opposite truth is asserted in ver. 25; <a href="/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a> combines them both.
