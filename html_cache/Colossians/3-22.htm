This directive reflects the social structure of the time, where slaves were expected to serve their masters. The call for obedience is consistent with other New Testament teachings, such as <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>, which also address the conduct of slaves. The emphasis on obedience "in everything" suggests a comprehensive submission, aligning with the broader biblical principle of respecting authority (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of order and discipline within the Christian community, even in difficult circumstances.<p><b>not only to please them while they are watching</b><br>This phrase highlights the temptation to perform duties only when under supervision, a common human tendency. The instruction here is to avoid mere eye-service, which is also mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>. The deeper principle is integrity, doing what is right regardless of who is watching. This reflects the biblical call to sincerity and truthfulness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>, which speaks of the integrity of the upright guiding them. The focus is on internal motivation rather than external appearances.<p><b>but with sincerity of heart and fear of the Lord</b><br>"Sincerity of heart" implies a genuine and wholehearted approach to one's duties, contrasting with hypocrisy or pretense. This aligns with the biblical theme of God valuing the heart's intentions over outward actions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>. The "fear of the Lord" is a foundational biblical concept, representing reverence and awe towards God, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is not about terror but about respect and acknowledgment of God's authority and holiness. By serving with sincerity and fear of the Lord, slaves are reminded that their ultimate accountability is to God, not just their earthly masters. This perspective elevates their service to an act of worship, aligning with <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>, which encourages doing everything as if for the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, providing guidance to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossian_church.htm">Colossian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in the city of Colossae in Asia Minor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/slaves.htm">Slaves</a></b><br>Individuals in servitude, addressed directly in this passage, representing a significant portion of the early Christian community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/earthly_masters.htm">Earthly Masters</a></b><br>The human authorities over the slaves, to whom the slaves are instructed to show obedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, whose authority and reverence are the ultimate motivation for the behavior of believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_as_a_testimony_of_faith.htm">Obedience as a Testimony of Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to demonstrate their faith through obedience, reflecting Christ&#8217;s example of submission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sincerity_of_heart.htm">Sincerity of Heart</a></b><br>Actions should be motivated by genuine sincerity and integrity, not merely external compliance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_the_lord.htm">Reverence for the Lord</a></b><br>Our ultimate allegiance is to Christ, and our earthly duties should reflect our reverence for Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/work_as_worship.htm">Work as Worship</a></b><br>Every task, no matter how mundane, can be an act of worship when done for the Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transforming_social_structures.htm">Transforming Social Structures</a></b><br>While the text addresses a specific social structure, the principles of respect and integrity transcend time and culture, encouraging believers to transform their environments through Christ-like behavior.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Colossians_3_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Colossians 3:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Colossians_3_22_s_impact_on_work_ethic.htm">How can Colossians 3:22 guide our work ethic in modern employment settings?

In <a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21-22</a> the Spirit reminds every slave that he is the Lord&#8217;s freedman, even while still under an earthly yoke.

The only peculiarity of this passage is the strong emphasis laid on "the reward of the inheritance." "The reward" is in the original, <span class= "ital">a perfect recompense</span> or <span class= "ital">requital.</span> The "inheritance" is exactly that which no slave could receive; only a son could be an heir (<a href="/galatians/4-7.htm" title="Why you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.">Galatians 4:7</a>).

The attitude of St. Paul and of Christianity towards slavery claims consideration under the Epistle to Philemon; on this point see Lightfoot's 'Introduction.' Here and in <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a> (comp. vers. 7, 8) the apostle calls the master <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("lord") in reference to "the Lord Christ" (vers. 22 b, 24); elsewhere in the New Testament, as in common Greek, the opposite of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>, etc.), "According to flesh," that is, "in outward, earthly relationship" (comp. <a href="/romans/4-1.htm">Romans 4:1</a>): Christ is <span class="accented">the Lord</span> in the absolute and abiding sense of the word (similarly, "in the flesh" and "in the Lord," <a href="/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not with acts of eye service</span> (literally, <span class="accented">not</span> <span class="accented">in eye services</span>)<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> as man pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord</span> (<a href="/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>; <a href="/luke/11-34.htm">Luke 11:34</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5-8</a>; <a href="/psalms/123-2.htm">Psalm 123:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>). "Eye service" is plural here, according to Revised Text; singular in <a href="/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>. Here the word <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> first oocurs in Greek, like <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>). It strikes at the besetting sin of servants of all kinds. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("man pleaser") occurs in the LXX, <a href="/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a> (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). The servant whose aim it is to please his earthly master in what will catch his eye, plays a <span class="accented">double</span> part, acting in one way when observed, in another when left to himself; with this duplicity is contrasted "singleness of heart" (comp. <a href="/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a> and 1 Cor 9:11, 13 has a different application). "Fearing the Lord" more than the eye of his earthly lord, the Christian servant will always act in "singleness of heart;" for "the eyes of the Lord are in every place." In the same manner the apostle ("bondman of Christ Jesus," <a href="/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a>) speaks of his own relations to men and to the Lord Christ respectively (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3-5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4-6</a>, etc.: comp. <a href="/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37-44</a>). The reading "God" of Received Text is a copyist's emendation, a sample of a large class of corruptions of the text, where a word more familiar in any given connection is, more or less unconsciously, substituted for the original word. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Slaves,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(douloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1401.htm">Strong's 1401: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) (as adj.) enslaved, (b) (as noun) a (male) slave.
