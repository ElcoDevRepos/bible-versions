In the context of Colossians, Paul addresses the false teachings infiltrating the church, which emphasized strict adherence to dietary laws and ascetic practices. These practices are rooted in the Old Testament ceremonial laws, which were fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>). The perishability of these regulations highlights their inability to provide lasting spiritual benefit or salvation, contrasting with the eternal nature of Christ's work (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<p><b>because they are based on human commands and teachings</b><br>Paul critiques the human origin of these regulations, distinguishing them from divine commandments. This echoes Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees for elevating human traditions above God's commandments (<a href="/mark/7-7.htm">Mark 7:7-8</a>). The Colossian heresy involved a syncretism of Jewish legalism, Greek philosophy, and mysticism, which detracted from the sufficiency of Christ. The emphasis on human teachings underscores the danger of relying on man-made doctrines rather than the gospel, which is rooted in divine revelation (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>).

But the last word--which signifies, not only "using," but <span class= "ital">"</span>using up"--seems to decide for the latter alternative. The things are things which go to destruction and are used up. What permanent effect can they leave behind? See <a href="/1_corinthians/8-8.htm" title="But meat commends us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.">1Corinthians 8:8</a> (whether the words of St. Paul, or the words of the Corinthians, accepted as true by him), "Meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse." It is but an echo of our Lord's own teaching as to that which goeth into the mouth (<a href="/context/matthew/15-16.htm" title="And Jesus said, Are you also yet without understanding?">Matthew 15:16-17</a>; <a href="/context/mark/13-18.htm" title="And pray you that your flight be not in the winter.">Mark 13:18-19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">After the commandments . . .</span>--See <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>, and Note there.

This is the position which Christ himself takes in regard to Jewish distinctions of meats (<a href="/mark/7-14.htm">Mark 7:14-23</a>, R.V.). We note the same style of sarcastic comment on the language of the false teachers as that exhibited in ver. 18. Augustine, Calvin, and some ethers render, "which (decrees) tend to (spiritual) destruction in their use;" but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> never means simply "use," and the antecedent "decrees" is awkwardly supplied. More plausibly, De Wette and some moderns interpret, "things which tend to (spiritual) destruction in their abuse," putting the words in the mouth of the false teacher, as though he said, "Abstain from everything the use of which may be fatal to the soul." But this ascribes to the errorist an argument which fails short of his principles (see note on "hard treatment of the body," ver. 23); and to which, specious as it is, and in harmony with the apostle's own teaching (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-12.htm">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-26.htm">1 Corinthians 9:26, 27</a>), he makes no reply. <span class="cmt_word">According to the commandments and teachings of men</span> (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, LXX; <a href="/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>; <a href="/mark/7-7.htm">Mark 7:7</a>; ver. 8; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-5.htm">1 Corinthians 2:5, 13</a>); the only passage in this Epistle which distinctly alludes to the language of the Old Testament. But the words are, we may suppose, primarily a reminiscence of the language of Christ, who uses them in connection with his announcement of the abolition of the sacred distinctions of meats (comp. <a href="/mark/7-1.htm">Mark 7:1-23</a>). This clause points out the method after which, and direction in which, the new teachers were leading their disciples, on the line of a man-made instead of a God given religion. "Commandments" (or, "injunctions") include the prescriptions of ver. 21 and all others like them; "teachings" embrace the general principles and doctrines on which these rules were based. So this expression, following "rudiments of the world (ver. 20), leads us back by a rapid generalization from the particulars specified in ver. 21 to the general starting point given in ver. 8 (see note), and prepares us for the brief and energetic summary of the whole Colossian error which we find in - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[These]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7941;</span> <span class="translit">(ha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">will</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
