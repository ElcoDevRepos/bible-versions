The imagery of being "rooted" suggests a deep, stable connection, much like a tree that draws nourishment from the soil. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the righteous are likened to a tree planted by streams of water. The idea of being "built up" suggests growth and development, akin to constructing a building on a solid foundation. In <a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>, Paul states that no other foundation can be laid than that which is Jesus Christ. This dual imagery of agriculture and architecture underscores the necessity of both stability and growth in the Christian life, rooted in the teachings and person of Jesus.<p><b>Established in the faith as you were taught</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of being grounded in the teachings of the faith. The term "established" implies a firm, unwavering commitment, suggesting that believers should be steadfast in their beliefs. This is reminiscent of <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>, where Paul warns against being tossed by waves and carried by every wind of doctrine. The phrase "as you were taught" points to the tradition of apostolic teaching, which was crucial in the early church. The Colossians were likely taught by Epaphras, a fellow servant of Paul (<a href="/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>). This teaching was rooted in the gospel message, which was consistent with the teachings of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<p><b>And overflowing with thankfulness</b><br>This phrase calls for an attitude of gratitude, which is a recurring theme in Paul's letters. Thankfulness is not just an emotion but a response to the grace and blessings received through Christ. In <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, Paul instructs believers to give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for them in Christ Jesus. The concept of "overflowing" suggests abundance and generosity, indicating that gratitude should be a natural outpouring of a life transformed by Christ. This thankfulness is a witness to others, reflecting the joy and peace that come from a relationship with God. It also serves as a safeguard against the false teachings and philosophies that Paul warns against earlier in <a href="/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, writing to encourage and instruct the believers in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the church addressed in this letter was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_colossian_church.htm">The Colossian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a group of early Christians facing challenges from false teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_jesus.htm">Christ Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in whom believers are to be rooted and built up, as emphasized by Paul.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the backdrop against which Paul writes, warning the Colossians to remain steadfast in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/rooted_in_christ.htm">Rooted in Christ</a></b><br>Just as a tree's roots provide stability and nourishment, our spiritual roots in Christ give us strength and sustenance.

St. Paul bids them seek not only the first basis of their faith, but their continual growth, in Christ alone, by continual "strengthening in the faith" which rests in Him.

"Rooted" is perfect participle, in, plying an abiding fact ("fast rooted"); while "builded up" (literally, <span class="accented">upon</span> or <span class="accented">unto</span>) is in the present tense of a continued process, the prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> also implying growth and gain (<a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6, 10</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>).

This weakens the force of both prepositions (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>), and the emphasis of the repeated "in him."
