In <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>, Paul explains that through baptism, Christians are united with Christ in His death and resurrection. This death signifies a break from the power of sin and the old self. The concept of dying with Christ is central to understanding the believer's new identity and freedom from the law's condemnation. It emphasizes the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice, which allows believers to live a new life in Him.<p><b>to the spiritual forces of the world</b><br>The "spiritual forces of the world" can be understood as the elemental spiritual principles or powers that govern the world system apart from God. In <a href="/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>, Paul refers to these as "elemental spiritual forces." These forces can include legalistic practices, human traditions, and any system that seeks to control or dictate spiritual life apart from Christ. The phrase highlights the contrast between the freedom found in Christ and the bondage of worldly systems.<p><b>why, as though you still belonged to the world</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges believers to consider their new identity in Christ. Having died with Christ, they no longer belong to the world or its systems. In <a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>, Jesus prays for His disciples, stating that they are not of the world, just as He is not of the world. This separation from the world is a call to live according to the values and principles of God's kingdom rather than conforming to worldly standards.<p><b>do you submit to its regulations:</b><br>The regulations referred to here are likely the legalistic rules and human traditions that some false teachers were imposing on the Colossian church. In <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>, Paul warns against being judged by such regulations, which are merely shadows of the reality found in Christ. The submission to these regulations suggests a return to bondage, undermining the freedom and sufficiency found in Christ. This phrase serves as a reminder to hold fast to the truth of the gospel and resist the temptation to revert to legalism or human traditions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, Paul writes to address false teachings and to encourage the believers in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Phrygia, Asia Minor, where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

In virtue of the former participation, he exhorts them to be dead to the law of outward ordinances; in virtue of the latter, to have a life hid with Christ in God.<p>(20) <span class= "bld">If ye be dead with Christ.</span>--The whole idea of the death with Christ and resurrection with Him is summed up by St. Paul in <a href="/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3-9</a>, in direct connection (as also here, see <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>) with the entrance upon Christian life in baptism, "We are buried with Him by baptism unto death . . . we are dead with Christ . . . we are planted together in the likeness of His death . . . that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we also should walk in newness of life . . . planted together in the likeness of His resurrection . . . alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord." The death with Christ is a death unto "the life of the flesh." But this may be (as in <a href="/context/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1-2</a>; <a href="/context/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6-7</a>; <a href="/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>) "the life of sin"; or it may be the outward and visible life "of the world." The latter is the sense to be taken here. This outward life is under "ordinances" (see <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>), under the "rudiments of the world" (see <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>), or, generally, "under law." Of such a life St. Paul says (in <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>), "I through the Law died to the Law, that I might live unto God." There (<a href="/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>), as here, he brands as unspiritual the subjection to the "weak and beggarly elements" of mere ordinances. Of course it is clear that in their place such ordinances have their value, both as means to an end, and as symbols of an inner reality of self-devotion. The true teaching as to these is found in our Lord's declaration to the Pharisees as to spiritual things and outward ordinances, "These things (the spiritual things) ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others (the outward observances) undone" (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>). In later times St. Paul declared with Judicial calmness, "The Law is good if a man use it lawfully" (<a href="/1_timothy/1-8.htm" title="But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;">1Timothy 1:8</a>). But to exalt these things to the first place was a fatal superstition, which, both in its earlier and later phases, he denounces unsparingly. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - The apostle's fourth and last warning is directed against <span class="accented">ascetic rules of life.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world</span> (vers. 8, 10-13; <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>; <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-17</a>). "Therefore" is struck out by the Revisers on the best authority. It would imply a logical dependence of this verse upon the last, which does not exist. This warning, like those of vers. 16, 18, looks back to the previous section, and especially to vers. 8, 10, 12. It is a new application of St. Paul's fundamental principle of the union of the Christian with Christ in his death and resurrection (see notes, vers. 11, 12). Accepting the death of Christ as supplying the means of his redemption (<a href="/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14, 22</a>), and the law of his future life (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>), the Christian breaks with and becomes <span class="accented">dead</span> (<span class="accented">to</span> and) <span class="accented">from</span> all other, former religious principles; which appear to him now but childish, tentative gropings after and preparations for what is given him in Christ (comp. <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-2.htm">Galatians 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>). On "rudiments," see note, ver. 8. There these "rudiments of the world" appear as general ("philosophical") principles of religion, intrinsically false and empty; here they are moral rules of life, mean and worthless substitutes for "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus." (For the Pauline idiom, "died from (so as to be separate, or free from)," comp. <a href="/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 6</a>; <a href="/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Why, as</span> (men) <span class="cmt_word">living in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">world, are you made subject to decrees</span> (<a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). To adopt the rules of the new teachers is to return to the worldly, pre-Christian type of religion which the Christian had once for all abandoned (<a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>). "World" bears the emphasis rather than "living" ("having one's principle of life:" comp. <a href="/1_timothy/5-6.htm">1 Timothy 5:6</a>; <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>). Standing without the article, it signifies "the world as such," in its natural character and attainments, without Christ (ver. 8; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (the verb only here in the New Testament) is passive rather than middle in voice (Winer, p. 326; see Meyer <span class="accented">in loc.</span>); literally, <span class="accented">why are yon being dogmatized, overridden with decrees?</span> Compare "spell" (ver. 8), "judge" (ver. 16), for the domineering spirit of the false teacher. The "dogmas" or "decrees" of ver. 14 (see note) are those of the Divine Law; these are of human imposition (vers. 8, 22), which their authors, however, seem to put upon a level with the former. In each case the <span class="accented">decree</span> is an external enforcement, not an inner principle of life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
