This concept is prevalent in the New Testament, particularly in Paul's writings. The mystery here pertains to God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ, which was not fully understood in previous ages.<p><b>that was hidden</b><br>The idea of something being hidden suggests that it was not accessible or fully understood by previous generations. This aligns with the Old Testament prophecies that hinted at a coming Messiah but did not provide a complete picture. The hidden nature of this mystery underscores God's sovereign timing in revealing His plan.<p><b>for ages and generations</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the long period during which the mystery remained concealed. It spans the entire history of humanity up to the coming of Christ. Throughout the Old Testament, there were glimpses and shadows of God's plan, but the full revelation was reserved for the New Testament era.<p><b>but is now revealed</b><br>The turning point in history is marked by the coming of Jesus Christ, through whom the mystery is unveiled. This revelation is a key theme in the New Testament, highlighting the fulfillment of God's promises and the inauguration of a new covenant. The "now" indicates the present reality of this revelation in the lives of believers.<p><b>to His saints</b><br>The term "saints" refers to all believers who are set apart for God. In the New Testament, this includes both Jewish and Gentile Christians, reflecting the inclusive nature of the gospel. The revelation of the mystery to the saints signifies their role in God's redemptive plan and their understanding of the gospel's full implications.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians, addressing the church in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>- An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the church to whom Paul was writing was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints.htm">Saints</a></b><br>- Refers to the believers in Christ, both in Colossae and universally, who are recipients of the revealed mystery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mystery.htm">Mystery</a></b><br>- A divine truth that was previously hidden but has now been revealed through Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ages_and_generations.htm">Ages and Generations</a></b><br>- Refers to the long period during which the mystery was hidden from humanity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_mystery.htm">Understanding the Mystery</a></b><br>The "mystery" refers to God's redemptive plan through Christ, which was hidden but is now revealed to believers.

The word "mystery" plays a large part in Colossians and Ephesians. It occurs in 1 Corinthians, and twice in the Roman Epistle, written from Corinth. Its use in <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a> is identical with that of the passage before us. The Greek <span class="accented">mysteries</span> were secret religious doctrines and rites made known only to initiated persons, who formed associations statedly assembling at certain sacred spots, of which Eleusis near Athens was the most famous. These systems exercised a vast influence over the Greek mind, and Greek literature is full of allusions to them; but their secret has been well kept, and little is known of their real character. Some of these mystic systems, probably, inculcated doctrines of a purer and more spiritual type than those of the vulgar polytheism. The ascetic and mystical doctrines ascribed to Pythagoras were propagated by secret societies. The language and ideas connected with the mysteries were readily adopted by the Jewish Broad Church of Alexandria, whose endeavour it was to expand Judaism by a symbolical and allegorizing method into a philosophic and universal religious system, and who were compelled to veil their inner doctrine from the eyes of their stricter, unenlightened (or unsophisticated) fellowbelievers. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> appears in the Apocrypha as an epithet of the Divine Wisdom (Wisd. 2:22 Wisd. 8:4; etc.): <a href="/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a> (comp. <a href="/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34, 35</a>) furnished the Old Testament basis of this usage. (See Philo, 'On the Cherubim,' &sect; 12; 'On Fugitives,' &sect; 16; etc., for the place <span class="accented">of mystery</span> in the Alexandrine theology.) St. Paul, writing to men accustomed, either as Greeks or as Hellenistic Jews, to this phraseology, calls the gospel <span class="accented">"a</span> mystery," as that which <span class="accented">is "hidden</span> from the natural understanding and from the previous searchings of men" (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a>). But in the words that follow he repudiates the notion of any secrecy or exclusiveness in its proclamation (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12-4:6</a>); in his language, "mystery is the correlate of revelation." The thrice-repeated <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> ("from," "away"), with the double indication of time, "gives a solemn emphasis" (Meyer) to the statement. <span class="accented">Ages</span> are successive epochs of time, with their states and conditions (comp. <a href="/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>); <span class="accented">generations</span> are successive races of men, with their traditions and hereditary tendencies. But now it was made manifest to his saints (<a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>). The word "reveal" (<a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) indicates a process, "make manifest" points to the result of this Divine act (<a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a>: comp. <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> with Romans 3:21; see Trench's 'Synonyms'). The transition from the participle in the last clause to the strongly assertive finite verb in this almost disappears in English idiom: comp. vers. 5, 6; <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a> (Greek); and see Winer's 'N.T. Grammar,' p. 717, or A. Buttmann, p. 382. There is also a change of tense: the manifestation is a single, sudden event (aorist), breaking through the long and seemingly final concealment of all previous time (present perfect participle); similarly in <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a> (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>, note). <span class="accented">To his sailors</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the Church at large (ver. 2; <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>); but this implies a spiritual qualification (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). "His saints" are the recipients; "his <span class="accented">holy</span> apostles and prophets, in the Spirit," the organs (<a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>) of this manifestation. The Church had long ago formally accepted this revelation (<a href="/acts/11-18.htm">Acts 11:18</a>); it was St. Paul's office to make it practically effectual. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
