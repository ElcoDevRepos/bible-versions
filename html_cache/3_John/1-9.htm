The context suggests that John was addressing issues within the church, likely concerning leadership and hospitality. The early church often relied on letters for guidance and instruction, as the New Testament was still being formed. This reflects the apostolic authority that John held and his concern for the well-being and doctrinal purity of the church.<p><b>but Diotrephes, who loves to be first</b><br>Diotrephes is mentioned only here in the New Testament, and his behavior is characterized by a desire for preeminence. This reflects a common issue in early church communities where personal ambition could disrupt unity. The phrase "loves to be first" suggests a prideful attitude, which is contrary to the teachings of Christ, who emphasized humility and servanthood (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>). Diotrephes' behavior can be seen as a warning against self-centered leadership within the church.<p><b>will not accept our instruction</b><br>This indicates a rejection of apostolic authority, which was crucial for maintaining doctrinal integrity in the early church. Diotrephes' refusal to accept instruction highlights a significant conflict, as the apostles were seen as the primary bearers of Christ's teachings. This rejection could lead to division and false teachings, which were common concerns in the early church (<a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>).

That Diotrephes was bishop of this Church is conjecture; as also that he opposed St. John's emissaries "because they were bent on carrying the gospel to the Gentiles, he himself being, no doubt, both a Jew and of the Jewish faction." He may have been an influential layman. But the context favours the view that he was at least a presbyter. This ecclesiastical Cleon is the type of all vain, noisy, self-asserting teachers, whose main object is to get their own way - an object which they effect by browbeating all who differ from them. No authority is respected and no character spared which seems to oppose their policy. Even an apostle is denounced if he ventures to maintain that the truth may be larger than their view of it. Christian ministers now must not be surprised if they sometimes meet with no better treatment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/3_john/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I have written</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#968;&#940;</span> <span class="translit">(Egrapsa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1125.htm">Strong's 1125: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to 'grave', especially to write; figuratively, to describe.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8135;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
