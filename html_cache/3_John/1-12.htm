The mention of his good testimony from everyone suggests that he is well-regarded among the believers. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/1_timothy/3-7.htm">1 Timothy 3:7</a>, where leaders are encouraged to have a good reputation with outsiders. The universal approval indicates that Demetrius's character and actions are consistent with Christian values, reflecting the fruit of the Spirit as described in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>.<p><b>and from the truth itself</b><br>The phrase "from the truth itself" implies that Demetrius's life is in alignment with the truth of the Gospel. In the Johannine context, "truth" often refers to the teachings of Jesus and the reality of God's revelation through Him (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This suggests that Demetrius's conduct is not only approved by people but also by the standards of divine truth. His life serves as a living testimony to the transformative power of the Gospel, echoing the call to live in truth and love as emphasized in 2 <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>.<p><b>We also testify for him</b><br>The "we" likely refers to the author of the letter, traditionally understood to be the Apostle John, and possibly his close associates. Their testimony adds weight to Demetrius's reputation, as it comes from respected leaders within the early church. This endorsement is significant, as it reflects the communal nature of early Christian witness and the importance of accountability and mutual affirmation among believers, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25-27</a>.<p><b>and you know that our testimony is true</b><br>The assurance that "our testimony is true" underscores the credibility and authority of the author. This echoes John's emphasis on truth throughout his writings (<a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>). The recipients of the letter are reminded of the trustworthiness of the apostolic witness, which is foundational for the faith and practice of the early church. This statement reinforces the reliability of the message and the integrity of those who bear it, encouraging the readers to accept and act upon the commendation of Demetrius.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/demetrius.htm">Demetrius</a></b><br>A Christian mentioned in 3 John, known for his good reputation and adherence to the truth.

All that we can safely infer from what is stated is that he is a person of whom Gaius has not hitherto known much; otherwise this elaborate commendation would scarcely be necessary. Conjectures about him are <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he was the bearer of this Epistle to Gaius, - which is not improbable; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he was a member of the same Church as Diotrephes, and had done good service in opposing him, - which is possible; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that he is the silversmith of Artemis (<a href="/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a>), now "preaching the faith of which he once made havoc," - which is not probable. The name was a common one. It is not easy to determine the meaning of the statement that Demetrius hath the witness of all men, and of the truth itself. Perhaps it means that those who bore testimony to Demetrius were something more than a large body of unanimous human witnesses, strong as such testimony would be; in giving their witness they were guided by "the Spirit of truth." Or it may mean that the facts speak of themselves: as soon as Gaius knows Demetrius he will see that the universal commendation of him is amply justified. The true reading in what follows is, "and <span class="accented">thou</span> knowest that our witness is true" (comp. <a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>; <a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>). The calm confidence with which the writer asserts his authority, both over Diotrephes and also as a witness, confirms us in the belief that "the elder" is no less than the apostle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/3_john/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Demetrius</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#951;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#961;&#943;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(D&#275;m&#275;tri&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1216.htm">Strong's 1216: </a> </span><span class="str2">Demetrius, a silversmith of Ephesus.
