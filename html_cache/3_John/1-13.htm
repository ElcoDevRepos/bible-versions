It reflects the personal nature of early Christian correspondence, where leaders often had much to convey to their fellow believers. The phrase suggests that the letter is part of a larger conversation, emphasizing the importance of personal relationships in the early church. This aligns with other epistles where Paul and other apostles express a desire to share more in person (e.g., <a href="/romans/15-23.htm">Romans 15:23-24</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5-7</a>).<p><b>but I would prefer not to do so with pen and ink</b><br>John's preference for face-to-face communication highlights the limitations of written correspondence in conveying the full depth of his message and emotions. In the ancient world, personal visits were highly valued for their immediacy and relational depth, as seen in 2 <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>, where John expresses a similar sentiment. This preference underscores the importance of community and personal interaction in the early church, reflecting the incarnational aspect of the Christian faith, where presence and personal engagement are vital. The use of "pen and ink" also provides a glimpse into the writing materials of the time, which were less convenient than modern methods, further emphasizing the value of direct communication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, traditionally identified as John the Apostle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples.

"The friends" are perhaps so called in contrast to the hostility of Diotrephes and his party. Instead of warfare, "peace be to thee;" instead of the wicked prating of enemies, the salutations of friends. The elder concludes with his own personal salutation to all the members of his flock who reside near to Gaius (comp. <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/3_john/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#967;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eichon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
