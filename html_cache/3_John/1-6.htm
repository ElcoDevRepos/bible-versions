In the early church, hospitality was a crucial expression of love, especially towards traveling missionaries and teachers. The testimony given to the church indicates that Gaius's actions were not only noticed but also celebrated among the believers. This aligns with the broader New Testament teaching on love as a defining characteristic of Christian discipleship (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>). The early church often met in homes, and the sharing of resources and hospitality was vital for the spread of the Gospel. This testimony serves as an encouragement for believers to continue in love and good works (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>).<p><b>You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of supporting those who are engaged in ministry. The phrase "in a manner worthy of God" suggests that the support given should reflect the character and generosity of God Himself. This is a call to excellence in hospitality and provision, ensuring that those who labor for the Gospel are well cared for. The early church relied heavily on the support of local believers to sustain itinerant preachers and missionaries. This practice is echoed in other New Testament writings, such as Paul's encouragement to the Philippians for their partnership in the Gospel (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-18</a>). The phrase also implies a sense of stewardship and responsibility, reminding believers that their actions should honor God and advance His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gaius.htm">Gaius</a></b><br>The recipient of the letter, a beloved member of the early Christian community, known for his hospitality and support of traveling missionaries.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The broader Christian community that serves as a witness to Gaius's love and hospitality.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/traveling_missionaries.htm">Traveling Missionaries</a></b><br>Individuals who were spreading the Gospel and relied on the support and hospitality of local believers like Gaius.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_testimony.htm">The Testimony</a></b><br>The report given by the missionaries to the church about Gaius's love and support.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_hospitality.htm">The Importance of Hospitality</a></b><br>Hospitality is a tangible expression of Christian love and support for the mission of the Gospel.<br><br>Gaius's example shows that even seemingly small acts of kindness can have a significant impact on the spread of Christianity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_a_testimony_of_love.htm">Living a Testimony of Love</a></b><br>Our actions should reflect the love of Christ, serving as a testimony to others.<br><br>Gaius's love was evident to the church, demonstrating the power of living out one's faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/supporting_god's_work.htm">Supporting God's Work</a></b><br>Supporting those who are actively spreading the Gospel is a way to participate in God's mission.<br><br>Sending missionaries "in a manner worthy of God" means providing for their needs generously and respectfully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_accountability.htm">Community and Accountability</a></b><br>The church serves as a community that witnesses and affirms the actions of its members.<br><br>Being accountable to the church encourages believers to live out their faith authentically.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_3_John_1_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 3 John 1:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_send_them_off_pleasing_God.htm">How can we "send them on their way" in a manner pleasing to God?

Here, the report is entirely positive, showing that genuine Christian love will not stay hidden (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the church</b><p>- The report was given openly before the assembled believers, not in private. That public setting heightens the importance of Gaius&#8217;s example (<a href="/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>, &#8220;When they arrived and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done,&#8221;).<p>- Healthy churches celebrate and imitate what God is doing in individuals (<a href="/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>).<p>- By placing Gaius&#8217;s story before the body, John strengthens the congregation and offers a living illustration of <a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>, &#8220;let us love not in word and speech, but in action and truth,&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about your love</b><p>- &#8220;Love&#8221; here is not sentiment; it is concrete, sacrificial hospitality toward traveling ministers (v. 5).<p>- This echoes <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, &#8220;Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers,&#8221;, and <a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>, &#8220;Show hospitality to one another without complaining,&#8221;.<p>- Gaius&#8217;s care reflects Christ&#8217;s own love (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).

This witness of the brethren before the Church respecting the good deeds done to them is a type and earnest of the witness of Christ at the day of judgment: "I was a stranger, and ye took me in...

This coincidence, consciously or unconsciously made, between the Gospel and Third Epistle, is lost in the rather colourless rendering in the Authorized Version, "after a godly sort." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/3_john/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[They]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7987;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">have testified</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#973;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#940;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(emartyr&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3140.htm">Strong's 3140: </a> </span><span class="str2">To witness, bear witness, give evidence, testify, give a good report.
