The "sons" symbolize the people of Israel, who have not responded to God's corrective measures. This echoes the theme of divine discipline found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>, where God disciplines His people as a father disciplines his son. The futility of these efforts highlights the stubbornness and rebellion of the Israelites, reminiscent of the repeated cycles of sin and repentance in the Book of Judges.<p><b>they accepted no discipline.</b><br>The Israelites' refusal to accept discipline underscores their hardened hearts and unwillingness to repent. This is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where the people often ignore or reject God's warnings. <a href="/proverbs/12.htm">Proverbs 12:1</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a> emphasize the importance of accepting discipline as a path to wisdom and righteousness. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on obedience to God's law, yet the people frequently strayed, leading to their downfall.<p><b>Your own sword has devoured your prophets</b><br>This phrase indicates that the Israelites themselves are responsible for the persecution and killing of the prophets sent by God. Historically, prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others faced hostility and violence from their own people. This self-destructive behavior is a tragic irony, as the prophets were sent to guide and save them. The reference to the "sword" suggests internal conflict and betrayal, as seen in the accounts of prophets like Zechariah, who was stoned in the temple court (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</a>).<p><b>like a voracious lion.</b><br>The imagery of a "voracious lion" conveys the ferocity and relentlessness with which the Israelites have turned against their prophets. Lions are often used in the Bible to symbolize strength and danger, as in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where the devil is described as a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. This metaphor highlights the intensity of the people's rebellion and their insatiable appetite for rejecting God's messengers. It also serves as a stark warning of the consequences of such actions, as unchecked sin leads to destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often rebuked by God through the prophets for their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers sent by God to guide, warn, and call the people back to righteousness.

The cities and towns of Judah are represented as so many mothers, and the populations as their children. It would, no doubt, be more natural to take "children" literally; but then we must read the verb in the next clause, "Ye have received," as the Septuagint actually renders. In the former case the "smiting" will refer to all God's "sore judgments" -sword, drought, famine, pestilence; in the latter, to the loss of life in battle. <span class="cmt_word">Your own sword hath devoured your prophets</span> (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/24-21.htm">2 Chronicles 24:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>).
