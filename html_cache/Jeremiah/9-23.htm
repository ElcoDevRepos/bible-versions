In the prophetic tradition, such declarations are common, underscoring the importance of the message. The phrase is reminiscent of the prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament, indicating that the following words are not merely human opinion but divine revelation.<p><b>Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom:</b><br>Wisdom in the ancient Near East was highly valued, often associated with skill in governance, decision-making, and understanding of the world. However, this passage warns against pride in human intellect. Biblical wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, often contrasts human wisdom with divine wisdom, which is superior and eternal. This phrase echoes themes found in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19-20</a>, where Paul speaks of God nullifying the wisdom of the wise.<p><b>nor the strong man in his strength:</b><br>Strength, both physical and military, was a source of pride and security in ancient cultures. The warning here is against relying on human power, which is fleeting and ultimately insufficient. This is illustrated in the story of David and Goliath, where God's power triumphs over human might. The phrase also connects to <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>, which states that a king is not saved by his great army.<p><b>nor the wealthy man in his riches:</b><br>Wealth was often seen as a sign of blessing and security. However, the Bible frequently warns against the dangers of trusting in material wealth. Jesus' teachings in the Gospels, such as the parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>), highlight the folly of placing trust in riches rather than in God. This phrase serves as a reminder that true security and worth are found in a relationship with God, not in material possessions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
