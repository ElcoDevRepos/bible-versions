The society was characterized by falsehoods and betrayal, both in personal relationships and in their dealings with God. This mirrors the broader theme in Jeremiah where the prophet condemns the moral and spiritual corruption of the nation. The imagery of "dwelling" suggests that deception was not just present but was an integral part of their environment, affecting every aspect of life. This can be compared to the situation in <a href="/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3-4</a>, where lies and injustice are rampant.<p><b>in their deceit they refuse to know Me,&#8221;</b><br>The refusal to know God is a deliberate choice, indicating a hardened heart and a willful rejection of divine truth. This echoes the warnings in <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where a lack of knowledge of God leads to destruction. The deceit here is not just interpersonal but spiritual, as the people deceive themselves into thinking they can live without accountability to God. This refusal is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel often turns away from God despite His continuous call to repentance.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and finality of God's pronouncement. It is a reminder that the message comes directly from God, not merely from the prophet. The use of "declares" emphasizes the certainty and seriousness of the statement. Throughout the book of Jeremiah, this formula is used to affirm that the words spoken are not Jeremiah's own but are divinely inspired, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>. This serves as a warning to the people that ignoring these words is tantamount to ignoring God Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

It is, however, better to take them as spoken by Jehovah to the prophet individually.
