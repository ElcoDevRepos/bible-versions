In the context of Jeremiah, God is addressing the people of Judah, who have turned away from Him. This reflects the broader biblical theme that nothing is hidden from God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>, "The eyes of the LORD are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good." It serves as a reminder of God's constant awareness and presence, reinforcing His role as a just judge who observes the paths of all individuals.<p><b>They are not hidden from My face,</b><br>The imagery of God's face signifies His personal attention and involvement. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the face of a deity symbolized favor or disfavor. Here, it indicates that the people cannot escape God's scrutiny. This is consistent with <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges that there is nowhere to flee from God's presence. The phrase underscores the futility of attempting to hide sin from God, as He is fully aware of all actions and thoughts.<p><b>and their guilt is not concealed from My eyes.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the theme of accountability. The people of Judah are guilty of idolatry and disobedience, and God is making it clear that their sins are fully visible to Him. This aligns with <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>, which states, "Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account." The phrase serves as a warning that divine judgment is inevitable for unrepentant sin, and it calls for introspection and repentance. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption through Jesus Christ, who offers forgiveness and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was often warned by prophets like Jeremiah about impending judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who sees all actions and knows the hearts of His people, emphasizing His omniscience and justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>Refers to the sin and moral corruption of the people of Judah, which is not hidden from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment.htm">Divine Judgment</a></b><br>The event of God's impending punishment on Judah for their persistent sinfulness and rebellion against Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God sees all actions and knows all thoughts.
