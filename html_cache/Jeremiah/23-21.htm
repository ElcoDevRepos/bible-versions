Throughout the Old Testament, God often sent prophets to deliver His messages to the people. However, during Jeremiah's time, many individuals claimed to be prophets without being commissioned by God. This reflects a broader theme in the Bible where true prophets are distinguished by their divine calling, as seen in the stories of Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). The false prophets in Jeremiah's time were misleading the people, often promoting messages of peace and prosperity contrary to God's warnings of impending judgment.<p><b>yet they have run with their message</b><br>The imagery of "running" suggests urgency and eagerness. These false prophets were quick to spread their own messages, which were not from God. This eagerness can be contrasted with the true prophets who often hesitated or were reluctant to deliver God's difficult messages, such as Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>) and Jeremiah himself (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>). The false prophets' messages were likely more appealing to the people, as they often promised peace and security (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>), which were contrary to the warnings of judgment that God was actually delivering through His true prophets.<p><b>I did not speak to them</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine authority behind true prophecy. In the biblical context, a prophet's legitimacy is based on whether God has spoken to them. The false prophets lacked this divine communication, making their messages void of true spiritual authority. This is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God emphasizes that His words are the source of truth and guidance (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-22</a>). The absence of God's voice in these false prophets' messages highlights their deception and the danger they posed to the community.<p><b>yet they have prophesied</b><br>Despite not receiving a word from God, these individuals still claimed to speak on His behalf. This act of false prophecy is condemned throughout Scripture, as it leads people away from God's true intentions and plans. In the New Testament, Jesus warns against false prophets who come in sheep's clothing but are inwardly ravenous wolves (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>). The persistence of false prophecy throughout biblical history serves as a warning to discern the true voice of God amidst many competing claims. The false prophets' actions in Jeremiah's time were not only misleading but also a direct challenge to God's authority and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals who claimed to speak on behalf of God but were not sent by Him.
