The "day" refers to a specific time of divine intervention and judgment. The title "LORD GOD of Hosts" underscores God's supreme command over heavenly armies, indicating His power to execute judgment. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a> and <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, where the "day of the Lord" is a time of reckoning and divine justice.<p><b>a day of vengeance against His foes</b><br>The "day of vengeance" signifies a time when God enacts justice against those who oppose Him. This is not merely punitive but serves to uphold divine righteousness. The idea of God taking vengeance is consistent with passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> and <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where God reserves the right to repay. In the context of Jeremiah, this vengeance is directed against Egypt, a nation that had historically oppressed Israel.<p><b>The sword will devour until it is satisfied</b><br>The imagery of the sword "devouring" conveys the thoroughness and inevitability of God's judgment. The sword is often a symbol of divine judgment in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>. This phrase suggests a complete and unrelenting execution of justice, leaving no room for escape or mercy for those who are judged.<p><b>until it is quenched with their blood</b><br>This graphic imagery highlights the severity of the judgment. The notion of the sword being "quenched" with blood indicates the fulfillment of divine wrath. It reflects the seriousness of sin and the consequences that follow, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> and <a href="/revelation/14-20.htm">Revelation 14:20</a>, where bloodshed is a result of divine judgment.<p><b>For the Lord GOD of Hosts will hold a sacrifice</b><br>The concept of a "sacrifice" here is metaphorical, representing the destruction of Egypt as an offering to God. Sacrifices in the Old Testament were acts of worship and atonement, but here it signifies the complete giving over of Egypt to divine judgment. This is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, where the judgment of Edom is described in sacrificial terms.<p><b>in the land of the north by the River Euphrates</b><br>The "land of the north" refers to the geographical location of Babylon, which was north of Israel and a significant power in the region. The River Euphrates was a major boundary and a site of many historical battles. This setting underscores the historical context of Babylon's rise and Egypt's decline, as Babylon would eventually conquer Egypt. The mention of the Euphrates connects to other prophecies, such as those in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50</a>, where Babylon plays a central role in God's plan for judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god_of_hosts.htm">The Lord GOD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.

Egypt&#8217;s defeat was not random geopolitical shift but divine vengeance&#8212;holy, measured, complete. The vivid language of devouring swords and blood-quenched justice reminds us that sin is deadly serious. Yet embedded in the terror is hope: God&#8217;s justice means evil will not stand, and His orchestration of history points to the greater sacrifice of Christ, where judgment and mercy met. For believers, that assurance inspires faithfulness; for the rebellious, it issues an urgent call to surrender before the next &#8220;day of the Lord&#8221; arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">This is the day of the Lord God of hosts.--</span>The prophet contemplates the issue of all these great preparations, and sees that they will end in a disastrous overthrow, the righteous retribution for long years of cruelty and outrage. In doing so he falls back upon the language of earlier prophets (<a href="/isaiah/34-8.htm" title="For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.">Isaiah 34:8</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-7.htm" title="Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guests.">Zephaniah 1:7</a>), in part also upon that of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-42.htm" title="I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges on the enemy.">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>. There is to be a "great sacrifice," and the army of Egypt is the destined victim; and the banks of the Euphrates (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Carchemish) are to be as the altar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The contrast.</span> <span class="accented">And yet that day is</span> (<span class="accented">the day</span>) <span class="accented">of the Lord, Jehovah Sabdoth</span> (the rendering of the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">For this is the day,</span> etc., is clearly a mistake). The "day of Jehovah" is an expression so familiar to us that we are in danger of losing a part of its sublime meaning. It is, in brief, "that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient .... This great crisis is called a day, in antithesis to the ages of the Divine long suffering: it is <span class="accented">Jehovah's</span> day, because, without a special Divine interposition, there would be no issue out of the perplexities and miseries of human life." We may say, with equal truth, that there are many "days of the Lord," and that there is only one. Every great revolution is a fresh stage in the great judgment day; "<span class="accented">die Weltgesehichte ist das Weltgericht"</span> (Schiller). The <span class="accented">loci classici</span> for the expression in the prophets are <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18, 20</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6, 9</a> (in <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>, the phraseology closely resembles that of our passage - "for there is a day unto Jehovah Sabaoth;" Jehovah, that is, hath it in readiness in the supersensible world, where there is no time, and where all God's purposes have an ideal, but no less real existence. We might, in fact, render our passage, "but that day (is the day that belongeth) unto the Lord," etc.). The Lord here, as generally elsewhere, is that expressive form which intimates the universal lordship of the God who has revealed himself to Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The sword.</span> A comparison with <a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> suggests that it is "the sword of the Lord" which is meant - a symbolic phrase for the Divine vengeance, which meets us again in <a href="/jeremiah/12-12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41, 42</a>; <a href="/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a> (comp. <a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>); <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5, 6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>; <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>. If Jehovah can be spoken of as having an Arm, a Hand, and a Bow, why not also as having a sword? Both expressions represent the self-revealing side of the Divine nature, and are not merely poetical ornaments, but correspond to awful objective realities. Divine vengeance exists, and must exercise itself on all who oppose the Divine will. <span class="cmt_word">Hath a sacrifice.</span> The same figurative expression occurs in <a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, and, developed at considerable length, in <a href="/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-20</a>, where the slaughtered foes are described as fatted beasts, rams, lambs, he-goats, bullocks - animals employed in the Jewish sacrifices. This, then, is the purpose for which this immense host "rolls up from Africa" - it is that it may fall by the Euphrates, at once as a proof of God's justice, and as a warning to transgressors. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">That</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
