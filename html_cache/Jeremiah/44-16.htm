Jeremiah, a prophet during the late 7th and early 6th centuries BC, often delivered messages from God to the people of Judah. The phrase "in the name of the LORD" signifies that Jeremiah's message was not his own but was divinely inspired. This reflects the common biblical theme of prophets speaking on behalf of God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-19</a>, where God promises to raise up a prophet like Moses. The people's acknowledgment of the message being from the LORD highlights their awareness of its divine origin, yet they choose to reject it.<p><b>we will not listen to you!</b><br>This outright refusal to heed Jeremiah's message is emblematic of the broader rebellion of the people of Judah against God's commands. Historically, this period was marked by idolatry and alliances with foreign nations, contrary to God's instructions. The people's defiance is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where God's messages were ignored, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>, where the people mocked God's messengers. This rejection also foreshadows the ultimate consequence of their disobedience: the Babylonian exile. The refusal to listen to God's word through His prophets is a recurring theme that underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
