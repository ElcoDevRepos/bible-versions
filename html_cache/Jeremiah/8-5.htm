The question implies a sense of bewilderment and sorrow from God, who has consistently shown mercy and provided guidance. The turning away signifies a deliberate choice to abandon God's covenant, echoing the recurring theme of Israel's spiritual adultery found throughout the Old Testament. This turning away can be seen as a rejection of God's law and a preference for idolatry, as seen in passages like <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>, where God expresses similar sentiments about Israel's stubbornness.<p><b>Why does Jerusalem always turn away?</b><br>Jerusalem, as the capital city, represents the heart of the nation and its spiritual state. The city's repeated turning away highlights a pattern of rebellion and apostasy. Historically, Jerusalem was the center of worship and the location of the Temple, making its unfaithfulness particularly grievous. This phrase underscores the city's role in leading the nation astray, as seen in the actions of its leaders and prophets who often led the people into idolatry and injustice, as documented in <a href="/2_kings/21-11.htm">2 Kings 21:11-15</a>. The phrase also foreshadows the eventual destruction of Jerusalem as a consequence of its persistent sin.<p><b>They cling to deceit;</b><br>This part of the verse points to the people's embrace of falsehoods and lies, both in their personal lives and in their religious practices. The deceit may refer to false prophets who misled the people with messages of peace and security when judgment was imminent, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>. It also suggests a self-deception, where the people convince themselves that they are secure despite their disobedience. This clinging to deceit is a willful act, indicating a preference for comforting lies over the hard truth of God's impending judgment.<p><b>they refuse to return.</b><br>The refusal to return signifies a stubborn resistance to repentance and reconciliation with God. Despite numerous warnings and calls to repentance through prophets like Jeremiah, the people persist in their rebellion. This refusal is not due to ignorance but a deliberate choice, highlighting the hardness of their hearts. The concept of returning, or repentance, is central to the prophetic message, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>, where God calls His people to return and find salvation. This refusal ultimately leads to the fulfillment of prophetic warnings of exile and destruction, serving as a sobering reminder of the consequences of unrepentant sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
