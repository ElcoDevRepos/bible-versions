The "evil" refers to their idolatry and moral corruption, which were prevalent during the reigns of several kings, including Manasseh and Amon. The phrase "in My sight" emphasizes God's omniscience and His personal witness to their sins. This is consistent with the covenantal relationship where God is the suzerain and Judah is the vassal, expected to follow His laws. The declaration "declares the LORD" underscores the authority and seriousness of the message, as it comes directly from Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel.<p><b>They have set up their abominations in the house that bears My Name,</b><br>The "abominations" refer to idols and pagan altars that were introduced into the Temple in Jerusalem, which was meant to be the dwelling place of God's Name (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>). This act of setting up idols in the Temple was a direct violation of the first and second commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and was considered spiritual adultery. The Temple was central to Jewish worship and identity, and its defilement symbolized the nation's spiritual decay. Archaeological findings, such as altars and idols from this period, corroborate the biblical account of widespread idolatry.<p><b>and so have defiled it.</b><br>The defilement of the Temple signifies a breach in the sacredness and purity required for worship. In the Old Testament, the Temple was the place where God&#8217;s presence dwelled among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). By introducing foreign gods, the people of Judah not only disrespected God but also invited His judgment. This defilement is a precursor to the eventual destruction of the Temple by the Babylonians in 586 BC, as prophesied by Jeremiah and other prophets. Theologically, this defilement points to the need for a new covenant and a perfect temple, which Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_judah.htm">The Sons of Judah</a></b><br>Refers to the people of the southern kingdom of Judah, who were descendants of the tribe of Judah.

but it is quite possible that the pendulum swung back again when his death left the idolatrous party in Judah free to act, and that this special aggravation of the evil, the desecration of the Temple of Jehovah by "abominations" of idol-worship, re-appeared together with the worship of the Queen of Heaven and the sacrifices to Molech. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have set their abominations</span>, etc.;
