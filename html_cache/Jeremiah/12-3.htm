The prophet acknowledges that God has an intimate understanding of his character and intentions. This reflects the biblical theme that God knows the hearts of all people (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). Jeremiah's appeal to God's knowledge of him underscores his sincerity and the authenticity of his prophetic mission.<p><b>You see me and test my heart toward You.</b><br>Jeremiah recognizes that God not only sees his external actions but also tests his inner motivations and faithfulness. This testing is a common biblical theme, seen in the lives of figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and Job (<a href="/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>). The testing of the heart is a divine process to refine and prove one's faith and commitment to God, aligning with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>.<p><b>Drag away the wicked like sheep to the slaughter</b><br>Jeremiah calls for divine justice against the wicked, using the metaphor of sheep being led to slaughter. This imagery is vivid in its depiction of judgment and is consistent with prophetic literature that often uses agricultural metaphors. The idea of the wicked being led to slaughter is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, which also serves as a type of Christ, the Lamb led to slaughter for the sins of humanity.<p><b>and set them apart for the day of carnage.</b><br>This phrase speaks to the concept of divine retribution and the setting apart of the wicked for judgment. The "day of carnage" refers to a time of God's wrath and justice, a theme prevalent in prophetic writings (<a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>). This separation of the wicked for judgment is reminiscent of the parable of the sheep and goats in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, where the righteous and wicked are divided for their respective fates.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is speaking in this verse, expressing his deep trust in God and his frustration with the wicked.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who knows and tests the hearts of His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who oppose God and His prophet, whom Jeremiah asks God to judge.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep_to_be_slaughtered.htm">Sheep to be slaughtered</a></b><br>A metaphor for the impending judgment and destruction of the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_carnage.htm">Day of Carnage</a></b><br>A prophetic reference to the time of God's judgment against the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God knows us intimately, including our thoughts and intentions.

In words in which the natural impatience of suffering shows itself as clearly as in the complaints of Psalms 69, 109, he asks that the judgment may be immediate, open, terrible. As if recalling the very phrase which he had himself but lately used (<a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm" title="But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.">Jeremiah 11:19</a>), he prays that they too may be as "sheep for the slaughter," <span class= "ital">dragged </span>or <span class= "ital">torn away </span>from their security to the righteous penalty of their wrong.<p><span class= "bld">Prepare.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">devote. </span>The Hebrew word, as in <a href="/jeremiah/6-4.htm" title="Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon.
