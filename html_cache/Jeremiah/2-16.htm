Memphis, known as the capital of Lower Egypt, was a major political and religious center. Tahpanhes, also known as Daphnae, was a frontier city in the eastern Nile Delta. These cities represent Egypt's power and influence. Historically, Egypt was often a place of refuge for Israelites, but also a source of oppression and idolatry. The mention of these cities highlights the political alliances and dependencies that Israel formed, often contrary to God's commands to rely solely on Him.<p><b>have shaved the crown of your head.</b><br>Shaving the crown of the head is a metaphor for humiliation and disgrace. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, shaving the head was a sign of mourning or subjugation. This imagery suggests that Israel, by relying on Egypt, has subjected itself to shame and loss of dignity. Biblically, this act symbolizes the loss of glory and strength, as seen in the story of Samson (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17-19</a>).

God reminds Judah that the very nation they ran to for help (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;3</a>) is now turning on them. Like a once-trusted friend who betrays, Egypt proves unreliable (<a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>). The mention of &#8220;men&#8221; personalizes the threat: real soldiers, real consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Tahpanhes</b><p>Tahpanhes, another strategic Egyptian city (<a href="/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7&#8211;9</a>; 44:1), housed a fortress on Egypt&#8217;s eastern border. When Judah fled there after Jerusalem&#8217;s fall (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19&#8211;22</a>), they thought they&#8217;d escape Babylon. Instead, God says the hurt will come even from this supposed refuge (<a href="/lamentations/4-17.htm">Lamentations 4:17</a>). Both cities together picture the whole breadth of Egypt betraying Judah&#8217;s trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have shaved</b><p>Shaving in Scripture often marks humiliation and grief. Think of <a href="/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>, where the razor of Assyria shaves Israel, or <a href="/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>, where Moab&#8217;s people shave their heads in mourning. Here Egypt doesn&#8217;t just refuse aid; it actively disgraces Judah. What Judah hoped would protect them now humiliates them&#8212;a vivid reversal of <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>&#8217;s call to trust the Lord, not horses and chariots.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the crown of your head</b><p>&#8220;The crown&#8221; speaks of honor, identity, and leadership (<a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>; <a href="/lamentations/5-16.htm">Lamentations 5:16</a>). By shaving it, Egypt strips Judah of dignity and sovereignty. God warned that forsaking Him would bring this shame (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>). Now, instead of wearing the royal diadem of God&#8217;s people (<a href="/isaiah/62-3.htm">Isaiah 62:3</a>), Judah is bald&#8212;exposed, mocked, and leaderless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a> paints a sobering picture: the very Egyptians Judah trusted have turned into agents of disgrace. Memphis and Tahpanhes symbolize the full reach of Egypt&#8217;s betrayal; shaving depicts deep humiliation; the lost crown shows stripped honor. When God&#8217;s people look to human powers instead of the Lord, those powers cannot save and often bring shame. Trusting in God alone secures the true crown that no enemy can remove (<a href="/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Also the children of Noph . . .</span>--We pass from the language of poetry to that of history, and the actual enemies of Israel appear on the scene, not as the threatening danger in the north, but in the far south. The words indicate that the prophet set himself from the first, as Isaiah had done (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm" title="Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!">Isaiah 31:1</a>), against the policy of an Egyptian alliance. The LXX. translators, following, we must believe, an Egyptian tradition, identify the Hebrew Noph with Memphis in northern Egypt; later critics, with Napata in the south. Its conjunction with Tahapanes, the Daphnae of the Greeks, which was on the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile, and on the frontier, seems in favour of the former view.<p><span class= "bld">Have broken.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">shall feed on, lay waste, depasture, </span>so as to produce baldness.

This is the climax of the calamity. Noph, called Moph in the Hebrew text of <a href="/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>, is generally identified with Memphis (after the Septuagint), which was called in the inscriptions Mennufr, or "the good abode," but may possibly be Napata, the Nap of the inscriptions, the residency of the Ethiopian dynasty (De Rouge'). <span class="cmt_word">Tahapanes</span>. The Hebrew form is <span class="accented">Takhpanes</span> or <span class="accented">Tahhpanhhes</span>. This was a fortified frontier town on the Pelusiot arm of the Nile, called in Greek Daphnae (Herod., 2:20), or Taphnae (Septuagint here). <span class="cmt_word">Have broken,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">shall break</span>, or (for the pointing in the Hebrew Bible requires this change) <span class="accented">shall feed off</span> (or <span class="accented">depasture</span>). From this verse onwards, Judah is personified as a woman, as appears from the suffixes in the Hebrew. Baldness was a great mark of disgrace (<a href="/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>). There is a striking parallel to this passage in <a href="/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18-20</a>, where, in punishment of the negotiations of Ahaz with Assyria, the prophet threatens an invasion of Judah both by Assyria and by Egypt: and employs the very. same figure (see ver. 20). So here, the devastation threatened by Jeremiah is the punishment of the unhallowed coquetting with the Egyptian power of which the Jewish rulers had been recently guilty. The fact which corresponds to this prediction is the defeat of Josiah at Megiddo, and the consequent subjugation of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>). The abruptness with which ver. 16 follows upon ver. 15 suggests that some words have fallen out of the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Memphis</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1430;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5297.htm">Strong's 5297: </a> </span><span class="str2">Memphis -- a city in Egypt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Tahpanhes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1425;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;a&#7717;&#183;pan&#183;&#7717;&#234;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8471.htm">Strong's 8471: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tahpanhes -- a city in Egypt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have shaved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;&#8216;&#363;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7462.htm">Strong's 7462: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tend a, flock, pasture it, in, to graze, to rule, to associate with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the crown of your head.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1511;&#1465;&#1469;&#1491;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;q&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6936.htm">Strong's 6936: </a> </span><span class="str2">Head, crown of the head</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm">OT Prophets: Jeremiah 2:16 The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes (Jer.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/jeremiah/2-15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Jeremiah 2:15"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 2:15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/jeremiah/2-17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Jeremiah 2:17"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 2:17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
