Josiah was known for his religious reforms and efforts to return Judah to the worship of Yahweh, as detailed in <a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22-23</a>. His reign marked a significant period of spiritual renewal, yet it was also a time of political instability with the looming threat of Babylonian power.<p><b>until this very day&#8212;twenty-three years&#8212;</b><br>Jeremiah's ministry spanned over two decades, highlighting his perseverance and faithfulness in delivering God's messages despite opposition. This period included the reigns of several kings, from Josiah to Zedekiah, and encompassed significant events such as the fall of Nineveh and the rise of Babylon. The duration emphasizes the patience and long-suffering nature of God, who continually warned His people over an extended period.<p><b>the word of the LORD has come to me,</b><br>Jeremiah emphasizes the divine origin of his message, asserting that his prophecies are not his own but are revelations from God. This underscores the authority and authenticity of his words, aligning with the prophetic tradition where prophets served as God's mouthpieces. The phrase also reflects the intimate relationship between Jeremiah and God, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-10</a>, where God calls and commissions him.<p><b>and I have spoken to you again and again,</b><br>Jeremiah's repeated efforts to communicate God's message illustrate his dedication and the urgency of the prophetic warnings. This persistence is a testament to God's desire for His people to repent and return to Him. The phrase echoes the biblical theme of God's relentless pursuit of His people, as seen in other prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>but you have not listened.</b><br>This phrase highlights the people's stubbornness and refusal to heed God's warnings, a recurring theme in the prophetic books. Their disobedience and hard-heartedness ultimately led to the Babylonian exile, fulfilling the prophecies of judgment. This rejection of God's word serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of ignoring divine instruction, paralleling the warnings given by Jesus in the New Testament about the importance of hearing and obeying God's word (e.g., <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

By anchoring the message in verifiable history, the prophet shows that God&#8217;s warnings did not appear out of nowhere; they were woven into real events and rulers. Josiah&#8217;s sweeping reforms had opened the door for national revival, yet the nation&#8217;s heart largely resisted lasting change.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; God speaks into specific times and places; His word is never abstract.<p>&#8226; Even seasons of outward reform can hide inward resistance (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until this very day&#8212;twenty-three years</b><p>Jeremiah counts the years: twenty-three of them.

Isaiah had foretold this hardness (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9&#8211;10</a>), and Stephen later cited the same pattern (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>&#8226; Failure to listen is never due to unclear revelation but to unwilling hearts.<p>&#8226; Continued refusal ultimately leads to judgment, as the Babylonian invasion soon proved (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3</a> captures a prophet&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233; of faithful service and a nation&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233; of stubborn refusal.
