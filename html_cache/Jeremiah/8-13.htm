In the context of Jeremiah, God is speaking through the prophet to the people of Judah, warning them of the consequences of their persistent disobedience and idolatry. The harvest represents not only physical sustenance but also the prosperity and security that come from God's favor. This echoes the covenant curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38-42</a>, where disobedience leads to agricultural failure. The declaration by the LORD emphasizes the certainty and authority of this pronouncement.<p><b>There will be no grapes on the vine,</b><br>Grapes were a staple in the diet of ancient Israel and a symbol of abundance and blessing (<a href="/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23-24</a>). The absence of grapes signifies a severe economic and social impact, as wine was a common beverage and used in religious rituals. This imagery is also used in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where Israel is compared to a vineyard that fails to produce good fruit, leading to judgment. The vine is often a metaphor for Israel itself (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>), and the lack of grapes underscores the nation's spiritual barrenness.<p><b>nor figs on the tree,</b><br>Figs were another important crop in ancient Israel, often associated with peace and prosperity (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>). The fig tree is used symbolically in the Bible to represent Israel (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, <a href="/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>). The absence of figs indicates a withdrawal of God's blessing and protection, leading to national calamity. This imagery is also prophetic, as Jesus later curses a barren fig tree in <a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12-14</a>, symbolizing judgment on unfruitfulness.<p><b>and even the leaf will wither.</b><br>Withering leaves suggest a complete lack of life and vitality, pointing to the totality of the judgment. In a broader biblical context, withering is often associated with God's judgment and the consequences of sin (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3-4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7-8</a>). This phrase emphasizes the thoroughness of the devastation, leaving nothing untouched. It serves as a stark warning of the spiritual and physical consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>Whatever I have given them will be lost to them.&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase underscores the theme of loss due to disobedience. It reflects the principle that blessings are contingent upon faithfulness to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The gifts and prosperity that God had bestowed upon Israel, including the land itself, would be forfeited as a result of their unfaithfulness. This loss is not just material but also spiritual, as the people are alienated from the source of their blessings. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the kingdom being taken away from those who do not produce its fruits (<a href="/matthew/21-43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

While loss is severe, it is also purposeful, driving the people to recognize the Giver they have forgotten. For every generation the lesson is clear: fruitfulness flows from wholehearted trust and obedience to the LORD, the unfailing Keeper of the harvest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">I will surely consume.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Gathering, I will sweep away</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>I will gather and sweep away, the two verbs being all but identical in sound and spelling, so that the construction has almost the force of the emphatic Hebrew reduplication.<p><span class= "bld">There shall be.</span>--These words are not in the Hebrew, and the verse describes, not the judgment of Jehovah on the state of Israel, but that state itself. <span class= "ital">There are no grapes on the vine, no figs on the fig-tree, the leaf fadeth. </span>The words are figurative rather than literal, after the manner of <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm" title="Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm" title="And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the middle of it, and also made a wine press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.">Isaiah 5:2</a>. Israel is a degenerate vine, a barren fig-tree. Here, again, we find an echo of the teaching of Jeremiah in that of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/21-19.htm" title="And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.">Matthew 21:19</a>; <a href="/context/luke/13-6.htm" title="He spoke also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.">Luke 13:6-9</a>). In <a href="/micah/7-1.htm" title="Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the first ripe fruit.">Micah 7:1</a> we have another example of the same figurative language. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13</span> - <a href="/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>. - Further description of the judgment; grief of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall be no grapes</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">there are no grapes</span>... <span class="accented">and the leaf is faded</span>. It is the actual condition of things which the prophet describes. Elsewhere Judah is compared to a vine with bad grapes (<a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>); here the vine does not even pretend to bear fruit. Another figure is that of a barren fig tree (comp. <a href="/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the things that I have given them</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and I gave them that which they transgress</span> (viz. <span class="accented">laws</span>). The construction, however, which this rendering implies is not perfectly natural, though supported by most of the ancient versions (except the Septuagint, which omits the words), and it is better to alter a single vowel-point, and render "And I will give them to those who shall pass over them." The phrase to pass away is constantly used of an invading host; e.g. <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-10.htm">Daniel 11:10, 40</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will take away their harvest,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1465;&#1445;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;s&#333;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_622.htm">Strong's 622: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gather for, any purpose, to receive, take away, remove</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1465;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">There will be no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grapes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6025.htm">Strong's 6025: </a> </span><span class="str2">A grape</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on the vine,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1436;&#1508;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(bag&#183;ge&#183;p&#772;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
