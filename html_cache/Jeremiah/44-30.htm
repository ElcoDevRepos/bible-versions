In the prophetic tradition, such declarations underscore that the message is not from the prophet's own mind but directly from God. This establishes the seriousness and reliability of the prophecy.<p><b>Behold, I will deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who seek his life:</b><br>Pharaoh Hophra, also known as Apries, ruled Egypt during a tumultuous period. Historically, he faced internal strife and external threats, which eventually led to his downfall. This prophecy highlights God's sovereignty over nations, demonstrating that even powerful rulers are subject to His will. The mention of delivering Hophra into the hands of his enemies parallels the fate of other leaders who opposed God's plans, showing a pattern of divine justice.<p><b>just as I delivered Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,</b><br>Zedekiah was the last king of Judah, and his reign ended with the Babylonian conquest. This comparison serves as a reminder of the fulfillment of past prophecies, reinforcing the certainty of Hophra's fate. The historical context of Zedekiah's capture and the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC is a pivotal moment in Jewish history, illustrating the consequences of disobedience to God.<p><b>the enemy who was seeking his life:</b><br>Both Hophra and Zedekiah faced adversaries who were determined to overthrow them. This phrase underscores the inevitability of God's judgment against those who oppose His will. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of divine retribution and the futility of resisting God's plans. The mention of enemies seeking their lives highlights the personal nature of these conflicts and the ultimate triumph of God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh_hophra.htm">Pharaoh Hophra</a></b><br>The king of Egypt during the time of Jeremiah, known for his alliance with Judah against Babylon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who was captured by Nebuchadnezzar and witnessed the fall of Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon, who conquered Jerusalem and took many Jews into exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A nation often seen as a place of refuge for the Israelites, yet also a symbol of reliance on worldly powers instead of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and their leaders.

The king thus named--the Apries of Herod. II., 161, 163, 169--was the son of Psammis, and reigned for twenty-five years. He attacked Sidon by land and Tyre by sea, presumably before Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of Ph?nicia, and then sent his armies against Cyrene. The issue of that campaign was disastrous, and his subjects revolted. His general, Amasis, who was sent to pacify the rebels, put himself at their head. Apries was deposed, kept in honourable imprisonment at Sais for a time, and afterwards strangled. His reign extended from B.C. 594 to 569. Jeremiah probably delivered his prediction <span class= "ital">circ. </span>B.C. 580, and it is the last recorded event in his life. A late Christian tradition, resting probably on a Jewish one, states that then, or shortly afterwards, the Egyptian Jews, irritated by his reproaches, rose up against him and stoned him to death. (Tertull. <span class= "ital">Adv. Gnost, </span>c. 8; Hieron. <span class= "ital">Adv. Jovin, </span>ii. 37.) In <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a> ("they were stoned ") we may probably find a reference to his fate as one of the "noble army of martyrs."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will give Pharaoh-hophra,</span> etc. The sign consists in the capture of Hophra by his deadly enemies. Henceforth he will live in constant alarm, for he is in the hands of those "that seek his life." All that we know of the fate of Hophra (Apries) is derived from Herodotus (2:169), who states that Amssis "gave Apries over into the hands of his former subjects, to deal with as they chose. Then the Egyptians took him and strangled him" (see further on Jeremiah 46:13). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;
