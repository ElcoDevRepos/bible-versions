In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>, the prophet is delivering a message of judgment against Moab, a nation that had often been in conflict with Israel. The "work of the LORD" here refers to carrying out God's judgment against Moab. Historically, the Israelites were often used as instruments of divine justice, and failing to fulfill this role was seen as disobedience. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>, where Saul's incomplete obedience leads to his rejection as king. The idea of being "cursed" for neglecting God's work underscores the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>and cursed is he who withholds his sword from bloodshed</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the necessity of executing divine judgment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, warfare was often seen as a means of enacting divine will. The "sword" symbolizes the instrument of God's justice, and withholding it implies a failure to carry out God's commands. This is reminiscent of the command given to Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a> to completely destroy the Amalekites, which he failed to do, resulting in God's displeasure. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who will execute perfect justice at His second coming (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>). The imagery of the sword is also used in the New Testament to describe the Word of God (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>), indicating the power and authority of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of Judah and surrounding nations, including Moab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation east of Israel, often in conflict with the Israelites. <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a> is a prophecy against Moab, pronouncing judgment for their pride and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_work.htm">The LORD's Work</a></b><br>Refers to the tasks and commands given by God, which in this context involves executing judgment against Moab.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sword.htm">Sword</a></b><br>Symbolizes the instrument of God's judgment.

The &#8220;work of the LORD&#8221; in this chapter is the divinely commanded campaign that Babylon will carry out against Moab. Failing to obey that commission invites a curse.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently warns against half-hearted service: Saul lost his kingdom for incomplete obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-18.htm">1 Samuel 15:18-23</a>). Jesus calls such lukewarmness &#8220;worthless&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>). Paul urges, &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The curse reminds believers that God&#8217;s assignments&#8212;whether proclaiming the gospel (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) or bearing daily witness (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>)&#8212;are never optional.

Refusing to swing the sword would mean opposing God&#8217;s justice. Similar warnings appear when Israel was told, &#8220;Do not be discouraged, for the battle is not yours but God&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>), and when a prophet condemned a soldier who spared Ben-hadad (<a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35-42</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle: when God authorizes judgment, withholding action is disobedience. <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> affirms the governing sword &#8220;is God&#8217;s servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In a spiritual sense, believers today wield &#8220;the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>). Shrinking from declaring truth that cuts convictingly is akin to sheathing the sword God provided (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). Silence in the face of sin is not neutrality; it is rebellion (<a href="/ezekiel/3-18.htm">Ezekiel 3:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/48-10.htm">Jeremiah 48:10</a>: &#8220;Cursed is the one who is remiss in doing the work of the LORD, and cursed is he who withholds his sword from bloodshed.&#8221; The verse binds together two ideas: wholehearted obedience and courageous execution of God&#8217;s appointed tasks.

The thought rests on the belief in the Divine government that works through war as well as through pestilence and famine (<a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm" title="A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD has a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 25:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm" title="For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.">Jeremiah 46:10</a>).
