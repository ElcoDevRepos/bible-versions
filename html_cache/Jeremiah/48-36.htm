The flute, often used in funerals and lamentations in ancient cultures, symbolizes the profound grief God feels for Moab. Moab was a nation east of Israel, often in conflict with Israel, yet God expresses compassion for them. This reflects God's character as one who grieves over judgment, even for those who oppose His people. The lamentation is a response to Moab's impending destruction, as prophesied earlier in the chapter.<p><b>it laments like a flute for the men of Kir-heres,</b><br>Kir-heres, also known as Kir-hareseth, was a significant city in Moab. The repetition of the flute imagery emphasizes the intensity of the lament. Kir-heres was a fortified city, indicating that even the strongholds of Moab would not escape judgment. This highlights the totality of the coming devastation. The lament for Kir-heres underscores the personal and communal loss that the Moabites would experience.<p><b>because the wealth they acquired has perished.</b><br>The wealth of Moab, likely accumulated through trade and agriculture, is now gone. This loss signifies not just economic ruin but also the collapse of their societal structure and security. In biblical terms, wealth often symbolizes self-reliance and pride, which can lead to a nation's downfall when it turns away from God. The perishing of wealth serves as a reminder of the transient nature of material possessions and the ultimate sovereignty of God over nations. This connects to the broader biblical theme that true security and prosperity come from reliance on God, not on earthly riches.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah and surrounding nations, including Moab.

Because Moab has persisted in pride and idolatry, the Lord now speaks of inevitable ruin.<p>&#8226; Yet the verse opens not with anger but with grief. The Lord says, &#8220;My heart laments like a flute,&#8221; evoking the mournful pipes played at funerals (<a href="/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>). The sound is piercing, lingering, impossible to ignore&#8212;just like divine sorrow over sin.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice and compassion appear side by side. He must judge (<a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a>), but He also &#8220;takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). <a href="/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a> mirrors the same heartbeat: &#8220;My inner being moans like a harp for Moab.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The picture invites us to feel what the Lord feels: righteous grief when people He created reap the consequences of rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it laments like a flute for the men of Kir-heres</b><p>&#8226; The lament is repeated and narrowed. Kir-heres (also called Kir-hareseth) was Moab&#8217;s chief fortress (<a href="/2_kings/3-25.htm">2 Kings 3:25</a>). By naming the city, the text personalizes the sorrow&#8212;each resident matters to God.<p>&#8226; The duplication &#8220;laments like a flute&#8221; doubles the intensity, forming a dirge that rolls through the streets much like the hired mourners in <a href="/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17-18</a>.<p>&#8226; No stronghold can outmuscle divine judgment (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>). The very town Moab trusted becomes a site of wailing (<a href="/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s heartache over a specific place reminds us that His dealings are never coldly mechanical; He knows every face behind the walls (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the wealth they acquired has perished</b><p>&#8226; Here is the reason for the funeral song: Moab&#8217;s treasure is gone. Earlier the prophet warned, &#8220;Because you trust in your works and your treasures, you also will be captured&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Riches cannot rescue in the day of wrath (<a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>). They sprout wings (<a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>), lie rotting in the streets (<a href="/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>), and testify against their owners (<a href="/james/5-1.htm">James 5:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Moab&#8217;s economy and pride were intertwined (<a href="/jeremiah/48-29.htm">Jeremiah 48:29</a>). When the Lord topples one, the other collapses. The resulting poverty fuels the lament, just as material loss will dominate the sorrow of Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11-17</a>.<p>&#8226; The verse presses home a timeless warning: any security built on possessions instead of the Lord will sooner or later &#8220;perish&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-17.htm">1 John 2:17</a>; <a href="/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a> paints a funeral scene composed by God Himself. He announces judgment on Moab, yet His own heart plays the dirge. The double mention of the flute underscores deep, personal grief&#8212;first for the nation as a whole, then for its proud stronghold. The cause of the mourning is clear: the wealth in which Moab trusted has vanished. Together these lines reveal a God who is perfectly just, profoundly compassionate, and determined to expose the emptiness of material security so that people might turn to Him, the only lasting refuge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes . . .</span>--The words reproduce <a href="/isaiah/16-11.htm" title="Why my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh.">Isaiah 16:11</a>.
