The "wound" symbolizes the deep-seated sin and rebellion against God. The leaders' attempts to address these issues are compared to a careless dressing of a wound, indicating a lack of genuine concern or effective action. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God condemns leaders who fail to shepherd His people properly (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>). The imagery of a wound suggests a need for healing that only God can provide, pointing to the ultimate healing through Christ (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p><b>saying, &#8216;Peace, peace,&#8217;</b><br>The repetition of "peace" emphasizes the false assurances given by the leaders and prophets. In the historical context, this was a time of impending judgment and destruction due to the Babylonian threat. The leaders' declarations of peace were misleading, as they ignored the reality of the situation and the need for repentance. This false sense of security is a recurring theme in Scripture, where people are warned against those who proclaim peace when there is none (<a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>). It serves as a caution against complacency and the danger of ignoring God's warnings.<p><b>when there is no peace at all</b><br>This phrase underscores the stark contrast between the leaders' declarations and the actual state of affairs. The absence of peace is both a physical reality, with the threat of invasion, and a spiritual reality, with the people's estrangement from God. Theologically, true peace is found only in reconciliation with God, which the leaders failed to facilitate. This anticipates the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), who offers genuine peace through His sacrifice (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).
