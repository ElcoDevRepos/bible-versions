The "word of the LORD" signifies divine communication, a common prophetic introduction indicating that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. The address to "kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem" highlights the scope of the prophecy, targeting both the leadership and the general populace. Historically, this period was marked by political instability and idolatry, with kings often leading the nation away from covenantal faithfulness. The call to "hear" underscores the importance of listening and responding to God's warnings, a recurring theme in prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>).<p><b>This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" (Yahweh Sabaoth) conveys God's supreme power and command over heavenly armies, emphasizing His ability to execute judgment. "The God of Israel" reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and His people, reminding them of their unique identity and obligations. This dual title underscores both God's authority and His personal relationship with Israel, setting the stage for the gravity of the forthcoming message. It also serves as a reminder of past deliverances and the expectations of covenant faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>).<p><b>I am going to bring such disaster on this place</b><br>The phrase "such disaster" indicates a severe judgment, reflecting the consequences of persistent disobedience and idolatry. "This place" refers to Jerusalem and its environs, the center of religious and political life in Judah. The impending disaster is a fulfillment of covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>, where disobedience leads to national calamity. This prophecy foreshadows the Babylonian invasion and the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, a pivotal event in Jewish history.<p><b>that the ears of all who hear of it will ring,</b><br>This vivid imagery suggests a shocking and unforgettable event, one that will reverberate beyond Judah to surrounding nations. The phrase "ears...will ring" implies a reaction of astonishment and horror, indicating the magnitude of the disaster. This serves as a warning to other nations about the seriousness of defying God, reinforcing the universal scope of His sovereignty. The ringing ears symbolize the far-reaching impact of God's judgment, echoing similar expressions of astonishment found in <a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a> and <a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
