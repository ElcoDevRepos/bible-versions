The phrase underscores the authority and responsibility of the prophet to communicate divine revelation, regardless of its content. This mirrors the role of prophets throughout the Old Testament, such as Isaiah and Ezekiel, who were also tasked with delivering difficult messages to God's people.<p><b>My eyes overflow with tears;</b><br>This expression of deep sorrow and lamentation reflects God's compassion and grief over the impending judgment on Judah. It highlights the emotional aspect of God's relationship with His people, showing that divine justice is not devoid of divine empathy. This imagery is reminiscent of Jesus weeping over Jerusalem in <a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>, illustrating a continuity of God's heart for His people.<p><b>day and night they do not cease,</b><br>The unceasing nature of the tears signifies the relentless and overwhelming nature of the coming judgment. It also reflects the continuous intercession and mourning that Jeremiah, as a prophet, experiences on behalf of the people. This can be connected to the concept of persistent prayer and intercession found in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>, where believers are encouraged to "pray without ceasing."<p><b>for the virgin daughter of my people</b><br>The term "virgin daughter" is a poetic expression used to describe the nation of Judah, emphasizing purity and the special relationship between God and His people. It conveys a sense of innocence lost and the tragedy of impending destruction. This imagery is used elsewhere in the prophets, such as in <a href="/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>, to denote the beloved status of Jerusalem and Judah.<p><b>has been shattered by a crushing blow,</b><br>This phrase indicates the severity of the judgment that has befallen Judah, likened to a devastating and irreversible blow. It reflects the consequences of the nation's persistent sin and rebellion against God. The imagery of a "crushing blow" is often used in prophetic literature to describe divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>.<p><b>a severely grievous wound.</b><br>The description of the wound as "severely grievous" underscores the depth of the nation's suffering and the seriousness of their spiritual condition. It suggests a wound that is not easily healed, pointing to the need for repentance and divine intervention. This can be seen as a type of the ultimate healing that comes through Christ, who bore our wounds and transgressions, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
