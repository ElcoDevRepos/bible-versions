In ancient times, couriers were used to relay messages quickly across distances, often on horseback. The imagery here suggests a breakdown in communication and control, as multiple messengers are needed to convey the dire news. This can be compared to the fall of other great cities in the Bible, such as Nineveh, where swift destruction was also prophesied (<a href="/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4-5</a>).<p><b>and messenger follows messenger</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the overwhelming nature of the news being delivered. In the context of ancient warfare, multiple messengers would indicate a significant event, such as a military defeat or a city being overrun. This aligns with the historical context of Babylon's fall to the Medes and Persians in 539 BC, as recorded in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>. The continuous flow of messengers underscores the inevitability of God's judgment against Babylon.<p><b>to announce to the king of Babylon</b><br>The king of Babylon at the time of its fall was Belshazzar, as mentioned in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>. This phrase highlights the humiliation and surprise of the Babylonian leadership, who were confident in their city's defenses. The announcement to the king signifies the fulfillment of God's prophecy against Babylon, as foretold by Jeremiah and other prophets (<a href="/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47:1-5</a>).<p><b>that his city has been captured</b><br>Babylon, once a symbol of human pride and achievement, is now described as captured. This fulfills the prophetic declarations against Babylon for its idolatry and oppression of God's people (<a href="/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2-3</a>). The capture of Babylon serves as a reminder of the sovereignty of God over nations and His ability to bring down even the mightiest empires.<p><b>from end to end</b><br>This phrase indicates total conquest, with no part of the city left untouched. Babylon was known for its extensive walls and fortifications, yet its complete capture demonstrates the futility of relying on human strength against divine judgment. This totality is echoed in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon is used as a symbol of worldly power and is prophesied to fall completely in the end times.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah and surrounding nations, including Babylon.
