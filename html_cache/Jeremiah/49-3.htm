The call to wail indicates impending doom and destruction, a common prophetic motif. Ai, another city, symbolizes defeat and judgment, reminiscent of its earlier destruction in Joshua's conquest (Joshua 8). This phrase underscores the certainty of divine judgment against nations opposing God's people.<p><b>cry out, O daughters of Rabbah!</b><br>Rabbah was the capital of the Ammonites, and "daughters" refers to its inhabitants, emphasizing their vulnerability. The call to cry out signifies distress and impending calamity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's judgment on nations for their sins, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>Put on sackcloth and mourn;</b><br>Sackcloth was a coarse material worn as a sign of mourning and repentance. This phrase calls for a public display of grief, acknowledging the severity of the situation. The act of mourning is a response to divine judgment, seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the story of Nineveh's repentance in <a href="/jonah/3.htm">Jonah 3</a>.<p><b>run back and forth within your walls,</b><br>This imagery suggests panic and chaos within the city, highlighting the futility of seeking refuge in human defenses. It reflects the broader biblical theme that security is found in God alone, not in physical fortifications or human strength, as echoed in Psalms and Proverbs.<p><b>for Milcom will go into exile together with his priests and officials.</b><br>Milcom, also known as Molech, was the chief deity of the Ammonites. The exile of Milcom signifies the impotence of false gods before the true God. The mention of priests and officials indicates the complete overthrow of the religious and political structures. This echoes the biblical theme of God's supremacy over all false idols, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus) and the fall of Babylon (Revelation).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>A significant city in ancient Moab, often associated with the Amorites and later the Israelites.

Heshbon sits on the northern plateau once controlled by Moab, now under Ammonite influence. God calls its people to lament because a neighboring stronghold&#8212;Ai&#8212;has already fallen, proving that Babylon&#8217;s advance is real and unstoppable.<p>&#8226; The grief mirrors earlier warnings against Moab (<a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>) and Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah pictured the same cry rising from Heshbon when judgment swept over Moab (<a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The fall of one fortified city is a signpost for the rest: what happened to Ai is about to happen to you (cf. <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2&#8211;5</a> for an earlier Ai, underscoring that no town is too small or too well-known to escape judgment).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>cry out, O daughters of Rabbah!</b><p>&#8220;cry out, O daughters of Rabbah!&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>b).

The verse affirms that the LORD alone is sovereign over nations, cities, and deities.

In <a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a> and Isaiah 16:9 it is reckoned to the Moabites. There was a continual warfare between the neigh-bouring tribes of Reuben and Gad on the one hand, and the Moabites and Ammonites on the other. Let Heshbon lament, because <span class="cmt_word">Ai is spoiled</span>. The introduction of At, which is only known to us as a Canaanitish town, near Bethel, on the wrong side of the Jordan for Moab, is startling. It is replied that we have no list of the Ammonitish cities, and that there may have been another town named At. The reply is valid; but loaves a second difficulty untouched, viz. that the mention of a third place destroys the continuity of thought. First, we are made acquainted with the fall of Rabbah; then Heshbon (probably the second place in the country) is called upon to wail because <span class="accented">x</span> has been taken by storm; then the populations of the "daughter" cities are summoned to join in the lamentation over Rabbah; - is it not reasonable to conclude that the subject of the mourning is one and the same? Now, it is well known that the received text abounds in small errors arising from the confusion of similar Hebrew letters, and that among the letters most easily confounded are <span class="accented">yod</span> and <span class="accented">resh.</span> Is it not an obvious conclusion that for Ai we should rather read Ar ("the city"), a name as suitable for the capital of Ammon as for that of Moab? It is true that we have no example elsewhere of Rabbah being called by the name of Ar; but in <a href="/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3, 14</a> it is described as "the city," and we have to be on our guard against the argument <span class="accented">a silentio</span> - that favourite weapon of destructive criticism!
