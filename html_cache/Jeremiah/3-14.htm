The term "faithless children" highlights Israel's unfaithfulness, akin to a wayward spouse, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This imagery is consistent with the broader biblical narrative where God is portrayed as a faithful husband to His people (<a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>).<p><b>declares the LORD,</b><br>The phrase underscores the authority and sovereignty of God. It is a divine proclamation, emphasizing that the message is not from the prophet's own mind but from God Himself. This is a common prophetic formula, reinforcing the seriousness and authenticity of the message.<p><b>for I am your master,</b><br>The Hebrew word used here can also mean "husband," reinforcing the covenantal relationship. This reflects the cultural context of ancient Israel, where marriage was a binding covenant, symbolizing God's commitment to His people. It also points to the New Testament understanding of Christ as the bridegroom (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p><b>and I will take you&#8212;one from a city and two from a family&#8212;</b><br>This phrase suggests a selective gathering, indicating that not all will respond to the call to return. It reflects the remnant theology found throughout the Bible, where a faithful few are preserved (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). The numbers "one" and "two" signify a small, faithful remnant, emphasizing the personal nature of God's call.<p><b>and bring you to Zion.</b><br>Zion is a significant biblical location, often symbolizing the presence of God and the ultimate place of restoration and peace. In the historical context, Zion refers to Jerusalem, the center of worship and the Davidic kingdom. Prophetically, it points to the eschatological hope of a restored relationship with God, fulfilled in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>). This promise of return to Zion is a type of the ultimate gathering of God's people through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who calls His people to return to Him despite their unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/faithless_children.htm">Faithless Children</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel who have turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and breaking the covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A term often used to refer to Jerusalem, symbolizing the spiritual center and the place of God's presence and blessing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, known for his role in calling Israel to repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel's_apostasy.htm">Israel's Apostasy</a></b><br>The event of Israel turning away from God, which is the context for this call to return.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unfailing_love.htm">God's Unfailing Love</a></b><br>Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God remains committed to His people, demonstrating His steadfast love and desire for their return.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The call to "return" is a call to repentance, a turning away from sin and back to God, which is essential for spiritual restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/individual_responsibility.htm">Individual Responsibility</a></b><br>The phrase "one from a city and two from a family" highlights that returning to God is a personal decision, not just a corporate one.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_master.htm">God as Master</a></b><br>Recognizing God as "Master" implies submission to His authority and acknowledgment of His rightful place in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/promise_of_restoration.htm">Promise of Restoration</a></b><br>God's promise to bring His people to Zion signifies not just physical return but spiritual renewal and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_3_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 3:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_3_14_God_s_call_for_faithfulness.htm">How does Jeremiah 3:14 illustrate God's desire for a faithful relationship with us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_authority_love_in_I_am_your_Master.htm">What does "I am your Master" reveal about God's authority and love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_use_return_in_daily_repentance.htm">How can we apply the call to "return" in our daily repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Jer_3_14_to_Prodigal_Son_parable.htm">Connect Jeremiah 3:14 with the parable of the Prodigal Son in Luke.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_s_promise_inspire_hope.htm">How does God's promise to "bring you to Zion" inspire hope in believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_3_14_on_God_s_bond_with_Israel.htm">What does Jeremiah 3:14 reveal about God's relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_3_14_God_s_call_to_repent.htm">How does Jeremiah 3:14 illustrate God's call for repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_God_called_husband_in_Jer_3_14.htm">Why does God refer to Himself as a "husband" in Jeremiah 3:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_were_babies_killed_in_the_flood.htm">Does God actively seek a relationship with us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_backsliding.htm">What does the Bible say about backsliding?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_christian_wedding.htm">What defines a Christian wedding ceremony?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'betroth_you_forever'_mean.htm">What does "I will betroth you to me forever" mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Jeremiah 3:14 Mean</div><b>Return, O faithless children</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s opening word is a loving call, not a harsh dismissal.

There is a play upon words, or rather upon senses, in the original, "Turn, ye turned away ones" (comp. ver. 12). To whom is this addressed? To the Israelites in the narrower sense, for there is nothing to indicate a transition. Long as they have been removed from the paternal hearth, they are still "sons." <span class="cmt_word">For I am married unto you</span>. The same Hebrew phrase occurs in <a href="/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>. Its signification has been a subject of dispute. From the supposed necessities of exegesis in <a href="/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>, some (e.g. Pococke and Gesenins) have translated, "for I have rejected you," but the connection requires not "for" but "though," which, however, is an inadmissible rendering; besides, the Hebrew verb in question nowhere has the sense of "reject" elsewhere (yet the Septuagint already has it, virtually at least, in <a href="/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>, q.v.). The literal meaning is <span class="accented">for I have been a lord over you</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a husband. Israel is despondent, and fears to return. Jehovah repeats his invitation, assuring Israel that he does not regard the marriage bond as broken. He is still (in spite of ver. 8) the husband, and Israel the bride (comp. <a href="/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">One of a city, and two of a family</span>. The promises of God are primarily to communities, but this does not prevent him from devoting the most special care to individuals. "One of a city, and two of a family," even though there should be but one faithful Lot in a city, and two such in a family (larger than a city, a single tribe containing only a few <span class="accented">mishpa-khoth</span>, or clans), yet I will admit these few to the promised blessings." Calvin's remark is worth noticing: "Hie locus dignus est observatu, quia ostendit Deus non esse, cur alii alios expectent; deinde etiam si corpus ipsum populi putreseat in suis peccatis, tamen si pauci ad ipsum redeant, se illis etiam fore placabilem." The historical facts to which the prophecy corresponds are variously regarded. Theodoret, Grotius, etc., suppose it to have been fulfilled exclusively in the return from Babylon; St. Jerome and others think rather of the Messianic period. Hengstenberg finds a continuous fulfillment, beginning at the time of Cyrus, when many belonging to the ten tribes joined themselves to the returning Judahites. He finds a further continuation in the times of the Maccabees, and in fact a continually growing fulfillment in preparation for that complete one brought in by Christ, when the premised blessings were poured out upon the whole <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>). "Zion and the holy land were at that time the seat of the kingdom of God, so that the return to the latter was inseparable from the return to the former." Dr. Guthe, however, the latest critical commentator on Jeremiah, thinks that the passage can be explained otherwise, viz." from each city one by one, and from each family two by two." This gives a more obvious explanation; but the ordinary rendering is more natural, and the explanation based upon it is in the highest degree worthy of the Divine subject. The doubt, of course, is whether in the Old Testament a special providence is extended elsewhere so distinctly to the individual. But Jeremiah is pre-eminently an individualizing prophet; he feels the depth and reality of individual as opposed to corporate life as no one else among the prophets. (At any rate, one point is clear, that the prophet foresees that the number of the exiles who return will be but small compared with the increase to be divinely vouchsafed to them; see ver. 16.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Return,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O faithless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7726.htm">Strong's 7726: </a> </span><span class="str2">Turning back, recusant, apostate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">children,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">am your master,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8216;al&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1166.htm">Strong's 1166: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be master, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and I will take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;qa&#7717;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
