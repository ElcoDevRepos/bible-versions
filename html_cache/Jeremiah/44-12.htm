The "remnant" often signifies those who remain faithful to God, but in this context, it highlights those who have physically survived. Theologically, the concept of a remnant is significant throughout the Bible, symbolizing hope and continuity of God's promises despite judgment.<p><b>who have resolved to go to the land of Egypt to reside there</b><br>The decision to flee to Egypt was against God's explicit command through Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19</a>). Egypt, historically a place of bondage for the Israelites, represents a return to reliance on human strength and foreign powers rather than trusting in God. This decision reflects a lack of faith and disobedience, reminiscent of Israel's past failures.<p><b>they will meet their end</b><br>This phrase indicates the certainty of judgment. Theologically, it underscores the principle that disobedience to God leads to destruction. Historically, the Judeans' reliance on Egypt for safety was misplaced, as Egypt itself was under threat from Babylonian expansion.<p><b>They will all fall by the sword or be consumed by famine</b><br>The dual mention of "sword" and "famine" emphasizes the completeness of the impending judgment. These are common forms of divine judgment in the Old Testament, often used to demonstrate God's sovereignty and the consequences of sin. This echoes earlier warnings given by prophets like Ezekiel and Isaiah.<p><b>From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine</b><br>This phrase highlights the impartiality of God's judgment. Social status or wealth will not protect anyone from the consequences of disobedience. It reflects the biblical theme that all are equal before God, and His justice applies universally.<p><b>and they will become an object of cursing and horror, of vilification and reproach</b><br>The outcome of their disobedience will serve as a warning to others. This phrase suggests that their fate will be so severe that it will become proverbial, a cautionary tale for future generations. It connects to the broader biblical narrative where Israel's failures serve as lessons for the faithful, emphasizing the importance of obedience and trust in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/remnant_of_judah.htm">Remnant of Judah</a></b><br>The remaining people of Judah who survived the Babylonian conquest and chose to flee to Egypt against God's command.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the remnant of Judah sought refuge, symbolizing disobedience and reliance on human strength rather than God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's message of judgment to the people of Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sword_and_famine.htm">Sword and Famine</a></b><br>Instruments of God's judgment, representing the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cursing_and_horror.htm">Cursing and Horror</a></b><br>The outcome of Judah's disobedience, serving as a warning to others.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God&#8217;s Commands</a></b><br>The remnant's decision to go to Egypt was a direct act of disobedience.
