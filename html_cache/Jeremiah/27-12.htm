Zedekiah's reign (597-586 BC) was marked by political instability and pressure from surrounding nations. Jeremiah's message to Zedekiah is consistent with his previous prophecies, emphasizing submission to Babylon as God's will. This reflects the broader theme of divine sovereignty and the consequences of disobedience. Zedekiah's reluctance to heed Jeremiah's warnings ultimately led to the fall of Jerusalem, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>.<p><b>Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon:</b><br>The imagery of a yoke symbolizes submission and servitude. In ancient agrarian societies, a yoke was used to control oxen, signifying control and burden. Jeremiah uses this metaphor to convey God's command for Judah to submit to Babylonian rule. This submission is not merely political but a divine directive, as Babylon is portrayed as an instrument of God's judgment. The yoke also foreshadows the coming exile, a period of purification and eventual restoration for Israel.<p><b>serve him and his people, and live!:</b><br>Jeremiah's message is clear: survival depends on obedience to God's command to serve Babylon. This directive challenges the nationalistic and rebellious sentiments of Judah's leaders and people. The call to "serve" highlights a theme of humility and repentance, urging Judah to accept God's discipline. The promise of life contrasts with the destruction that rebellion would bring, emphasizing God's desire for His people's preservation even in judgment. This echoes the broader biblical narrative of life through obedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

God&#8217;s word is unchanging whether it is delivered to commoners, foreign kings, or Judah&#8217;s own ruler (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). Zedekiah&#8217;s throne exists only because Nebuchadnezzar placed him there after taking Jehoiachin captive (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>); Jeremiah reminds him that the LORD, not political maneuvering, controls that arrangement (<a href="/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5-7</a>). This consistency underscores a timeless truth&#8212;when God speaks, He expects every listener to respond in humble obedience (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon</b><p>Earlier in the chapter Jeremiah literally wears a wooden yoke to dramatize God&#8217;s decree (<a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>). The image is not poetic license; it is a call to literal submission to Babylon&#8217;s rule. Scripture often portrays a yoke as servitude (<a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>) or discipline (<a href="/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a>). Here it is both: God disciplines Judah for covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47-48</a>) by placing the nation under Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s authority (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). Refusing that yoke would be fighting against the LORD Himself (<a href="/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a>; 28:14). The principle echoes <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>&#8212;earthly authorities exist by God&#8217;s appointment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Serve him and his people</b><p>Submission is more than passive resignation. God instructs Judah actively to &#8220;serve&#8221; the Babylonian administration, echoing His later letter to the exiles: &#8220;seek the peace of the city&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>). Daniel and his friends model this service: they work faithfully within Babylonian structures while staying loyal to God (<a href="/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17-20</a>; 2:48-49). By serving Nebuchadnezzar, Judah becomes a witness to the true King&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>). Obedient service under pagan authority does not compromise faith; it demonstrates trust that God can advance His purposes through unlikely rulers (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And live!</b><p>The command carries a gracious promise. Compliance would spare the nation from sword, famine, and pestilence (<a href="/jeremiah/27-13.htm">Jeremiah 27:13, 17</a>). In practical terms, surrender meant survival, just as earlier the people were offered life if they went out to the Chaldeans (<a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; 38:2). God&#8217;s discipline is always aimed at restoration, not destruction (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>). Even in judgment, He sets before His people the choice of life or death (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>). Those who trust His word enough to obey will find His mercies new every morning (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a> calls Judah&#8217;s king&#8212;and by extension the nation&#8212;to accept God-ordained discipline by submitting to Babylon. The yoke is literal and timely, yet it teaches an enduring lesson: life and blessing flow from humble obedience to the LORD, even when He works through uncomfortable or hostile authorities. Choosing submission over resistance is choosing life, because it aligns the believer with God&#8217;s sovereign plan and opens the door for His mercy to prevail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">I spake also to Zedekiah . . .</span>--There was, as we see in <a href="/jeremiah/28-13.htm" title="Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus said the LORD; You have broken the yokes of wood; but you shall make for them yokes of iron.">Jeremiah 28:13</a>, a party of resistance in Judah also, and they, too, were trusting in delusive prophecies of the overthrow of the Chaldaean monarchy.
