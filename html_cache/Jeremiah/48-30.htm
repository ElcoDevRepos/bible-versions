In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>, God is speaking about Moab, a nation often in conflict with Israel. The term "insolence" refers to Moab's pride and self-reliance, which is condemned throughout the Bible (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). God's declaration emphasizes His authority and the certainty of His judgment. The LORD's knowledge of Moab's arrogance is a reminder of His intimate understanding of all nations and individuals, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>.<p><b>but it is futile.</b><br>The futility of Moab's pride is underscored here. Despite their confidence and self-exaltation, their efforts are ultimately in vain against God's sovereign will. This reflects the biblical theme that human pride leads to downfall (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11-12</a>). The futility of opposing God is a recurring message in Scripture, as seen in the story of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where human pride is thwarted by divine intervention.<p><b>His boasting is as empty as his deeds.</b><br>This phrase connects Moab's verbal arrogance with their actions, both of which are deemed worthless. The emptiness of their boasting is a critique of their false security and reliance on their own strength rather than on God. This mirrors the biblical principle that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>), and that actions not rooted in righteousness are ultimately meaningless. The emptiness of Moab's deeds can be compared to the Pharisees' outward religiosity without true devotion (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of Judah and surrounding nations, including Moab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

The Lord sees every heart motive (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>), hears every arrogant word (<a href="/psalms/94-11.htm">Psalm 94:11</a>), and knows the end from the beginning (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9&#8211;10</a>). Moab&#8217;s swagger is not hidden from Him. Pride always precedes a fall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), and God stands opposed to the proud while giving grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). By stating &#8220;I know,&#8221; He exposes the self-deception that tries to mask sin behind bravado (<a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>This phrase anchors the statement in divine authority. When God &#8220;declares,&#8221; the matter is settled (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). His word never returns void (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>), and He watches over it to perform it (<a href="/jeremiah/1-12.htm">Jeremiah 1:12</a>). The people of Moab may doubt, but heaven&#8217;s decree does not wobble with human opinion. The same certainty backs every promise and warning in Scripture (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but it is futile</b><p>Pride and rebellion never produce lasting results. God nullifies the counsel of nations and frustrates the plans of peoples (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a>). For Moab, all the plotting, military posturing, and idol worship will collapse like a house of cards (<a href="/jeremiah/48-42.htm">Jeremiah 48:42</a>). Futility is the inevitable outcome when finite creatures oppose the Infinite One (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His boasting is as empty as his deeds</b><p>Moab&#8217;s loud claims cannot hide hollow actions.<p>&#8226; Words without substance: They echo the empty bragging condemned in <a href="/james/4-16.htm">James 4:16</a> and <a href="/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a>.<p>&#8226; Deeds without righteousness: Outward activity lacks true obedience (<a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Coming exposure: When God judges, both the talk and the walk are weighed (<a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). For believers today, this warns against any form of lip-service faith that is not matched by Spirit-empowered living (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/48-30.htm">Jeremiah 48:30</a> reveals that God fully knows Moab&#8217;s arrogant heart, speaks with unquestionable authority, exposes the ultimate uselessness of pride, and judges empty boasting that is unsupported by righteous deeds. The verse calls us to humble dependence on the Lord, sincere obedience, and confidence that His declarations always stand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">His lies shall not so effect it.</span>--The Hebrew for "lies" has also, as in the margin, the meaning of "bars" or "staves" or "branches" as the symbol of defence (<a href="/hosea/11-6.htm" title="And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.">Hosea 11:6</a>), but the version in the text is preferable. The emphasis of the original lies in the iteration. "Not so," the sentence of frustration, is written alike on the wrath which leads to passionate outrage, and on the lies in which it seeks to find safety.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it shall not be so,</span> etc. This is a case in which the accentuation must most decidedly be deviated from; it implies a faulty view of the word rendered in the Authorized Version, "his lies." But the rendering of our version is neither in itself tenable nor is it that intended by the accentuation. The rendering suggested by the latter is "his praters" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> soothsayers), as the word, no doubt, must be taken in Jeremiah 1:36; <a href="/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>. But it is much more natural to render thus: "And the untruth of his pratings [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of his boastings]; the untruth that they have wrought." In his words and in his works (and a word is equal to a work before the Divine Judge) Mesh was essentially "untrue." Truth, in the Biblical sense, is to know and serve the true God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/48-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1433;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his fury,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#7687;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
