The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God's command over the heavenly armies, underscoring His power and majesty. This introduction is common in prophetic literature, indicating the seriousness and divine origin of the message (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, <a href="/amos/3-13.htm">Amos 3:13</a>).<p><b>Take note,</b><br>This call to attention is a directive for the people to listen carefully and consider the gravity of the situation.

In the context of Jeremiah, it is a call to heed the warnings of impending judgment due to the people's unfaithfulness.<p><b>and summon the wailing women;</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern cultures, professional mourners were often employed to lament at funerals and other times of communal grief. These women were skilled in expressing sorrow and leading others in mourning. The summoning of wailing women signifies the depth of the impending disaster and the need for public lamentation. This practice is also seen in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>, where Jeremiah himself laments for Josiah.<p><b>send for the most skillful among them.</b><br>The emphasis on skillful mourners highlights the severity of the situation. It suggests that ordinary expressions of grief are insufficient for the calamity that is to come. The use of skilled mourners indicates a formal and intense period of mourning, reflecting the cultural practices of the time. This also serves as a metaphor for the depth of Israel's spiritual and moral decay, requiring an expert response to the profound loss they are about to experience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.
