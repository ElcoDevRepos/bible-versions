Moab's reputation for arrogance was well-known among neighboring nations. This phrase indicates that Moab's pride was not just a local issue but had reached the ears of others, including the Israelites. Historically, Moab was a wealthy nation due to its strategic location and fertile lands, which may have contributed to its sense of superiority.<p><b>his exceeding pride and conceit</b><br>Moab's pride is described as "exceeding," suggesting it was beyond normal arrogance. This pride is often linked to their reliance on their own strength and resources rather than acknowledging God. In biblical terms, pride is frequently condemned as it leads to a false sense of security and self-reliance, which ultimately results in downfall. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that "pride goes before destruction," a principle that applies to Moab's fate.<p><b>his proud arrogance</b><br>The repetition of terms related to pride emphasizes the depth of Moab's sin. Arrogance in the Bible is often associated with a refusal to submit to God's authority. Moab's arrogance can be seen in their historical interactions with Israel, where they often opposed God's people. This attitude is reminiscent of other nations judged by God for their pride, such as Babylon and Assyria.<p><b>and haughtiness of heart</b><br>The "haughtiness of heart" suggests an internalized pride that affects one's entire being. In biblical literature, the heart is the center of one's will and emotions. Moab's haughtiness indicates a deep-seated rebellion against God. This internal pride is contrasted with the humility that God desires, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for justice, mercy, and humility before God. Moab's haughtiness ultimately leads to their judgment, as prophesied in the surrounding verses of <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.
