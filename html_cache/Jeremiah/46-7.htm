In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46</a>, it refers to the Egyptian army, which is being compared to a powerful natural force. The question sets the stage for a description of Egypt's military might and impending downfall. This style of questioning is reminiscent of other prophetic books, such as Isaiah and Ezekiel, where nations are often personified and questioned about their actions and fate.<p><b>rising like the Nile</b><br>The Nile River is central to Egypt's identity, economy, and agriculture. Its annual flooding was a symbol of life and prosperity, providing fertile soil for crops. By comparing the Egyptian army to the rising Nile, the text emphasizes their strength and potential to overwhelm. However, this imagery also foreshadows their eventual defeat, as the Nile's rise is predictable and controlled by God, suggesting that Egypt's power is ultimately under divine authority. This metaphor is echoed in other scriptures where natural phenomena are used to describe the rise and fall of nations, such as in <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>.<p><b>like rivers whose waters churn</b><br>The churning waters symbolize chaos and tumult, reflecting the disorder and destruction that Egypt's army will bring. However, this imagery also hints at the instability and unpredictability of Egypt's power. In the ancient Near East, rivers were often seen as both life-giving and destructive, capable of nourishing the land or causing devastation through floods. This duality is present in the prophecy, as Egypt's might is both formidable and ultimately doomed to fail. The churning waters can also be seen as a type of the judgment that God brings upon nations, as seen in the flood narrative of Genesis and the Red Sea crossing in Exodus, where waters are instruments of divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.

The nation sees its army as a majestic, unstoppable river, but the Lord&#8217;s question unmasks that illusion. Just as swiftly as the Nile rises and churns, so will Egypt be swept away by divine judgment. The verse reminds us that no earthly power&#8212;however confident&#8212;can stand against the sovereign, living God who rules both rivers and nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7, 8) <span class= "bld">Who is this that cometh up as a flood? . . .</span>--The Hebrew word for "flood" is used as a proper name almost exclusively (<a href="/context/daniel/12-5.htm" title="Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.">Daniel 12:5-6</a> being the only exception) for the Nile (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/context/genesis/41-1.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.">Genesis 41:1-3</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-3.htm" title="And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.">Exodus 2:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land: and the water which you take out of the river shall become blood on the dry land.">Exodus 4:9</a>; <a href="/amos/8-8.htm" title="Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwells therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.">Amos 8:8</a>; <a href="/amos/9-5.htm" title="And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that touches the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.">Amos 9:5</a>), and thus the very form of the question points to the answer that follows. The prophet goes back, as an English poet might have done after the destruction of the Spanish Armada, to the time when all the strength of Egypt had been poured forth in the exultation of anticipated victory, as the great river of Egypt poured its waters. The word for "rivers," though more general, has a like allusive reference, being used in <a href="/exodus/7-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.">Exodus 7:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-5.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:5</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-14.htm" title="Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 32:14</a> for the arms or canals of the Nile. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is this,</span> etc.?
