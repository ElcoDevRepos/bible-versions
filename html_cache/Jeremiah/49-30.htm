Escape quickly!</b><br>This urgent call to flee indicates imminent danger and the need for immediate action. In the biblical context, such calls are often associated with divine warnings, as seen in the story of Lot's escape from Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>). The urgency reflects the seriousness of the threat posed by the Babylonian invasion.<p><b>Lie low, O residents of Hazor,</b><br>Hazor, in this context, refers to a region in Arabia, not the more famous city in northern Israel. The residents are advised to hide, suggesting that their usual defenses or strategies would be insufficient against the coming threat. This reflects a common biblical theme where human strength is inadequate without divine intervention.<p><b>declares the LORD,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and certainty of the message. It is not merely a human prediction but a divine proclamation. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that underscores the reliability of the prophecy, as seen throughout the books of the prophets.<p><b>for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar was a powerful ruler known for his military conquests and the expansion of the Babylonian Empire. His campaigns are well-documented both in the Bible and in historical records.

The notion of divine sovereignty is implicit here, as God uses the plans of earthly kings to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used Assyria against Israel (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p><b>he has devised a strategy against you.</b><br>The repetition of the idea of planning and strategy underscores the seriousness of the threat. It highlights the inevitability of the coming judgment, as human plans are often used by God to accomplish His divine will. This mirrors the biblical theme of God&#8217;s control over the nations, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where the king's heart is in the hand of the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazor.htm">Hazor</a></b><br>An ancient city in the northern part of Canaan, significant in biblical history and often associated with judgment due to its idolatry and opposition to God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon, known for his conquests and the Babylonian exile of the Jewish people.

Immediate flight is the only faithful response when God announces judgment (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15-16</a>). The call underscores both God&#8217;s mercy&#8212;He warns before He strikes&#8212;and His holiness&#8212;He will not delay forever (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Escape quickly!</b><p>Speed matters. In <a href="/proverbs/6-5.htm">Proverbs 6:5</a> Solomon urges, &#8220;Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hunter.&#8221; Likewise Paul counsels, &#8220;Flee from idolatry&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>). Delay invites destruction.

Even the most self-reliant community cannot stand when the Almighty moves (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Declares the LORD</b><p>The oracle carries divine signature. When Jeremiah says, &#8220;declares the LORD,&#8221; he reminds hearers that these words originate from the covenant-keeping God, the same voice that created worlds (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). Ignoring the prophet would mean ignoring God Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has drawn up a plan against you</b><p>Here is the reason for haste: God is raising up Babylon as His instrument of discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5-7</a>). Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s military strategy is ultimately God&#8217;s sovereign strategy (<a href="/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37-38</a>). The Lord often uses earthly powers to accomplish heavenly purposes, proving that &#8220;the king&#8217;s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has devised a strategy against you</b><p>The verb &#8220;devised&#8221; communicates calculation and certainty. Babylon&#8217;s plan will not misfire. Yet behind Babylon&#8217;s blueprint stands the unthwartable counsel of God (<a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-27</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>). For the faithful remnant, this truth offers comfort: history is not random; every &#8220;strategy&#8221; is either restrained or released by the Sovereign Lord (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/49-30.htm">Jeremiah 49:30</a> is a trumpet blast of mercy-mingled judgment. God lovingly warns Hazor to flee, quickly and quietly, because He has authorized Babylon&#8217;s calculated invasion. The passage highlights the urgency of obedience, the futility of self-reliance, and the absolute authority of God&#8217;s word and plan.
