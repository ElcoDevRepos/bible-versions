However, it has also been a place of significant rebellion against God. The phrase indicates a continuous provocation of God's anger due to the persistent idolatry and disobedience of its inhabitants. This is consistent with the warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel, who spoke against the spiritual adultery of the people. The wrath and fury of God are expressions of His righteous judgment against sin, reflecting His holiness and justice.<p><b>from the day it was built until now</b><br>This phrase suggests a historical pattern of disobedience and rebellion. Jerusalem's history, from its establishment as the city of David, has been marked by periods of faithfulness and apostasy. The reference to "the day it was built" may allude to the time when David captured the city and made it the capital of Israel, as recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5</a>. Despite its significance as the location of the Temple and the center of worship, the city often fell into idolatry, as seen in the reigns of kings like Manasseh and Amon.<p><b>Therefore I will remove it from My presence</b><br>The removal from God's presence signifies a severe judgment, often associated with exile or destruction. This prophecy was fulfilled when the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem in 586 BC, leading to the Babylonian captivity. The concept of being removed from God's presence is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing separation from His favor and blessing. It echoes the expulsion from Eden in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> and foreshadows the ultimate separation from God for those who reject Him. This removal also points to the need for a mediator, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who restores the relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

From Solomon&#8217;s divided heart (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4&#8211;13</a>) to Manasseh&#8217;s blatant wickedness (<a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12&#8211;15</a>), every generation piled sin upon sin.<p>&#8226; &#8220;From the day it was built&#8221; stresses the long&#8208;standing nature of the rebellion.

Jeremiah had already said, &#8220;Since the day your fathers came out of Egypt&#8230; you have not listened&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The consistency of sin matched by the consistency of God&#8217;s warnings (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15&#8211;16</a>) shows His patience.

To be cast &#8220;out of My sight&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>) meant losing the protective covering of His nearness.<p>&#8226; Yet even in judgment God kept His covenant purposes alive.

The removal is severe, but not final; God&#8217;s faithfulness shines behind the dark clouds of wrath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/32-31.htm">Jeremiah 32:31</a> records God&#8217;s verdict on Jerusalem: centuries of unrepentant sin provoked His holy anger, so He decreed the city&#8217;s removal from His presence. The fall of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile prove the seriousness of covenant disobedience and the reliability of God&#8217;s word. Yet even this judgment fits within His larger redemptive plan, for the same chapter promises restoration, showing that divine wrath and mercy operate together to uphold His righteous character and His gracious purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">From the day that they built it . . .</span>--The words confirm the inference already drawn in the preceding note, that the thoughts of the prophet turn to the time when Israel was yet one people under David and Solomon. Even then, he seems to say, the city had fallen far short of the holiness which it ought to have attained. and which David sought for it (Psalms 15-24), and had only been <span class= "ital">for anger </span>and <span class= "ital">for fury </span>to the Lord. There is no Hebrew word answering to "provocation." It is noticeable that the prophet, as if forgetting that Jerusalem had been a Jebusite city before David took possession (<a href="/context/2_samuel/5-6.htm" title="And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here.">2Samuel 5:6-10</a>), speaks as if it had been built by Israel. It is obvious, however, that it was so much enlarged and altered after this capture, that the words which so describe it may have been not only practically, but almost literally, true.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the day that they built it.</span> It is useless to tell an impassioned orator that his words are not strictly consistent with primitive history.
