Historically, Babylon was a dominant empire, subjugating many nations. The prophecy foretells that Babylon itself will be subjected to the same fate. This aligns with the biblical principle of divine justice, where those who oppress will eventually face oppression themselves. The "many nations and great kings" could refer to the Medes and Persians, who historically conquered Babylon in 539 BC, as well as other subsequent powers.<p><b>and I will repay them according to their deeds</b><br>This reflects the biblical theme of retributive justice, where God repays individuals and nations according to their actions. It echoes the principle found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows." The Babylonians, known for their cruelty and idolatry, are assured of divine recompense for their actions. This also serves as a warning to all nations and individuals about the consequences of their deeds.<p><b>and according to the work of their hands.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The "work of their hands" often refers to idolatry and the creation of idols, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>. In a broader sense, it encompasses all actions and labors that are contrary to God's will. This phrase underscores the accountability of Babylon for its idolatry, violence, and exploitation. It serves as a reminder of the futility of human efforts apart from God and the ultimate accountability before Him. The judgment on Babylon is a type of the final judgment, where all will be judged according to their works, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_great_kings.htm">Nations and Great Kings</a></b><br>Refers to the various foreign powers that would rise and fall, including Babylon, which initially enslaved Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which faced judgment due to its disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that conquered Judah and took its people into exile, serving as an instrument of God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The divine retribution that God promises to bring upon the nations for their actions, emphasizing His sovereignty and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God is in control of the rise and fall of nations, and His justice will ultimately prevail.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Nations and individuals are held accountable for their actions, and sin has real consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_promises.htm">Hope in God's Promises</a></b><br>Even in judgment, there is hope, as God's promises include restoration and redemption for those who turn to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophecy.htm">The Role of Prophecy</a></b><br>Prophecy serves as both a warning and a guide, calling people to repentance and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>God's plans unfold according to His perfect timing, and believers are called to trust in His wisdom and justice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_25_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 25:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Jer_25_14_show_God_s_justice.htm">How does Jeremiah 25:14 demonstrate God's justice against nations exploiting Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_this_reveal_about_God_s_nature_6.htm">What does "repay them according to their deeds" reveal about God's character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_divine_justice_daily_6.htm">How can we apply the principle of divine justice in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_Jer_25_14_Rom_12_19_on_vengeance.htm">Compare Jeremiah 25:14 with Romans 12:19 on God's vengeance.
