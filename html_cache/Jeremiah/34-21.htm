Zedekiah was the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile, reigning from 597 to 586 BC. His reign was marked by political instability and rebellion against Babylon, despite warnings from prophets like Jeremiah. The officials mentioned were likely his advisors and leaders who supported his decisions. This judgment reflects the consequences of their disobedience to God's commands and their failure to heed prophetic warnings.<p><b>into the hands of their enemies who seek their lives</b><br>The enemies referred to here are the Babylonians, led by King Nebuchadnezzar. Historically, the Babylonians were a dominant power in the ancient Near East, known for their military prowess and strategic conquests. The phrase "who seek their lives" underscores the severity of the threat they posed. This was not merely a political conflict but a life-and-death struggle, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation for Zedekiah and his officials.<p><b>to the army of the king of Babylon</b><br>The Babylonian army was a formidable force, known for its advanced military tactics and engineering skills, such as siege warfare. The mention of the "king of Babylon" refers to Nebuchadnezzar II, who played a significant role in the history of Judah, including the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 586 BC. This army was an instrument of God's judgment, fulfilling the prophetic warnings given to Judah.<p><b>that had withdrawn from you</b><br>This phrase indicates a temporary reprieve that Judah experienced when the Babylonian army withdrew, possibly due to the threat from Egypt. However, this withdrawal was not a sign of deliverance but a brief pause before the final judgment. It serves as a reminder of the false hope that can arise from misinterpreting temporary circumstances as divine favor. This situation is reminiscent of other biblical instances where temporary relief precedes ultimate judgment, emphasizing the need for genuine repentance and trust in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of the Babylonian siege.
