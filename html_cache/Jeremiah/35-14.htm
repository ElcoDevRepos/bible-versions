His influence is seen in <a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15-23</a>, where he assists Jehu in eradicating Baal worship from Israel. The Rechabites are noted for their strict adherence to Jonadab's commands, which included abstaining from wine, living in tents, and not sowing seed. This obedience highlights a commitment to a lifestyle that separates them from the surrounding culture, emphasizing faithfulness to their ancestor's instructions.<p><b>He commanded his sons not to drink wine,</b><br>The command to abstain from wine is significant in the context of ancient Near Eastern culture, where wine was a common part of daily life and religious rituals. This abstinence symbolizes a rejection of the cultural norms and a dedication to a life of discipline and self-control. It also reflects a vow similar to the Nazirite vow (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-4</a>), which included abstaining from wine as a sign of consecration to God.<p><b>and they have not drunk it to this very day</b><br>The Rechabites' continued obedience over generations underscores the power of tradition and the respect for ancestral authority. This steadfastness serves as a contrast to the Israelites' disobedience to God's commands. The Rechabites' faithfulness is a living testimony to the possibility of maintaining integrity and obedience over time, despite external pressures.<p><b>because they have obeyed the command of their forefather.</b><br>The emphasis on obedience to a forefather's command highlights the importance of honoring one's heritage and the values passed down through generations. This obedience is a model of faithfulness and respect for authority, which is a recurring theme in biblical teachings (<a href="/ephesians/6.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>). It also serves as a critique of Israel's failure to obey God, their ultimate Father.<p><b>But I have spoken to you again and again,</b><br>God's repeated communication with Israel through prophets demonstrates His patience and desire for His people to return to Him. This phrase reflects the persistent nature of God's call to repentance and the numerous opportunities He provides for His people to change their ways. It echoes the prophetic tradition where God continually reaches out to His people despite their rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13, 25</a>).<p><b>and you have not obeyed Me!</b><br>This statement is a direct indictment of Israel's disobedience and highlights the contrast between the Rechabites' faithfulness and Israel's unfaithfulness. It underscores the theme of covenant unfaithfulness that runs throughout the prophetic literature. The failure to obey God is a central issue in the relationship between God and Israel, leading to the consequences of exile and judgment. This disobedience is a reminder of the need for repentance and the consequences of ignoring God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonadab_son_of_rechab.htm">Jonadab son of Rechab</a></b><br>A forefather of the Rechabites, known for his command to his descendants to abstain from wine and live a nomadic lifestyle.

Jonadab&#8217;s words were not Scripture, yet his children treated them with the same seriousness they would a divine command.<p>&#8226; The Lord highlights this human example to expose Judah&#8217;s lack of faithfulness.

It pointed to a pilgrim lifestyle&#8212;no vineyards, no permanent dwellings (<a href="/jeremiah/35-7.htm">Jeremiah 35:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Restraint from wine was symbolic; it represented wholehearted devotion and self-control (<a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>).<p>&#8226; God never condemns wine outright, yet He praises self-denial when it is an act of worship (<a href="/romans/14-21.htm">Romans 14:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have not drunk it to this very day because they have obeyed the command of their forefather</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and they have not drunk it to this very day because they have obeyed the command of their forefather.&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/35-14.htm">Jeremiah 35:14</a>)<p>&#8226; Century-spanning obedience illustrates that godly habits can be cultivated and preserved.

Jonadab&#8217;s descendants honored a centuries-old family rule; Judah dishonored their eternal covenant Lord. The verse teaches that God values consistent, heartfelt obedience, that He patiently calls His people, and that failure to heed His voice invites discipline. The Rechabites&#8217; simple fidelity invites every believer to take God&#8217;s Word at face value and live it out without delay or excuse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/35-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#7687;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jonadab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3082.htm">Strong's 3082: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonadab -- 'the LORD is noble', a Rechabite, also a nephew of David</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Rechab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1461;&#1440;&#1499;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7394.htm">Strong's 7394: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rechab -- perhaps 'band of riders', a Benjamite, also the head of a nomadic family</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have been carried out.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1463;&#1441;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;&#183;qam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hofal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;iw&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1436;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
