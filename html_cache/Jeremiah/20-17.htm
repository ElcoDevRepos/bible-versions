In the context of Jeremiah's life, he faced intense persecution and rejection for his prophetic messages. The idea of being killed in the womb is a hyperbolic expression of wishing he had never been born, similar to Job's lament in <a href="/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11</a>. This reflects the cultural understanding of life beginning at conception, a view consistent with other biblical passages such as <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>, which speaks of God's involvement in the formation of life in the womb.<p><b>so that my mother might have been my grave</b><br>Here, Jeremiah uses vivid imagery to express his wish that his life had ended before it began. The concept of the womb as a grave is a powerful metaphor, indicating a desire for non-existence rather than enduring suffering. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern view of the womb as a place of both life and potential death, as childbirth was fraught with danger. Theologically, it underscores the tension between the sanctity of life and the reality of human suffering.<p><b>and her womb forever enlarged</b><br>This phrase suggests a perpetual state of pregnancy, which in the context of Jeremiah's lament, symbolizes unending sorrow and unfulfilled potential. In ancient cultures, barrenness or perpetual pregnancy could be seen as a curse or a sign of divine displeasure. The imagery here contrasts with the blessing of children as described in passages like <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>. It also highlights the depth of Jeremiah's despair, as he feels trapped in a cycle of pain and unrelenting burden, much like the unending labor pains described in <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a> as part of the curse after the Fall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is expressing his deep anguish and despair in this passage.

Overwhelmed, he echoes Job&#8217;s cry (<a href="/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11</a>) and wishes life had ended before birth.<p>&#8226; This raw lament is not approval of taking innocent life; Scripture elsewhere affirms that God knits the child together in the womb (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). The prophet is wrestling with pain, not revising God&#8217;s moral order.<p>&#8226; Hard seasons can draw similar thoughts from faithful people&#8212;Elijah asked to die (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>), Paul &#8220;despaired of life&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>). The verse reminds us that believers may feel crushed yet are not abandoned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that my mother might have been my grave</b><p>&#8226; The image of the womb as a tomb intensifies the sorrow. Jeremiah imagines a burial place that spares him the hostility he now faces (compare <a href="/job/10-18.htm">Job 10:18-19</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; He is not cursing his mother; he is lamenting the world&#8217;s sin that makes death seem preferable to life (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Even here, God&#8217;s hand is evident: the prophet can only picture such an alternative because God first granted life. Scripture consistently teaches that life and death are in the Lord&#8217;s hands (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and her womb forever enlarged</b><p>&#8226; An &#8220;enlarged&#8221; womb that never delivers pictures unending gestation&#8212;permanent pregnancy without the joy of birth. Jeremiah longs for an existence that never stepped into the brokenness of the world.<p>&#8226; The phrasing echoes images of insatiable places like Sheol that are never satisfied (<a href="/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15-16</a>). His despair feels endless, yet the very exaggeration shows how deeply suffering can cloud perspective.<p>&#8226; God alone can close or open the womb (<a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-6</a>); by referencing an eternally open womb, Jeremiah implicitly acknowledges the Lord&#8217;s ultimate control even while venting anguish.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/20-17.htm">Jeremiah 20:17</a> captures a faithful servant&#8217;s darkest valley. Under persecution he wishes he had died before birth, picturing his mother&#8217;s womb as an eternal grave. The verse validates honest lament while upholding the sanctity of life taught elsewhere in Scripture. Though despairing, Jeremiah&#8217;s cry is still directed to the God who formed him, reminding us that even when anguish peaks, the Creator remains sovereign, attentive, and ready to restore hope (<a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21-23</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Because he slew me not . . .</span>--The wish that he had never been born is uttered by the prophet in strange, bold language. It would have been better that the messenger that told that he was born had slain him before his birth, that his mother's womb had been his grave, that she had never had strength to bring him forth. Thought, structure, even grammar are, in their abruptness and irregularities, alike significant of intense emotion.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/20-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">kill me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1430;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
