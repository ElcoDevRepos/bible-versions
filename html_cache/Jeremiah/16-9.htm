The title "LORD of Hosts" signifies God's command over the armies of heaven, indicating His power and ability to execute His will. The "God of Israel" highlights His covenant relationship with the nation of Israel, reminding them of their unique status and responsibilities. This introduction sets the tone for a divine pronouncement, underscoring the seriousness and certainty of the message.<p><b>I am going to remove from this place,</b><br>The phrase "this place" refers to Jerusalem and the land of Judah. Historically, this was a time of impending judgment due to the people's persistent idolatry and disobedience. The removal indicates a significant change, often associated with exile or destruction, as seen in the Babylonian conquest. This serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>before your very eyes and in your days,</b><br>This emphasizes the immediacy and personal impact of the prophecy. The judgment is not a distant future event but will occur within the lifetime of the current generation. It serves as a direct warning to the people, urging them to recognize the seriousness of their situation and the urgency of repentance.<p><b>the sounds of joy and gladness,</b><br>These sounds represent the normalcy and celebration of life, often associated with festivals, worship, and community gatherings. Their removal signifies a profound loss and the onset of mourning and desolation. This echoes other biblical passages where joy is turned to sorrow as a result of divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/24-7.htm">Isaiah 24:7-11</a>).<p><b>the voices of the bride and bridegroom.</b><br>The mention of the bride and bridegroom symbolizes the cessation of weddings, which are occasions of great joy and hope for the future. In ancient Israel, weddings were significant social events, and their absence indicates a breakdown of societal and familial structures. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to depict the severity of God's judgment (e.g., <a href="/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>). It also contrasts with the ultimate restoration and joy found in the marriage supper of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>), pointing to the hope of redemption and

title &#8220;LORD of Hosts&#8221; points to God&#8217;s absolute command over heaven&#8217;s armies, underscoring that what follows is not a mere prediction but a decree (<a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>).<p>- Identifying Him as &#8220;the God of Israel&#8221; reminds Judah of their covenant relationship. The coming judgment is not arbitrary but covenantal (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15&#8211;22</a>).<p>- Similar prophetic openings&#8212;&#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221;&#8212;frame messages of warning and comfort alike (<a href="/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>; <a href="/amos/5-3.htm">Amos 5:3</a>). Here the emphasis falls on warning: God Himself initiates the action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am going to remove from this place</b><p>- &#8220;This place&#8221; is Jerusalem and Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3&#8211;15</a>). God is about to lift away what makes life delightful, a direct reversal of covenant blessings.<p>- Removal language echoes earlier judgments: the ark was removed (<a href="/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>), glory departed (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>), and now everyday joys are to be taken.<p>- Cross-reference <a href="/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>, where God repeats, &#8220;I will banish from them the sound of mirth.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before your very eyes and in your days</b><p>- The judgment is imminent, not a remote threat for a future generation. Compare God&#8217;s words in <a href="/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25&#8211;28</a>: &#8220;None of My words will be delayed any longer.&#8221;<p>- First-hand accountability heightens the warning: they will literally watch their city empty of celebration (<a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sounds of joy and gladness</b><p>- Everyday happiness&#8212;laughter in streets, music in homes&#8212;will fall silent (<a href="/isaiah/24-7.htm">Isaiah 24:7&#8211;11</a>).<p>- This silence signals divine displeasure; when God blesses, joy rings out (<a href="/psalms/126-2.htm">Psalm 126:2</a>). When He judges, the opposite occurs (<a href="/joel/1-16.htm">Joel 1:16</a>).<p>- <a href="/revelation/18-22.htm">Revelation 18:22&#8211;23</a> applies the same imagery to Babylon, showing a consistent biblical pattern: unrepentant sin leads to the hush of judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the voices of the bride and bridegroom</b><p>- Weddings epitomize communal joy and covenant hope. Their loss means the life cycle itself is disrupted (<a href="/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10&#8211;11</a> contrasts the future restoration).<p>- Removal of wedding celebration fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>&#8217;s curse: &#8220;You will pledge to be married to a woman, but another will take her.&#8221;<p>- God&#8217;s judgment touches every sphere&#8212;religious, civic, and personal&#8212;because all belong to Him (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a> announces an immediate, God-initiated judgment on Judah: He will strip away public and private joy, silencing even wedding festivities. The decree comes from the sovereign &#8220;LORD of Hosts,&#8221; stressing its certainty. By removing delight &#8220;before your very eyes,&#8221; God confronts the generation that has rejected His covenant. The verse teaches that persistent sin turns blessings into barrenness, yet hints at future mercy (<a href="/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10-11</a>) for those who repent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The voice of mirth . . .</span>--The words had been used once before (<a href="/jeremiah/7-34.htm" title="Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.">Jeremiah 7:34</a>), and will meet us yet again (<a href="/jeremiah/25-10.htm" title="Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.">Jeremiah 25:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm" title="The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD.
