The context is a period of rampant idolatry and social injustice in Judah, leading up to the Babylonian exile. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to communicate God's displeasure and call for repentance. The phrase underscores the persistent disobedience of the people, despite the clarity and urgency of the prophetic message. This reflects a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament, where prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel also faced resistance and rejection from their audiences.<p><b>they will not listen to you</b><br>This highlights the hardened hearts of the people of Judah. Despite the clear warnings and the dire consequences of their actions, they chose to ignore the prophet's words. This resistance to divine instruction is a recurring theme in the Bible, illustrating the human tendency to reject God's guidance. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment that would come upon Judah, as their refusal to listen led to the Babylonian captivity. This phrase can be connected to the New Testament, where Jesus often spoke of those who have ears but do not hear, emphasizing the spiritual deafness that prevents people from accepting the truth.<p><b>When you call to them</b><br>Jeremiah's calling to the people is an act of intercession and a demonstration of God's patience and mercy. Despite their rebellion, God continued to reach out to His people through the prophet. This calling is not just a verbal proclamation but an invitation to return to covenant faithfulness. It reflects God's desire for relationship and reconciliation with His people, a theme that runs throughout the Bible and is ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who calls all to repentance and faith.<p><b>they will not answer</b><br>The lack of response from the people signifies their spiritual apathy and rebellion. This refusal to answer is not just a passive act but an active rejection of God's authority and love. It serves as a warning of the consequences of ignoring God's call, which in the historical context of Jeremiah, led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile. This phrase also points to the broader biblical narrative of human free will and the choice to accept or reject God's offer of salvation. In the New Testament, this is mirrored in the parables of Jesus, where many are called, but few respond.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

They think the temple guarantees safety (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>), but ignoring God&#8217;s word voids that assurance&#8212;just as Jesus later warns in <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>.<p>&#8226; The hardness of the audience underlines the coming judgment: captivity is not capricious; it is the just consequence of sustained deafness to divine truth (<a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When you call to them, they will not answer</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;When you call to them, they will not answer.&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-27.htm">Jeremiah 7:27</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Call&#8221; personalizes the prophetic appeal&#8212;more than information, it is an invitation to relationship. <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6-7</a> embodies this open call: &#8220;Seek the LORD while He may be found.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their silence is deliberate. <a href="/jeremiah/11-8.htm">Jeremiah 11:8</a> says, &#8220;They did not obey or incline their ear.&#8221; Rejection is so entrenched that even direct confrontation elicits no response, paralleling <a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11-13</a> where they &#8220;stopped their ears&#8221; and &#8220;made their hearts like flint.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The principle is reciprocal.

Persistent unbelief turns dialogue into monologue; eventually, even that monologue ceases (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the call itself shows God&#8217;s mercy: He warns before He judges (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). Jeremiah&#8217;s tears (<a href="/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>) mirror the heart of God who &#8220;takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/7-27.htm">Jeremiah 7:27</a> reveals the tragic climax of Judah&#8217;s rebellion: God knows His message will be ignored, yet He still sends it, proving both His justice and His mercy.
