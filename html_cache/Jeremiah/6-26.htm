The term "daughter" is used to convey tenderness and affection, yet also a sense of vulnerability and impending judgment. This familial language is common in the prophetic books, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>dress yourselves in sackcloth</b><br>Sackcloth was a coarse material, often made from goat's hair, worn as a sign of mourning, repentance, or distress. In the ancient Near East, wearing sackcloth was a public demonstration of humility and sorrow. This call to wear sackcloth indicates a need for the people to recognize their sin and the seriousness of the coming judgment. It is a call to repentance, similar to the actions of the Ninevites in <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>.<p><b>and roll in ashes</b><br>Rolling in ashes was another traditional expression of mourning and penitence. Ashes symbolize desolation and ruin, reflecting the inner state of the person or community. This act is a physical manifestation of deep grief and acknowledgment of one's lowly state before God. The use of ashes is seen in other biblical contexts, such as <a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>, where Job repents in dust and ashes.<p><b>Mourn with bitter wailing</b><br>The call to mourn with "bitter wailing" underscores the intensity of the grief expected. This is not a superficial lament but a profound expression of sorrow. The Hebrew culture often included loud cries and lamentations as part of mourning rituals, as seen in the lamentations over Jerusalem's destruction in <a href="/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1:1-2</a>.<p><b>as you would for an only son</b><br>The loss of an only son was considered one of the greatest tragedies in ancient Israelite society, as it meant the end of a family line and loss of inheritance. This comparison highlights the depth of the impending disaster and the profound sense of loss that will accompany it. The imagery of mourning for an only son is also echoed in <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, which prophetically points to the mourning for the Messiah.<p><b>for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us</b><br>The "destroyer" refers to the impending Babylonian invasion, a judgment from God due to the people's persistent sin and rebellion. The suddenness of the attack emphasizes the urgency of the call to repentance. Historically, the Babylonian conquest was swift and devastating, leading to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. This phrase serves as a warning of the immediacy and inevitability of God's judgment, similar to the suddenness of the Day of the Lord described in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2-3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_my_people.htm">Daughter of My People</a></b><br>A poetic expression referring to the people of Judah, emphasizing their close relationship with God and their collective identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sackcloth_and_ashes.htm">Sackcloth and Ashes</a></b><br>Traditional symbols of mourning and repentance in ancient Israel, indicating deep sorrow and a plea for mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/only_son.htm">Only Son</a></b><br>Represents the depth of grief and loss, as losing an only son was considered one of the greatest tragedies in ancient times.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_destroyer.htm">The Destroyer</a></b><br>Refers to the impending Babylonian invasion, a divine judgment upon Judah for their persistent sin and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The verse underscores the urgent need for genuine repentance in the face of impending judgment.

The prophet identifies with the nation&#8212;&#8220;my people&#8221;&#8212;and speaks like a father to a beloved child (cf. <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a>). By using this family language, the verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s warnings flow from covenant love, not cold detachment.<p>&#8226; Judgment is impending, yet the Lord still calls His people &#8220;daughter,&#8221; underscoring relationship even in discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Dress yourselves in sackcloth</b><p>Sackcloth was the rough, uncomfortable garment of grief and repentance. Throughout Scripture it signals a public, humble confession of sin, inviting God&#8217;s mercy (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-3.htm">Isaiah 15:3</a>).

Possibly this was to avoid a supposition which might have occurred to some readers (it has, in fact, occurred to several modern critics) that the "only son" was Adonis, who was certainly "mourned for" by some of the Israelites under the name of Thammuz (<a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), and whose Phoenician name is given by Philo of Byblus as <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. probably <span class="accented">Yakhidh</span>, only begotten, the word used by Jeremiah; comp. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;</span>, equivalent to Berith). M. Renan found a vestige of the ancient festival of Adonis at Djebeil (the Phoenician Gebal) even at the present day. There would be nothing singular in the adoption of a common popular phrase by the prophet, in spite of its reference to a heathen custom (comp. <a href="/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>), and the view in question gives additional force to the passage. But the ordinary explanation is perfectly tenable and more obvious. The phrase, "mourning [or, 'lamentation'] for an only begotten one," occurs again in <a href="/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>.
