The pomegranates are decorative elements, symbolizing fruitfulness and abundance, often associated with the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>).

God designed even these architectural details (compare <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>). Their destruction underscores how total the judgment on Jerusalem was (<a href="/jeremiah/39-8.htm">Jeremiah 39:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the capitals once crowned pillars that proclaimed stability (&#8220;He shall establish&#8221; and &#8220;In Him is strength&#8221;), their loss signaled the removal of what Judah falsely assumed could never fall (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>ninety-six pomegranates on the sides</b><p>&#8226; Pomegranates decorated priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-33.htm">Exodus 28:33-34</a>) and temple furnishings (<a href="/1_kings/7-18.htm">1 Kings 7:18, 20</a>).
