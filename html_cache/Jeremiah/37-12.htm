The city is under threat from Babylonian forces, and political instability is rampant. Jeremiah, a prophet, often faced opposition from the leaders and people of Jerusalem due to his messages of impending judgment. His decision to leave the city may reflect a strategic move to avoid conflict or to fulfill a specific mission. Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and governance, is significant as it represents the heart of the nation's spiritual and political life.<p><b>to go to the land of Benjamin</b><br>The land of Benjamin is located north of Jerusalem and is one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Jeremiah himself was from Anathoth, a town in Benjamin, which adds a personal dimension to his journey. This region holds historical significance as it was part of the original allotment of land given to the tribe of Benjamin during the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11-28</a>). The land of Benjamin was strategically important, often serving as a buffer zone between the northern and southern kingdoms. Jeremiah's movement towards this area may indicate a return to his roots or a need to address matters related to his family or tribe.<p><b>to claim his portion there</b><br>The phrase suggests a legal or familial obligation, possibly related to property or inheritance. In ancient Israel, land inheritance was a critical aspect of family identity and economic stability. The concept of "portion" ties back to the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel, as seen in the book of Joshua. Jeremiah's action may reflect the Levitical laws concerning property rights and redemption (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-28</a>), emphasizing the importance of maintaining one's ancestral land within the family.<p><b>among the people</b><br>This phrase indicates Jeremiah's intention to integrate or interact with the local community in Benjamin. It highlights the communal nature of Israelite society, where individual actions were often closely tied to the welfare and dynamics of the larger group. Jeremiah's presence among the people could also suggest his role as a prophet, where he continues to deliver God's messages and guidance. The communal aspect underscores the interconnectedness of the tribes and the shared responsibility for upholding the covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

The charge that he was &#8220;deserting to the Chaldeans&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>) was false, echoing earlier hostility toward him (<a href="/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to go to the land of Benjamin</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Land of Benjamin&#8221; points to Jeremiah&#8217;s home territory, specifically Anathoth, a priestly town in Benjamin&#8217;s allotment (<a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Benjamin lay just north of Jerusalem; in peaceful times the short journey would have been routine.<p>&#8226; Returning to ancestral land underscores Jeremiah&#8217;s rootedness among God&#8217;s covenant people, not with foreign powers (<a href="/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to claim his portion there</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;To claim his portion&#8221; recalls the deed purchase in <a href="/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6-15</a>, where he bought his cousin&#8217;s field during the siege as a prophetic sign that &#8220;houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-15.htm">Jeremiah 32:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase may describe retrieving the title deed, inspecting the property, or asserting family rights per the kinsman-redeemer principle (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-25</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-4.htm">Ruth 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah lived out the message he preached: judgment was real, yet restoration was sure (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>). Obedience to God&#8217;s instructions came before personal safety.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>among the people</b><p>&#8226; He intended to carry out his business &#8220;among the people,&#8221; transparently and in community&#8212;not secretly at night, nor with foreign soldiers in tow.<p>&#8226; This public stance mirrors how he had earlier handed the purchase deed to Baruch &#8220;in the sight of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By remaining identifiable with his fellow Israelites, Jeremiah modeled steadfast faith when many leaders wavered (<a href="/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>). The prophet stood with the remnant, trusting the Lord&#8217;s promises even as national collapse loomed (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/37-12.htm">Jeremiah 37:12</a> shows the prophet acting on God&#8217;s earlier command to redeem family land in Benjamin. Taking advantage of the brief lull in the siege, he leaves Jerusalem openly to secure his inheritance, demonstrating confidence in the Lord&#8217;s pledge of future restoration. Far from defecting, Jeremiah affirms solidarity with God&#8217;s people and submission to Scripture&#8217;s land laws, embodying the message he preached: judgment is certain, but God&#8217;s covenant promises endure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem . . .</span>--The prophet's motive in leaving the city may well have been his apprehension that the answer he had sent would move the king's anger, and lead, as it actually led, to an order for his arrest. The fact that the Chaldaeans had raised the siege gave him free egress.<p><span class= "bld">To separate himself thence in the midst of the people.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">to take a share from thence in the midst of the people. </span>This gives probably the ostensible reason of his journey. As a priest belonging to Anathoth, he had property (like that which he afterwards bought of his uncle, Jeremiah 32) in the land of Benjamin, and he now went to look after it, either in the way of ploughing and sowing, or to receive his share of its produce during his sojourn in Jerusalem. If, as seems probable from <a href="/context/jeremiah/34-8.htm" title="This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;">Jeremiah 34:8-16</a>, this was a Sabbatical year, the former, assuming the siege to have been raised when the year was over, would be the more probable alternative, and would better explain, as in <a href="/ruth/4-2.htm" title="And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here. And they sat down.">Ruth 4:2</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-9.htm" title="And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.">Ruth 4:9</a>, the addition of the clause "in the midst of the people," as showing that there was nothing clandestine in his proceedings. Other meanings that have been given to the words, "to buy bread," "to till a field," "to separate a field," <span class= "ital">"</span>to conciliate," "to divide the spoil," are less satisfactory. At such a time all the owners of land would be eager to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the departure of the Chaldaean army to transact any business connected with it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - As soon as communication with the outside world was possible, Jeremiah took the opportunity of going to his native country, to obtain something or other which he could only obtain "thence." The Authorized Version says that his object was <span class="cmt_word">to separate himself thence.</span> But <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the rendering is linguistically untenable; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the assumed object is incongruous with the circumstances and Character of Jeremiah, who was neither inclined to seek safety in isolation nor had any motive at present for doing so. The only safe rendering is, <span class="accented">to claim his share thence.</span> Whether there was just then a reallotment of communal lands must be left undecided; this would, however, be the most plausible hypothesis, if we could be sure that the present was a sabbatical year. The additional words, <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of the people,</span> would then acquire a special significance.
