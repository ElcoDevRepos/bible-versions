In the ancient Near East, letters were a common means of communication, especially over long distances. This letter is significant as it conveys God's message through Jeremiah to the exiles in Babylon, emphasizing the importance of written prophecy in the transmission of divine will.<p><b>that Jeremiah the prophet sent</b><br>Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to Judah. His role as a prophet was to be a mouthpiece for God, often delivering unpopular messages. This letter is part of his prophetic ministry, showing his obedience to God's command to communicate with the exiles.<p><b>from Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was the center of Jewish religious life and the location of the Temple. At this time, it was under threat from Babylonian forces. Jeremiah remained in Jerusalem, symbolizing his commitment to his people and his role as a prophet to those who remained in the land.<p><b>to the surviving elders among the exiles</b><br>The "surviving elders" refers to the leaders who were taken into exile. Elders held positions of authority and were responsible for maintaining order and tradition among the people. Their survival indicates that not all were killed or left behind, and they played a crucial role in the community's continuity in exile.<p><b>and to the priests, the prophets,</b><br>The inclusion of priests and prophets highlights the religious leadership among the exiles. Priests were responsible for maintaining worship and religious practices, while prophets were expected to provide divine guidance. This letter addresses both groups, emphasizing the need for spiritual leadership even in a foreign land.<p><b>and all the others Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was responsible for the exile of the Jewish people. This phrase underscores the historical context of the Babylonian captivity, a pivotal event in Jewish history. The exile was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings and served as a period of punishment and purification for the nation.<p><b>from Jerusalem to Babylon.</b><br>The journey from Jerusalem to Babylon was not just a physical relocation but a significant spiritual and cultural shift. Babylon, a symbol of worldly power and idolatry, contrasted sharply with Jerusalem, the city of God. This relocation tested the faith and identity of the Jewish people, challenging them to maintain their covenant relationship with God in a foreign land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

God speaks through His prophet, from His chosen city, to every level of His displaced people, affirming that even under foreign domination they remain His covenant community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XXIX.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">These are the words.</span>--The prophecy in this chapter was addressed to those whom we may describe as the first of the Babylonian exiles who had been carried into captivity with Jeconiah (see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/35-2.htm" title="Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.">Jeremiah 35:2</a>). Among these also, probably in connection with the projects which we have traced in the preceding chapter, there was a restless disquietude, fostered by false prophets, who urged the people to rebel against their conquerors. Against that policy Jeremiah, in accordance with the convictions on which he had all along acted, enters an earnest protest. The letter was sent by special messengers, of whom we read in <a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm" title="By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,">Jeremiah 29:3</a>, and shows that Jeremiah had been kept well informed of all that passed at Babylon. The spelling of the prophet's name, in the Hebrew text, as Jeremiah, instead of the form Jeremia<span class= "ital">hu</span>, which is the more common form throughout the book, is probably an indication that the opening verse which introduces the letter was the work of a later hand. The date of the letter was probably early in the reign of Zedekiah, before the incidents of the previous chapter. It is brought before us as following in almost immediate sequel on the deportation mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/29-2.htm" title="(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)">Jeremiah 29:2</a>. The term "residue of the elders," in connexion with "priests and prophets," points to the fact that the whole body of counsellors, so named, had not been carried into exile, but only the more prominent members. Such "elders" we find in <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.">Ezekiel 20:1</a>. Ezekiel himself may be thought of as among the priests and prophets. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The residue of the elders</span>; i.e. the surviving elders.
