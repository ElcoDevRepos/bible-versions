Jeremiah observes that the people he initially encounters are uneducated in the ways of God. This reflects a broader biblical theme where spiritual poverty is often equated with a lack of knowledge of God (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). The prophet's initial assumption is that their ignorance might be due to their social status, which often limited access to religious instruction.<p><b>they have played the fool,</b><br>The phrase "played the fool" suggests a willful ignorance or rejection of wisdom. In biblical literature, foolishness is often contrasted with wisdom, which is rooted in the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). This indicates a moral failing rather than an intellectual one, highlighting the people's choice to ignore God's commandments and live in sin.<p><b>for they do not know the way of the LORD,</b><br>"The way of the LORD" refers to living according to God's laws and commandments. In the Old Testament, knowing God's way is synonymous with covenant faithfulness and obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>). The people's ignorance of God's way suggests a breakdown in the covenant relationship, which is a recurring theme in Jeremiah's prophecies.<p><b>the justice of their God.</b><br>"Justice" here refers to God's righteous standards and His expectations for His people to live justly. The failure to know God's justice implies a society where moral and ethical standards have eroded. This connects to the broader prophetic message in Jeremiah, where social injustice and idolatry are condemned (<a href="/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-7</a>). The lack of justice is a sign of the people's estrangement from God, and it foreshadows the coming judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Looking upon the masses that toil for bread, those whom the Scribes afterwards called the "people of earth," it was not strange that they who had been left untaught should have learnt so little. The thought finds a parallel in our Lord's compassion for the multitude who were as "sheep having no shepherd" (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm" title="But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.">Matthew 9:36</a>), for the servant who "knew not his Lord's will" (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm" title="But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.
