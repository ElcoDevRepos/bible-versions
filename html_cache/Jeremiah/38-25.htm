The "officials" refer to the princes or leaders who were often in opposition to Jeremiah's prophecies. Historically, these officials were part of the ruling class who felt threatened by Jeremiah's messages, which often contradicted their political strategies. This reflects the broader theme of conflict between true prophetic voices and political powers, seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and they come and demand of you</b><br>The officials' approach to Jeremiah indicates their authority and the seriousness of the situation. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, officials had significant power and could enforce their will through coercion. This demand underscores the pressure Jeremiah faced as a prophet, often caught between delivering God's message and facing human authority.<p><b>&#8216;Tell us what you said to the king and what he said to you;</b><br>This request for information reveals the officials' suspicion and desire to control the narrative. In the context of Jeremiah's ministry, his interactions with King Zedekiah were crucial, as they often involved messages of impending judgment and calls for repentance. The officials' insistence on knowing the content of these conversations highlights their fear of losing influence and control.<p><b>do not hide it from us,</b><br>The demand for transparency reflects the officials' mistrust and the high stakes of the political situation. In biblical terms, this can be seen as a test of Jeremiah's integrity and faithfulness to God's message. The tension between truth and concealment is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the prophet's role as a bearer of divine truth, regardless of personal risk.<p><b>or we will kill you,&#8217;</b><br>This threat of death illustrates the extreme measures the officials were willing to take to maintain their power and suppress dissenting voices. The threat against Jeremiah is reminiscent of the persecution faced by prophets throughout the Bible, foreshadowing the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who also spoke truth to power. This phrase underscores the cost of prophetic ministry and the courage required to stand firm in the face of mortal danger.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often facing persecution for his prophecies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_zedekiah.htm">King Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of Jerusalem's fall to Babylon.

38:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah and the king meet secretly (<a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a>), so any rumor of conversation raises political alarm&#8212;much like when the Sanhedrin heard of Jesus&#8217; private teaching (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they come and demand of you</b><p>&#8226; Zedekiah anticipates an interrogation; the princes believe they have the right to summon the prophet (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/26-11.htm">Jeremiah 26:11</a>; <a href="/acts/4-7.htm">Acts 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;demand&#8221; points to coercion, reminding us of earlier arrests of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s servants often face aggressive questioning&#8212;see Daniel before Darius&#8217; governors (<a href="/daniel/6-12.htm">Daniel 6:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Tell us what you said to the king</b><p>&#8226; The officials want the prophetic message, not for repentance, but to judge its political implications (<a href="/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; In previous messages Jeremiah proclaimed unconditional surrender to Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8-10</a>); any hint of the same would inflame them again.<p>&#8226; Similar curiosity marked Herod&#8217;s interest in John the Baptist&#8217;s words, yet without intention to obey (<a href="/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and what he said to you</b><p>&#8226; They also seek the king&#8217;s response, hoping to gauge Zedekiah&#8217;s resolve.<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s vacillation (<a href="/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19-22</a>) means even his own court does not trust him.<p>&#8226; Like Pilate probing Jesus (<a href="/john/18-33.htm">John 18:33-35</a>), these rulers want leverage rather than truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do not hide it from us</b><p>&#8226; The command assumes they deserve full disclosure, rejecting the privacy of a king-prophet conversation.<p>&#8226; It echoes earlier pressure: &#8220;We will surely carry out every word&#8230;whether good or bad&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/42-6.htm">Jeremiah 42:6</a>)&#8212;yet the same people later refuse the word.<p>&#8226; Concealment, in their minds, equals conspiracy (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/2-16.htm">Nehemiah

Jews who bound themselves to kill Paul (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12</a>).<p>&#8226; For Jeremiah, obedience to God still outweighs mortal danger, reflecting <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts

leadership. Zedekiah fears his own officials more than Babylon, and Jeremiah stands between royal indecision and murderous princes. The verse highlights (1) the princes&#8217; relentless hostility toward God&#8217;s word, (2) the political intrigue forcing Zedekiah into secrecy, and (3) the prophet&#8217;s continual risk for proclaiming truth. It reminds believers that fidelity to God often invites opposition from worldly powers, yet the integrity of His message must never be compromised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/38-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
