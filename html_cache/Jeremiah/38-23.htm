The mention of "wives and children" underscores the personal and familial devastation that would occur. In ancient Near Eastern warfare, the capture of families was a common practice, often leading to enslavement or assimilation into the conquering culture. This reflects the fulfillment of earlier warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who had consistently called for repentance to avoid such calamities (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>). The Chaldeans, a Semitic people who became the ruling class in Babylon, were known for their military prowess and strategic conquests, as seen in their siege of Jerusalem.<p><b>And you yourself will not escape their grasp,</b><br>This part of the verse is directed at King Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, who is being warned of his inevitable capture. Historically, Zedekiah attempted to flee during the Babylonian siege but was captured near Jericho (<a href="/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4-7</a>). The phrase emphasizes the certainty of God's judgment and the futility of resisting His decrees. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of heeding prophetic warnings. Theologically, it illustrates the principle that no one can escape the reach of divine justice.<p><b>for you will be seized by the king of Babylon,</b><br>This prophecy was fulfilled when Zedekiah was captured and brought before Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar's role as an instrument of God's judgment is a recurring theme in the book of Jeremiah. The historical context shows that Nebuchadnezzar was a powerful ruler who expanded the Babylonian Empire and enforced his rule with an iron hand. His capture of Zedekiah symbolizes the complete subjugation of Judah and the end of the Davidic line of kingship, at least temporarily, until the coming of the Messiah, who would restore the throne eternally (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p><b>and this city will be burned down.&#8221;</b><br>The destruction of Jerusalem, including the burning of the city and the temple, was a pivotal event in Jewish history, marking the beginning of the Babylonian Exile. This fulfilled Jeremiah's prophecies of judgment against Judah for their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/34-2.htm">Jeremiah 34:2</a>). The burning of the city symbolizes the severity of God's judgment and the end of an era. It also foreshadows the eventual restoration and rebuilding of Jerusalem, pointing to the hope of redemption and the coming of a new covenant through Jesus Christ (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).

Probably, the last clause should be read with a different punctuation of the Hebrew, "This city shall be burnt with fire."

It would be his own act and deed.<p>(24?26) <span class= "bld">Let no man know . . .</span>--The weak king vacillated to the last moment. He feared the prophet, he feared the princes yet more. To hush up all that had passed in the interview, to urge the prophet to baffle the eager suspicions of the princes by a prevaricating statement, as if it had been he who had sought the meeting, and had petitioned the king, as before (<a href="/jeremiah/37-20.htm" title="Therefore hear now, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray you, be accepted before you; that you cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.">Jeremiah 37:20</a>), to protect him from the cruelties which he had suffered in the house of Jonathan: this was the only course he could bring himself to follow. The plan so far succeeded that the prophet returned and gave the evasive answer which the king suggested. The nature of the interview was concealed, and events took their course; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison till the city was taken. The king's suggestion as to the house of Jonathan implies either that he believed that the princes would urge that Jeremiah should be sent there after his rescue from the dungeon of Malchiah, or else a wish to slur over that transaction altogether.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they,</span> etc.;
