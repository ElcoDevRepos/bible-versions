It is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to signify that the following words are not of human origin but are directly from God. This underscores the importance and reliability of the prophecy.<p><b>Behold, I will stir up against Babylon:</b><br>Babylon was a dominant empire known for its wealth, power, and idolatry. Historically, it was the nation that conquered Judah and destroyed Jerusalem in 586 BC. The prophecy indicates God's direct intervention in the affairs of nations, specifically targeting Babylon for its role in oppressing His people. This stirring up suggests a divine orchestration of events leading to Babylon's downfall, which historically occurred when the Medes and Persians conquered Babylon in 539 BC.<p><b>and against the people of Leb-kamai:</b><br>"Leb-kamai" is a cryptogram for "Chaldea," using a form of Hebrew code known as Atbash, where letters are substituted for others. The Chaldeans were a Semitic people who became the ruling class in Babylon. This cryptic reference may have been used to protect the message or to emphasize the hidden nature of God's plans. The Chaldeans were known for their astrology and wisdom, yet they were powerless against God's judgment.<p><b>the spirit of a destroyer:</b><br>The "spirit of a destroyer" refers to the divine empowerment of forces that would bring about Babylon's destruction. This can be seen as a reference to the Medo-Persian Empire, which God used as an instrument of His judgment. Theologically, it highlights God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to raise up and bring down empires according to His purposes. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment against all worldly powers opposed to God, as seen in the eschatological themes of Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Jeremiah, declaring His judgment and plans.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, tasked with delivering God's messages, often concerning judgment and restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its conquest of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem, symbolizing pride and opposition to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/leb-kamai.htm">Leb-kamai</a></b><br>A cryptic name for the Chaldeans or Babylonians, using a form of Hebrew atbash cipher, which involves substituting letters to conceal the identity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_destroyer.htm">The Destroyer</a></b><br>A force or entity stirred by God to bring about the downfall of Babylon, representing divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and empires, using them to fulfill His purposes.

As with <a href="/isaiah/45-11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a> - 9, the speaker is God Himself; nothing here is conjecture or wishful thinking.<p>&#8226; Scripture never portrays the LORD as distant. He speaks with clarity, warning, and purpose (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>). Believers can rest in the certainty that His pronouncements come to pass exactly as stated (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behold</b><p>&#8226; This single word invites immediate attention&#8212;much like <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>, where the Lord says, &#8220;Behold, I make all things new.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It marks a shift from listening to watching.

Even when human ambition seems dominant, God remains the primary mover (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This action underscores that judgment is deliberate, not accidental (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Against Babylon</b><p>&#8226; Babylon had exalted itself as a superpower (<a href="/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5-8</a>).

The context, however, suggests, in the "fanners" of the next verse, the literal meaning of "wind," and it is quite possible that the phrase may have been used by Jeremiah in this sense, and afterwards acquired a figurative meaning. It does not appear in any earlier book of the Old Testament.<p><span class= "bld">Against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in the heart of my adversaries. </span>In the judgment of most commentators the Hebrew words <span class= "ital">Leb-kamai, </span>which answer to the last ten words of the English, furnish another example of the <span class= "ital">Atbash </span>or cypher-writing of which we have seen an instance in the <span class= "ital">Sheshach </span>of <a href="/jeremiah/25-26.htm" title="And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.">Jeremiah 25:26</a>. Interpreted by that cypher <span class= "ital">Leb-kamai </span>becomes <span class= "ital">Chasdim </span>or Chaldaeans. Obviously the significance of the cypher-words gives force to its employment here, and presents a parallel to the use of the names Merathaim and Pekod in <a href="/jeremiah/50-21.htm" title="Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, said the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded you.">Jeremiah 50:21</a>. Some commentators, indeed, rest in that significance without recognising the hidden meaning of the Atbash. The LXX. and Syriac versions translate "against the Chaldaeans," as recognising the use of the cypher. Both this and Sheshach had probably become familiar in the correspondence between the exiles and those of their countrymen who remained in Judaea, and so both would understand them when used by Jeremiah. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me</span>. The Hebrew has <span class="accented">leb-kamai</span>, which is <span class="accented">Kasdim</span>, or <span class="accented">Chaldea</span>, written in the cypher called Athbash (see on Jeremiah 25:26); just as <span class="accented">Sheshach</span> in ver. 41 is equivalent to Babel. The question arises whether the prophet himself is responsible for this covert way of writing, or a scribe in later times (so Ewald). In favour of the former view it may be urged that Babylon and Chaldea receive symbolic names (though not in Athbash) in the connected chapter (<a href="/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21, 31, 32</a>); in favour of the latter, that the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 1, and does not express Sheshach in ver. 41, also that the clause to which Sheshach belongs in <a href="/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a> is of very dubious genuineness. <span class="cmt_word">A destroying wind;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the spirit</span> (<span class="accented">ruakh</span>) <span class="accented">of a</span> <span class="accented">destroyer</span> (or perhaps, of <span class="accented">destruction</span>).
