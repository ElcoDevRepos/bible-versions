Provoking God to anger is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the Israelites often turned away from God, leading to His righteous anger. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to divine judgment. The concept of provoking God is seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a> and <a href="/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a>.<p><b>by the work of your hands</b><br>The "work of your hands" refers to the idols and altars the Israelites made, which were physical manifestations of their rebellion. This phrase underscores the tangible actions of idolatry, contrasting with the worship of the invisible God. <a href="/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a> and <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a> also discuss the futility of worshiping man-made idols.<p><b>by burning incense to other gods</b><br>Burning incense was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religious rituals, symbolizing prayer and worship. The Israelites were explicitly commanded not to worship other gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This act of burning incense to other gods signifies a direct violation of the first commandment and a betrayal of their exclusive covenant with Yahweh.<p><b>in the land of Egypt</b><br>Egypt represents a place of past bondage and idolatry for the Israelites. Returning to Egypt and adopting its practices symbolizes a regression in their spiritual journey. Historically, Egypt was known for its pantheon of gods, and the Israelites' actions here indicate a return to old ways. This is reminiscent of the Israelites' earlier desire to return to Egypt during their wilderness journey (<a href="/numbers/14-3.htm">Numbers 14:3-4</a>).<p><b>where you have gone to reside?</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate choice to settle in a land associated with idolatry, despite God's warnings. The decision to reside in Egypt reflects a lack of trust in God's provision and protection in the Promised Land. Jeremiah had previously warned against going to Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19</a>).<p><b>As a result, you will be cut off</b><br>Being "cut off" signifies severe judgment and separation from God's favor. This is a consequence of their disobedience and idolatry. The idea of being cut off is seen in <a href="/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a>, where it denotes divine punishment and exclusion from the community.<p><b>and will become an object of cursing and reproach</b><br>This phrase indicates that the Israelites' actions will lead to their disgrace and serve as a warning to others. The concept of becoming a curse is found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where disobedience results in shame and dishonor among the nations.<p><b>among all the nations of the earth</b><br>This emphasizes the widespread impact of Israel's disobedience, affecting their reputation globally. It reflects the idea that Israel was meant to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>), but their idolatry leads to the opposite outcome. This also foreshadows the dispersion and exile of the Jewish people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of the consequences of their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's prophecy, who had fled to Egypt to escape the Babylonian conquest, continuing their idolatrous practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place where the remnant of Judah had settled, seeking refuge but continuing to worship other gods, contrary to God's commands.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The act of burning incense to other gods, which provoked God's anger and was a central issue in Jeremiah's message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_anger.htm">God's Anger</a></b><br>The divine response to the people's disobedience and idolatry, leading to their eventual downfall and disgrace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but can include anything that takes precedence over God in our lives.
