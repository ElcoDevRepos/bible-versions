His role as a prophet was to convey God's words, which were frequently warnings of judgment. This phrase indicates a moment of hesitation and fear, reflecting the dangerous position prophets often found themselves in. Jeremiah's response is to King Zedekiah, who secretly sought his counsel. The prophet's reluctance underscores the tension between speaking God's truth and the personal risk involved.<p><b>&#8220;you will surely put me to death.</b><br>Jeremiah's fear of execution was well-founded. Prophets who delivered unfavorable messages were often persecuted or killed, as seen in the case of Uriah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a>). This reflects the broader cultural and historical context where kings and leaders resisted messages that threatened their power or contradicted their desires. Jeremiah's life was frequently in danger, highlighting the cost of true prophetic ministry.<p><b>And even if I give you advice,</b><br>Jeremiah had previously advised King Zedekiah to surrender to the Babylonians to save Jerusalem from destruction (<a href="/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8-10</a>). His advice was rooted in divine revelation, not personal opinion. The phrase suggests a pattern of ignored counsel, emphasizing the king's stubbornness and the people's unwillingness to heed God's warnings. This reflects a broader biblical theme of human resistance to divine guidance.<p><b>you will not listen to me.&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights the recurring theme of Israel's disobedience and the rejection of God's prophets. Jeremiah's ministry was marked by a lack of response from the people and their leaders, paralleling the experiences of other prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate rejection of Jesus Christ, who lamented over Jerusalem's unwillingness to listen (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>). It serves as a reminder of the consequences of ignoring divine instruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
