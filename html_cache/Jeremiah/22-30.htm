In the prophetic books, such declarations often precede judgments or promises from God, underscoring His sovereignty and the seriousness of the message.<p><b>Enroll this man as childless:</b><br>The man referred to is Jehoiachin (also known as Coniah), a king of Judah. Though he had children, this decree signifies that none of his offspring would succeed him on the throne. This reflects a divine judgment, effectively ending his royal lineage's claim to the Davidic throne. The term "childless" here is symbolic, indicating a lack of dynastic continuation.<p><b>A man who will not prosper in his lifetime:</b><br>Jehoiachin's reign was marked by failure and captivity. He was taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, where he spent many years in prison. This phrase highlights the futility and lack of success that would characterize his life, fulfilling the prophetic judgment against him.<p><b>None of his descendants will prosper:</b><br>This statement extends the judgment to Jehoiachin's lineage, indicating that his descendants would not achieve success or prominence. Historically, this was fulfilled as none of his direct descendants ascended to the throne of Judah, marking a significant shift in the Davidic line.<p><b>To sit on the throne of David:</b><br>The throne of David represents the legitimate kingship over Israel, promised to David and his descendants. This phrase underscores the importance of the Davidic covenant, which promised an everlasting dynasty. Jehoiachin's exclusion from this promise highlights the conditional nature of the covenant based on obedience to God.<p><b>Or to rule again in Judah:</b><br>This final phrase confirms the end of Jehoiachin's line as rulers in Judah. Historically, after the Babylonian exile, the monarchy was never restored in the same way, and the governance of Judah changed significantly. This prophecy also points forward to the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant in Jesus Christ, who is seen as the eternal King in the line of David, ruling not just over Judah but over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin (Coniah)</a></b><br>The king of Judah at the time, whose reign was marked by disobedience to God.

Jesus&#8217; physical lineage flows through Mary, descended from David via Nathan, bypassing the curse (<a href="/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31</a>).
