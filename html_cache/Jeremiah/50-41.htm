Historically, Babylon itself was a northern power that had previously invaded Judah. However, in this context, the prophecy refers to the Medo-Persian coalition that would eventually conquer Babylon. The north often symbolizes judgment in biblical prophecy, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a>, where disaster is prophesied to come from the north.<p><b>a great nation and many kings</b><br>The "great nation" refers to the Medo-Persian Empire, which was a formidable power in the ancient world. The mention of "many kings" suggests a coalition of various rulers and nations united against Babylon. This aligns with historical records of the Medes and Persians, along with other groups, joining forces to overthrow Babylon. The coalition aspect is significant, as it demonstrates the widespread opposition to Babylon's dominance, fulfilling God's judgment against it.<p><b>are stirred up from the ends of the earth.</b><br>The phrase "stirred up" implies divine intervention, suggesting that God is orchestrating these events as part of His judgment against Babylon. The "ends of the earth" indicates the vast reach and influence of the coalition, emphasizing the global impact of Babylon's fall. This also reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1-7</a>, where God uses Cyrus, the Persian king, as His instrument. The imagery of nations coming from the "ends of the earth" underscores the comprehensive nature of God's plan and the fulfillment of His prophetic word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah and surrounding nations.

This is the same summons seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4&#8211;5</a>, where the Lord musters armies against Babylon, and in <a href="/matthew/24-25.htm">Matthew 24:25</a>, where Jesus says, &#8220;See, I have told you beforehand.&#8221; God&#8217;s declarations do not merely predict; they announce realities that are already set in motion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>an army is coming from the north</b><p>&#8226; In Jeremiah&#8217;s day, every major invasion of the Fertile Crescent into Mesopotamia followed the northern arc, so &#8220;from the north&#8221; points to the actual route the forces would travel.<p>&#8226; Though Babylon once descended on Judah from the north (<a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a>), here Babylon becomes the target, and the Medo-Persian forces will approach along that same northern corridor (<a href="/jeremiah/51-48.htm">Jeremiah 51:48</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s use of this familiar direction underlines His control over geopolitical events; He directs history as effortlessly as He guides winds (<a href="/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a great nation</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;great nation&#8221; is the Medo-Persian empire, already gathering its strength during Jeremiah&#8217;s ministry. <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a> foretells, &#8220;I will stir up the Medes against them,&#8221; and <a href="/daniel/5-28.htm">Daniel 5:28</a> records the moment the empire actually topples Babylon.<p>&#8226; Calling it &#8220;great&#8221; assures Judah&#8217;s exiles that Babylon&#8217;s conqueror will be more than equal to the task.

In <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12-14</a>, a future confederation of kings also bands together&#8212;another reminder that God can marshal international coalitions whenever His purposes require it.<p>&#8226; For believers, this underscores the futility of trusting any single earthly power; even empires are pieces on God&#8217;s board (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are stirred up from the ends of the earth</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Stirred up&#8221; points to divine initiative.

He can reach allies no human diplomat could touch (<a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase also foreshadows a final, ultimate judgment on every manifestation of &#8220;Babylon&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9-10</a>).
