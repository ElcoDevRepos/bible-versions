The burning of the scroll signifies his rejection of God's message delivered through the prophet Jeremiah. This act of defiance highlights the king's resistance to divine authority and his attempt to silence prophetic warnings. Historically, this event underscores the tension between the prophetic voice and the political powers of the time. The burning of the scroll is a symbolic act of rebellion against God's word, reminiscent of other biblical instances where leaders rejected divine messages, such as Pharaoh's hardened heart in Exodus.<p><b>containing the words that Baruch had written</b><br>Baruch, the son of Neriah, was Jeremiah's scribe and faithful companion. His role was crucial in documenting Jeremiah's prophecies, ensuring that God's messages were preserved despite opposition. The act of writing down the words signifies the importance of recording divine revelation for posterity. This practice of using scribes was common in the ancient Near East, where oral traditions were often transcribed to preserve teachings and laws. Baruch's involvement emphasizes the collaborative effort in the prophetic ministry and the importance of written scripture in maintaining the integrity of God's word.<p><b>at Jeremiah&#8217;s dictation</b><br>Jeremiah, a major prophet in the Old Testament, received direct revelations from God, which he then communicated to Baruch. This process of dictation underscores the divine origin of the message, affirming that the words were not merely human thoughts but inspired by God. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to convey God's will to the people of Judah, calling them to repentance and warning them of impending judgment. The dictation process highlights the prophetic tradition where God's messages were transmitted through chosen individuals, ensuring the accuracy and authority of the revelation.<p><b>the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah</b><br>This phrase indicates a new revelation from God to Jeremiah, following the king's destruction of the scroll. It demonstrates God's persistence in delivering His message, despite human attempts to suppress it. The phrase "the word of the LORD" is a common biblical expression denoting divine communication, emphasizing the authority and power of God's voice. This moment reflects the unyielding nature of God's purpose and His commitment to ensuring that His word reaches His people. It also foreshadows the indestructibility of divine truth, as seen in other scriptures where God's word endures despite opposition, such as <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>, "The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often facing opposition and persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>Jeremiah's scribe who faithfully recorded the words of the prophet as dictated by him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jehoiakim.htm">King Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah who, in defiance of God's word, burned the scroll containing Jeremiah's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>A written document containing the prophecies of Jeremiah, which was destroyed by King Jehoiakim.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the LORD</a></b><br>The divine message given to Jeremiah, emphasizing the enduring nature of God's word despite human attempts to suppress it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_indestructibility_of_god's_word.htm">The Indestructibility of God's Word</a></b><br>Despite human efforts to suppress or destroy it, God's word remains eternal and unchanging.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_delivering_god's_message.htm">Faithfulness in Delivering God's Message</a></b><br>Like Jeremiah and Baruch, believers are called to faithfully proclaim God's truth, regardless of opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rejecting_god's_word.htm">The Consequences of Rejecting God's Word</a></b><br>King Jehoiakim's actions serve as a warning of the spiritual peril in rejecting divine revelation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_scripture_in_our_lives.htm">The Role of Scripture in Our Lives</a></b><br>Scripture should be cherished, studied, and obeyed as the authoritative guide for faith and practice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_communication.htm">God's Sovereignty in Communication</a></b><br>God ensures His message is delivered and preserved, demonstrating His control over all circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_36_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 36:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_36_27_God_s_control_over_actions.htm">How does Jeremiah 36:27 demonstrate God's sovereignty over human actions and decisions?

But, in addition to the reproduction of the judgment denounced upon the nation at large, there was now a special prediction as to Jehoiakim himself. (1) He was to have "none to sit upon the throne of David." As a matter of fact, he was succeeded by his son Jehoiachin, or Jeconiah, but the reign of the boy-prince as a tributary king lasted for three months only, and Zedekiah, who succeeded him, was the brother and not the son of Jehoiakim (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Write you this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.">Jeremiah 22:30</a>). (2) His dead body was to be "cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost." The same prediction is found in <a href="/context/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>, written probably after the incident thus recorded.
