In the context of Jeremiah, it reflects the prophet's own experience of betrayal and impending danger from those who opposed his message. The metaphor of a lamb is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing purity and sacrifice. This imagery is also a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Lamb of God" in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, highlighting His innocence and the sacrificial nature of His mission. The idea of being led to slaughter without resistance underscores the theme of submission to God's will, a concept central to both Jeremiah's prophetic role and Jesus' earthly ministry.<p><b>I did not know that they had plotted against me:</b><br>Jeremiah expresses his initial ignorance of the conspiracy against him, which reflects the treacherous nature of his adversaries. This element of surprise and betrayal is a common experience for prophets, who often faced opposition from their own people. The historical context reveals that Jeremiah's messages were unpopular, leading to plots against his life by those who felt threatened by his prophecies. This mirrors the experiences of other biblical figures, such as David, who faced conspiracies and betrayal (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>). It also foreshadows the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot, as seen in the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;Let us destroy the tree with its fruit;</b><br>The metaphor of a tree and its fruit signifies the desire to completely eradicate Jeremiah and his influence. In biblical symbolism, a tree often represents a person or a nation, and its fruit represents the outcomes or consequences of their actions. This phrase suggests a comprehensive attempt to eliminate not only Jeremiah but also the impact of his prophetic ministry. The imagery of cutting down a tree is used elsewhere in Scripture to denote judgment and destruction, such as in <a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>, where the Assyrian empire is likened to a felled tree.<p><b>let us cut him off from the land of the living,</b><br>This phrase indicates a plot to kill Jeremiah, removing him from the community and silencing his prophetic voice. The "land of the living" is a Hebrew idiom for the realm of the living, as opposed to Sheol, the abode of the dead. This expression is used in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>, the latter of which is a messianic prophecy describing the suffering servant, widely interpreted as a reference to Jesus Christ. The connection to <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> highlights the theme of unjust suffering and the ultimate vindication of God's servant.<p><b>that his name may be remembered no more.&#8221;</b><br>The conspirators' goal is to obliterate Jeremiah's legacy, ensuring that his name and message are forgotten. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a person's name was closely tied to their identity and legacy. To erase someone's name was to erase their existence and influence. This desire to erase memory is echoed in <a href="/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a>, where the psalmist prays for the eradication of the wicked's legacy. The attempt to erase Jeremiah's name contrasts with God's promise to preserve the memory of His faithful servants, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/56-5.htm">Isaiah 56:5</a>. This also parallels the New Testament assurance that Jesus' name will endure forever (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is speaking in this verse.

The verse highlights:<p>&#8226; The innocence and obedience of God&#8217;s servant.<p>&#8226; The sinful depth of human opposition to divine truth.<p>&#8226; A prophetic preview of the ultimate righteous sufferer, Jesus Christ.<p>In every phrase, God exposes wicked plots, affirms His servant, and assures that neither His word nor His chosen messenger will be forgotten.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Like a lamb or an ox.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as a tame lamb, i.e., </span>one, like the ewe-lamb of Nathan's parable (<a href="/2_samuel/12-3.htm" title="But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.">2Samuel 12:3</a>), brought up in the home of its master. There is no "or" in the Hebrew, and the translators seem to have mistaken the adjective (tame) for a noun. The LXX., Vulg., and Luther agree in the rendering now given. Assuming the earlier date of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a>, the words would seem to have been an allusive reference to the sufferer there described.<p><span class= "bld">The tree with the fruit thereof.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the tree with its bread, </span>here taken for its "fruit." Some scholars, however, render the word "sap," or adopt a reading which gives that meaning. The phrase would seem to be proverbial for total destruction, not of the man only, but of his work. While the prophet's life had been innocent and unsuspecting, his own townsmen were conspiring to crush him, and bury his name and work in oblivion. The sufferings of the prophet present, in this matter, a parallel to those of the Christ (<a href="/luke/4-29.htm" title="And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill where on their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.">Luke 4:29</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like a lamb or an ox</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a mild lamb</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> one of the old translations has it), equivalent <span class="accented">to quasi agaus mansuetus</span> (Vulgate). Jeremiah says that he was as unsuspicious as a tame lamb which has grown up with its master's family (<a href="/2_samuel/12-3.htm">2 Samuel 12:3</a>). The Arabs use the very same adjective in a slightly different form as an epithet of such tame lambs (Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 1:520-522, edit. 1663). It is impossible to help thinking of that "Servant of Jehovah," of whom Jeremiah was a type, who is said, in prophetic vision, to have been "brought as a lamb to the slaughter," and "not to have opened his mouth "(<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The tree with the fruit thereof</span>; apparently a proverbial expression. Giving the words their ordinary meaning, the rendering would <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented">the tree with its bread</span> (<span class="accented">b'lakhmo</span>). Our translators appear to have thought that the transition from "bread" to "fruit" was as justifiable in Hebrew as it is in Arabic (in which '<span class="accented">uklu</span> means properly "food" in general, but also "date fruit"). Fruit, however, was not such an important article of food with the Israelites as with the Arabs; and we must either, with Hitzig, suppose a letter to have intruded into the text, and render (from a corrected reading <span class="accented">b'lekho</span>), <span class="accented">with its sap</span> (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>, Hebrew), or else appeal to the etymology of <span class="accented">lekhem</span> (commonly "bread"), which is "firm, consistent," and render, the <span class="accented">tree with its pith</span> (Hence <span class="accented">lahmu</span> in Arabic means "flesh," and <span class="accented">luhmatu</span>, "a woof"). It is no credit to St. Jerome that he followed the absurd version of the Septuagint, "Let us put wood into his bread." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
