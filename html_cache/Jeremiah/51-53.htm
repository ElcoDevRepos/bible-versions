Historically, Babylon was known for its impressive architecture, including the Hanging Gardens and the massive ziggurat Etemenanki, which some associate with the Tower of Babel. The imagery of ascending to the heavens recalls <a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>, where humanity's pride led to the construction of the Tower of Babel. This connection underscores the theme of human arrogance and God's ultimate sovereignty.<p><b>and fortifies her lofty stronghold,</b><br>Babylon's stronghold refers to its formidable defenses, including its thick walls and strategic location by the Euphrates River. Archaeological findings reveal the city's extensive fortifications, which were considered impregnable. Despite these defenses, the prophecy highlights that no human effort can withstand God's judgment. This echoes the biblical theme found in <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>, where human efforts are in vain without God's blessing.<p><b>the destroyers I send will come against her,&#8221;</b><br>The "destroyers" refer to the Medes and Persians, who historically conquered Babylon in 539 BC. This event fulfilled the prophecy and demonstrated God's control over nations and history. The use of "I send" emphasizes God's active role in orchestrating events, aligning with the biblical narrative that God raises and brings down kingdoms (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment against all earthly powers in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>This phrase affirms the divine authority behind the prophecy. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula, underscoring that the message is not from human origin but from God Himself. It assures the certainty of the prophecy's fulfillment, as seen throughout Scripture where God's declarations come to pass (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). This serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the reliability of His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful ancient city and empire known for its grandeur and idolatry.

Even though that boastful attempt should be realised, Jeremiah says, it should prove a vain defence. As it was, the walls of Babylon which Nebuchadnezzar had built were of enormous height. Greek writers, possibly speaking of different walls (as there were two lines of fortifications), give from 75 to 335 feet. Nebuchadnezzar, in one of his inscriptions, records their greatness in words that remind us of <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm" title="The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?">Daniel 4:30</a>.
