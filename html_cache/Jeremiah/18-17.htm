The imagery of scattering is often used in the Bible to describe the dispersion of a people as a form of punishment (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). The "east wind" is a powerful and destructive force in the Middle East, often associated with bringing desolation and ruin (<a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>, <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>). It symbolizes the swiftness and severity of God's judgment. Historically, the east wind would have been understood as a hot, dry wind from the desert, capable of withering crops and causing devastation, much like the impending Babylonian invasion that would lead to the exile of Judah.<p><b>I will show them My back and not My face in the day of their calamity.&#8221;</b><br>In biblical terms, God's "face" represents His favor and presence (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). To see God's face is to experience His blessing and protection. Conversely, showing His "back" signifies rejection and the withdrawal of His presence. This is a severe form of judgment, indicating that God will not listen to their cries or intervene on their behalf during their time of distress. This concept is echoed in other scriptures where God hides His face as a response to the people's sin and rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>, <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). The "day of their calamity" refers to the impending disaster and suffering due to their disobedience, specifically the Babylonian conquest and exile. This phrase underscores the seriousness of turning away from God and the consequences of persistent unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
