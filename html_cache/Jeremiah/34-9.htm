In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/34.htm">Jeremiah 34</a>, King Zedekiah and the people of Jerusalem had made a covenant to release their Hebrew slaves, in accordance with the law found in <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-18</a>. These laws were intended to prevent perpetual slavery among the Israelites, emphasizing the value of freedom and the dignity of every individual. The release of slaves was to occur in the seventh year, symbolizing a sabbatical rest and a return to freedom, reflecting God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt.<p><b>both male and female</b><br>The inclusion of both male and female slaves highlights the comprehensive nature of the command. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, women were often marginalized, but the biblical mandate ensured that both genders were treated with equity in the context of servitude. This reflects the broader biblical principle of equality before God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where both male and female are created in the image of God. The equal treatment of male and female slaves underscores the importance of justice and compassion in the community.<p><b>and no one should hold his fellow Jew in bondage</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the prohibition against enslaving fellow Israelites indefinitely. The term "fellow Jew" or "brother" underscores the familial relationship among the Israelites, who were all descendants of Abraham and part of God's covenant community. This command is rooted in the historical context of the Israelites' own experience of slavery in Egypt, as recounted in Exodus. The release of Hebrew slaves was a reminder of God's deliverance and a call to reflect His character of mercy and justice. The failure to uphold this command, as seen in the subsequent verses of <a href="/jeremiah/34.htm">Jeremiah 34</a>, led to God's judgment, illustrating the serious consequences of disobedience. This principle also foreshadows the ultimate liberation from sin and spiritual bondage through Jesus Christ, who proclaimed freedom for the captives (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Believers are encouraged to examine their lives for areas needing repentance and seek restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The command was given to the community as a whole, highlighting the collective responsibility to uphold God's standards.

Like Nehemiah later confronted nobles for exacting usury from their brothers (<a href="/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1-13</a>), Jeremiah confronts the king and leaders for the deeper sin of oppression.<p>- Freedom after six years testified to the LORD who liberated Israel from Egypt (<a href="/leviticus/25-42.htm">Leviticus 25:42</a>). Releasing slaves was therefore an act of worship, echoing, &#8220;Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:15</a>).<p>- By ordering immediate emancipation, God underscores that partial obedience delayed is disobedience. Compare Saul&#8217;s half-hearted compliance in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both male and female</b><p>- God&#8217;s directive covers everyone, leaving no room for loopholes. Women, often marginalized in ancient cultures, receive the same protection as men.<p>- This reflects the equal value of every image-bearer of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>) and anticipates the gospel truth that &#8220;there is neither Jew nor Greek&#8230; male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>- The fairness of the Sabbath year rest (<a href="/exodus/23-10.htm">Exodus 23:10-12</a>) extends to servants of both sexes. God&#8217;s justice is comprehensive, not selective.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And no one should hold his fellow Jew in bondage</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;fellow Jew&#8221; highlights covenant family. Oppressing a brother or sister violates the heart of the Law: &#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p>- Isaiah condemned similar hypocrisy&#8212;seeking God while exploiting workers (<a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3-6</a>). True worship dismantles chains.<p>- <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/34.htm">Jeremiah 34</a> later records that after temporary compliance, the people re-enslaved those they had freed. God&#8217;s judgment follows swiftly (<a href="/jeremiah/34-17.htm">Jeremiah 34:17-22</a>), proving He defends the oppressed.<p>- In Christ, the ultimate Jubilee, believers are called &#8220;not to become slaves of men&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>) but to serve one another in love (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/34-9.htm">Jeremiah 34:9</a> reaffirms God&#8217;s longstanding command that His redeemed people must mirror His liberating character by freeing fellow Hebrews after their term of service, treating men and women equally, and refusing to exploit covenant family. Obedience to this decree is an act of worship and a witness to God&#8217;s deliverance.
