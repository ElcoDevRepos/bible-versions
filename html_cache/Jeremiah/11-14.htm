The prohibition against intercession underscores the point of no return in their rebellion. Historically, prophets often interceded for the people (e.g., Moses in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>), but here, God explicitly forbids it, indicating the depth of Judah's apostasy. This reflects a judicial hardening, where God allows people to face the consequences of their persistent disobedience.<p><b>Do not raise up a cry or a prayer on their behalf,</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the seriousness of the situation. In ancient Israel, communal prayer and cries for deliverance were common in times of distress (e.g., <a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>). However, God&#8217;s command to refrain from such actions signifies that the people have exhausted His patience. This mirrors the concept of divine justice, where persistent sin leads to a withdrawal of divine favor.<p><b>for I will not be listening</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine decision to withhold mercy due to the people's unrepentant hearts. It reflects the covenantal relationship where blessings and protection are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). Theologically, it serves as a warning about the consequences of ignoring God's commands and the limits of His patience.<p><b>when they call out to Me in their time of disaster.</b><br>The disaster refers to the impending Babylonian invasion and exile, a historical event that fulfilled numerous prophetic warnings. This phrase highlights the futility of seeking God only in times of crisis without genuine repentance. It echoes <a href="/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>, where wisdom warns that those who reject her will not be heard in their calamity. This serves as a typology of Christ, who offers salvation, but warns of judgment for those who reject Him (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

He is told that it is at once too early and too late for that prayer. The people have not yet been moved to repentance, and their cry is simply the wail of suffering. The discipline must do its work, and the judgment they have brought down on themselves can be stayed no longer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore pray not thou</span>, etc. First Jehovah declares that even the intercession of the prophet will be of no avail (see on Jeremiah 7:16), and then that the belated supplications of the people themselves will be ineffectual to avert the calamity. <span class="cmt_word">For their trouble</span>.
