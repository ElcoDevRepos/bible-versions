In ancient warfare, controlling fords was essential for both defense and invasion. The seizing of these fords indicates a significant breach in Babylon's defenses, symbolizing the beginning of its downfall. Historically, the Medes and Persians diverted the Euphrates River to enter Babylon, fulfilling this prophecy. This event is a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to fulfill His word through historical events.<p><b>the marshes set on fire</b><br>The marshes around Babylon were part of its natural defenses, providing a barrier against invading forces. Setting them on fire would have been a tactic to clear the way for an attack, causing chaos and reducing the city's defensive capabilities. This imagery also symbolizes the complete destruction and purification by fire, a common biblical theme representing judgment. The burning of the marshes signifies the thoroughness of Babylon's impending judgment, as prophesied by Jeremiah and echoed in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon's fall is depicted as sudden and complete.<p><b>and the soldiers are terrified.</b><br>The fear of the soldiers highlights the psychological impact of the invasion. Despite Babylon's reputation as an impregnable city, the sudden breach of its defenses leads to panic and demoralization among its troops. This fear fulfills the prophecy of Babylon's fall and serves as a testament to the power of God's judgment. The terror of the soldiers can be seen as a type of the fear that will grip the world at the return of Christ, as described in <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>, where people will seek to hide from the wrath of the Lamb.

These were at the ends of the streets that ran at right angles to the river, and gates--left open in the panic of surprise--led down to them. Besides these there was one bridge over the Euphrates in the middle and a tunnel under it (Herod. i. 186). The word is elsewhere used for fords, as in <a href="/genesis/32-22.htm" title="And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.">Genesis 32:22</a>; <a href="/judges/3-28.htm" title="And he said to them, Follow after me: for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.">Judges 3:28</a>, but cannot have that meaning here, as the Euphrates was not fordable at Babylon.<p><span class= "bld">The reeds they have burned with fire.</span>--The word for "reeds" is elsewhere (<a href="/isaiah/14-23.htm" title="I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, said the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 14:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-18.htm" title="I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the middle of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.">Isaiah 41:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.">Exodus 7:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-5.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:5</a>) translated "pool." Here it probably refers to the great pool constructed by Nitocris as a reservoir or dock. This was probably left dry by the diversion of the river into another channel, and the reeds which grew in it, perhaps also the flood-gates of the canals, and the ships that were in dock, were burnt by the Persians. The very pools were the scene of a conflagration. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that the passages are stopped;</span> rather, <span class="accented">are seized</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> <a href="/jeremiah/48-41.htm">Jeremiah 48:41</a>). Babylon, it should be remembered, was divided nearly in half by the Euphrates. It was guarded, says Professor Rawlinson, "by two walls of brick, which skirted them along their whole length. In each of these walls were twenty-five gates, corresponding to the number of the streets which gave upon the river; and outside each gate was a sloped landing place, by which you could descend to the water's edge, if you had occasion to cross the river. Boats were kept ready at these landing places to convey passengers from side to side; while for those who disliked this method of conveyance, a bridge was provided of a somewhat peculiar construction" ('Ancient Monarchies,' 2:514). <span class="cmt_word">The reeds they have burned with fire.</span> This rendering is no doubt tenable, though it gives an unusual meaning to the first noun. The "reeds" would be those of the marshes in the neighbourhood of Babylon; and Kimchi suggests that these would be cut down to facilitate the entrance of the army into the city, Surely a very forced explanation. The natural meaning of the first noun is "pools" or "lakes," and, considering that Herodotus (1:185) speaks of a lake in connection with the defences of Babylon, it has been thought (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> by Vitringa) that the prophet may refer to something which was to happen to this and similar lakes; "burned with fire" is then regarded as a hyperbolical expression equivalent to "dried up" (comp. ver. 36). This, however, is hardly less forced than the first interpretation; and we seem almost compelled to assume s corruption of the text, and to read (for '<span class="accented">agammin</span>) '<span class="accented">armonim</span>, palaces. If "palaces" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> lofty houses, for such is the etymological meaning) were not uncommon at Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), much more frequent must they have been at Babylon, Or perhaps the prophet refers to the two magnificent royal palaces, which, together with the temple of Bel, constituted the wonders of Babylon. They were on opposite sides of the river, and were guarded with triple enclosures, the circumference in the one case amounting to sixty stadia (nearly seven miles), and in the other to thirty (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2:514, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/51-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The fords</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ham&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;b&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
