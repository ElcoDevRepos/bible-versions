In ancient times, Egypt was known for its wealth, fertile lands, and powerful civilization, much like a well-nourished and attractive heifer. The heifer is often used in biblical literature to represent nations or peoples (e.g., <a href="/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>). The metaphor highlights Egypt's allure and strength, but also its vulnerability to external threats. The heifer imagery may also evoke the Egyptian goddess Hathor, often depicted as a cow, symbolizing beauty and motherhood, further emphasizing Egypt's cultural and religious identity.<p><b>but a gadfly from the north is coming against her</b><br>The "gadfly" represents an irritant or a small but persistent threat, suggesting an impending invasion or attack. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar, who came from the north to conquer Egypt. The north is often associated with danger and judgment in biblical prophecy (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a>). The gadfly's role as a persistent nuisance implies that Egypt's downfall will come from a relentless and determined adversary. This prophecy aligns with other biblical passages predicting Babylon's dominance over Egypt (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/29-19.htm">Ezekiel 29:19</a>). The imagery of a gadfly also suggests that despite Egypt's strength and beauty, it is not immune to divine judgment and the consequences of its actions, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant nation in biblical history, often representing worldly power and opposition to God's people.

God often uses the small or unlikely to humble the mighty (<a href="/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12-22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;From the north&#8221; mirrors the refrain first sounded in <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>, identifying Babylon&#8212;Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s armies that historically swept south after Carchemish (<a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The imagery underscores how swiftly God can turn prosperity into terror; one bite is enough when the Lord directs it (<a href="/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Egypt&#8217;s idols, armies, and alliances could not shield her; only humble trust in the Lord brings lasting security (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a> pairs Egypt&#8217;s self-confident beauty with the certainty of God&#8217;s judgment.

The nation is like its god. The figure is continued in the words that follow. There comes from the north (from the land of the Chaldees, as in <a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:">Jeremiah 1:1</a>), not "destruction," but a <span class= "ital">gadfly </span>that shall sting the heifer into the madness of agony.

The words find a striking parallel in the Greek legend of Io (probably to be identified with the Egyptian Isis) transformed into a heifer, and her gadfly tormentor, this also connected with the Apis or Mnevis deities of Egypt ('schyl. <span class= "ital">Prom. </span>v. 569). The word for "destruction" is not found elsewhere, but the etymology suggests the idea of "pinching" or "stinging," and the meaning "gadfly" is accepted by many recent scholars.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-26.</span> - A figurative description of the dark future of Egypt. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Like <span class="cmt_word">a very fair heifer.</span> (The insertion of "like" weakens the passage.)

The figure is precisely analogous to that of the "bee in the land of Assyria" (<a href="/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>). St. Chrysostom renders "a gadfly" (see Field, 'Origen's Hexapla,' 2:708); and so virtually Aquila and Symmachus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Egypt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;r&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a beautiful</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3304.htm">Strong's 3304: </a> </span><span class="str2">Very beautiful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heifer,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#7713;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5697.htm">Strong's 5697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A, calf, one nearly grown</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but a gadfly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(qe&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7171.htm">Strong's 7171: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps nipping</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the north</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6828.htm">Strong's 6828: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hidden, dark, the north as a, quarter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is coming against her.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/jeremiah/46-20.htm">OT Prophets: Jeremiah 46:20 Egypt is a very beautiful heifer (Jer.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/jeremiah/46-19.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Jeremiah 46:19"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 46:19" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/jeremiah/46-21.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Jeremiah 46:21"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 46:21" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
