He was placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and was a vassal king. His interactions with Jeremiah, a prophet of God, were marked by fear and indecision. Zedekiah often sought Jeremiah's counsel but lacked the courage to follow through on the prophet's advice. This reflects the broader theme of leadership failure and the consequences of not heeding God's word.<p><b>I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans</b><br>Zedekiah's fear of the Jews who had defected to the Chaldeans (Babylonians) highlights the internal divisions within Judah during the Babylonian siege. These deserters were likely seen as traitors by those who remained in Jerusalem, and Zedekiah feared retribution from them. This fear underscores the political instability and lack of unity among the people of Judah, which contributed to their downfall. The Chaldeans, synonymous with the Babylonians, were the dominant power in the region, and many saw aligning with them as a means of survival.<p><b>for the Chaldeans may deliver me into their hands</b><br>Zedekiah's concern about being handed over to the deserters by the Chaldeans reveals his lack of trust in both his own people and the Babylonians. This reflects the precarious position of Judah as a small nation caught between larger empires. Historically, the Babylonians were known for their strategic use of local populations to maintain control over conquered territories, which could include leveraging defectors against their former leaders.<p><b>to abuse me</b><br>The fear of abuse or mistreatment was a legitimate concern for Zedekiah, as ancient Near Eastern practices often involved harsh treatment of captured kings and leaders. This fear is indicative of the brutal realities of ancient warfare and the consequences of political failure. In a broader theological context, Zedekiah's fear contrasts with the trust in God's protection that Jeremiah advocated, highlighting the tension between human fear and divine assurance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_zedekiah.htm">King Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem.

Zedekiah worries they will seek revenge for how he earlier opposed Jeremiah&#8217;s message and persecuted them by policy (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>).<p>&#8226; His anxiety shows the pitfall of half-hearted obedience: when we refuse clear commands, we create enemies on every side (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the Chaldeans may deliver me into their hands to abuse me</b><p>&#8226; The king pictures a humiliating hand-off&#8212;Babylon turning him over to fellow Jews to &#8220;abuse&#8221; (literally rough-handle, mock, torture).<p>&#8226; Ironically, the opposite would have happened; God had promised safety if he yielded (<a href="/jeremiah/38-20.htm">Jeremiah 38:20-21</a>). Nebuchadnezzar later protected Jeremiah himself (<a href="/jeremiah/39-11.htm">Jeremiah 39:11-12</a>), proving the Lord could also have shielded the king.<p>&#8226; Zedekiah&#8217;s dread became self-fulfilling: refusing surrender led to capture, the slaughter of his sons, and his own blinding (<a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6-7</a>), far worse than the scenario he feared.<p>&#8226; Contrast with Daniel&#8217;s friends, who trusted God amid Babylonian threat and found deliverance (<a href="/daniel/3-17.htm">Daniel 3:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a> reveals a king paralyzed by fear of people rather than anchored in faith in God&#8217;s revealed word. Zedekiah acknowledges Jeremiah&#8217;s authority yet balks at obedience, dreading vengeance from defectors and cruelty from Babylonians. His misgivings expose the danger of listening to God while refusing to trust Him: fear multiplies, consequences intensify, and the very disaster we try to avoid overtakes us. The verse calls readers to believe God&#8217;s promises fully, knowing that obedience, though costly in appearance, is always the safest path.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">I am afraid of the Jews . . .</span>--The special form of fear was characteristic of the weak and vacillating king. It was not enough to know that his life would be safe. Would he also be saved from the insults of his own subjects, who had already deserted to the enemy? These were, in the nature of the case, friends and followers of the prophet, and had acted on his advice (<a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm" title="He that stays in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.">Jeremiah 21:9</a>). The king, who had shrunk from Jeremiah's taunts (<a href="/jeremiah/37-19.htm" title="Where are now your prophets which prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?">Jeremiah 37:19</a>), could not, for very shame, expose himself to the derision of others. Perhaps even he feared more than mere derision--outrage, death, mutilation, such as Saul feared at the hands of the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm" title="Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1Samuel 31:4</a>).<p>(20?22) <span class= "bld">Obey, I beseech thee. . . .</span>--The king's misgiving is met in part by an earnest entreaty to obey the voice of the Lord, in part by the assurance that thus it "shall be well with him" (literally, <span class= "ital">there shall be peace to thee</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> in part also by bringing before him the mockery which is certain to await him if he persists in his defiance. The women of the harem, the surviving wives and concubines of former kings, as well as his own, should become the spoil of the Chaldaean princes, and should take up their taunting proverbs against him. "Thy friends" (literally, <span class= "ital">the men of thy peace, </span>as in <a href="/jeremiah/20-10.htm" title="For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side.
