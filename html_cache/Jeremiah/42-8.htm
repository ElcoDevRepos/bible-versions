Johanan son of Kareah was a military leader during the time of the Babylonian conquest of Judah. His role is significant as he represents the remnant of Judah that had not been exiled. Johanan had previously opposed Ishmael, who had assassinated Gedaliah, the Babylonian-appointed governor. This context highlights the political instability and the struggle for leadership among the remaining Jews in Judah.<p><b>all the commanders of the forces who were with him</b><br>The commanders of the forces refer to the military leaders who were aligned with Johanan. These men were responsible for the safety and decisions of the remnant community. Their presence indicates the importance of the message Jeremiah was about to deliver, as it concerned the future of the entire group. This gathering underscores the gravity of seeking divine guidance in times of national crisis.<p><b>and all the people from the least to the greatest</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the inclusivity of the assembly, indicating that Jeremiah's message was intended for everyone, regardless of social status. It reflects the biblical principle that God's word is accessible to all people. The mention of "from the least to the greatest" echoes other scriptural instances where God addresses entire communities, such as in <a href="/joel/2-16.htm">Joel 2:16</a>, where a similar call to gather is made. This inclusivity also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

This models obedience like Elijah gathering Israel at Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>) and Jesus calling His disciples to hear the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-16.htm">Matthew 28:16-20</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s message is never meant to stay hidden; prophets and apostles alike gather listeners so that no one can later claim ignorance (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The summons underscores accountability.

It also foreshadows that leaders can still resist God&#8217;s word if their hearts are set elsewhere (<a href="/jeremiah/43-2.htm">Jeremiah 43:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Leadership carries a heavier weight (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).
