The restoration signifies not only a physical return to the land but also a spiritual renewal. This promise is a fulfillment of earlier prophecies and demonstrates God's mercy and commitment to His covenant. It also foreshadows the ultimate restoration through Christ, who delivers from spiritual captivity.<p><b>they will once again speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities:</b><br>The return to the land of Judah signifies a restoration of national identity and religious practice. The cities of Judah, once desolate, will be revitalized. This phrase indicates a return to normalcy and prosperity, where the people can freely worship and proclaim God's blessings.

This phrase anticipates a time when Jerusalem will be restored to its former glory and holiness, a theme echoed in prophetic literature concerning the New Jerusalem in Revelation.

The eye of the prophet turns from the northern kingdom to that of Judah, and sees it also as a sharer in the restoration. Jerusalem should be blest, and be worthy of blessing--once more a faithful city, a holy mountain, righteousness dwelling in it (<a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm" title="How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.">Isaiah 1:21</a>). The "holy mountain" is used with a special reference to Moriah and the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-26.</span> - But the prophet would not have Judah suppose that Ephraim has supplanted her; she too shall be restored, and shall enjoy a happy pastoral and agricultural life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As yet;</span> rather, <span class="accented">again</span> (as ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">Mountain of holiness.</span> Does this mean simply Mount Zion, or the whole highland country of Judah (scrap. <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>)?
