Historically, this echoes the promises made to the patriarchs, such as in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, where God promises Abraham that his descendants will be numerous. The context here is post-exilic, envisioning a time when the people of Israel will return to their land and experience growth and prosperity. This multiplication and increase are often seen as a sign of God's favor and fulfillment of His covenant promises.<p><b>declares the LORD,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and certainty of the message. It is a divine proclamation, underscoring that the words are not merely Jeremiah's but are spoken by God Himself. This is a common prophetic formula used to assert the divine origin of the message, seen throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>they will no longer discuss the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</b><br>The ark of the covenant was central to Israel's worship, symbolizing God's presence among His people. It contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, representing God's covenant, leadership, and provision. However, this prophecy indicates a shift in focus from the physical symbol to a more direct relationship with God. This can be connected to the New Covenant prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God's law is written on the hearts of His people, and they have direct access to Him.<p><b>It will never come to mind, and no one will remember it or miss it,</b><br>This suggests a radical transformation in the spiritual life of Israel. The ark, once central, will no longer be necessary or even thought of. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the coming of Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and provides direct access to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>). The focus shifts from external rituals to an internal, personal relationship with God.<p><b>nor will another one be made.</b><br>This indicates the finality of the change. There will be no need to recreate the ark because its purpose will be fulfilled in a new way. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the covenant and the presence of God among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The new covenant established through Jesus makes the old symbols obsolete, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>, which speaks of the old covenant becoming obsolete and aging.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of repentance and warnings of judgment to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Jeremiah to convey His promises and expectations for His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which God gave to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being addressed in this prophecy about a future time of restoration and change.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_shift_from_symbol_to_reality.htm">The Shift from Symbol to Reality</a></b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was a symbol of God's presence, but <a href="/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a> points to a time when God's presence will be experienced more directly and personally.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_multiplication_and_increase.htm">The Promise of Multiplication and Increase</a></b><br>God's promise of growth and prosperity is contingent upon the people's faithfulness and repentance, highlighting the importance of spiritual renewal.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_covenant.htm">The New Covenant</a></b><br>This verse foreshadows the new covenant through Christ, where the law is written on hearts rather than tablets, emphasizing a personal relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_earthly_symbols.htm">The Transience of Earthly Symbols</a></b><br>Earthly symbols and rituals, while important, are temporary and point to a greater spiritual reality that is fulfilled in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_restoration.htm">Hope for Restoration</a></b><br>Despite past unfaithfulness, God promises a future of restoration and blessing, encouraging believers to trust in His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_3_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_3_16_shift_to_spiritual_worship.htm">How does Jeremiah 3:16 emphasize the shift from physical to spiritual worship?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_no_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">What does "no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant'" signify for believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Jeremiah_3_16_to_modern_faith.htm">How can we apply Jeremiah 3:16's message to our modern faith practices?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Jer_3_16_to_NT_worship_teachings.htm">Connect Jeremiah 3:16 with New Testament teachings on worship and God's presence.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_3_16_Prioritize_God_over_symbols.htm">How does Jeremiah 3:16 challenge us to prioritize God's presence over religious symbols?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_3_16_s_view_on_Ark_s_role.htm">What does Jeremiah 3:16 imply about the significance of the Ark of the Covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_3_16_s_impact_on_symbols.htm">How does Jeremiah 3:16 challenge traditional views on religious symbols?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_forget_the_Ark_in_Jeremiah_3_16.htm">Why does Jeremiah 3:16 suggest the Ark will no longer be remembered?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_revere_the_ark_if_it's_forgotten.htm">If Jeremiah 3:16 asserts the Ark of the Covenant will no longer be remembered, why do other biblical texts and traditions continue to revere it? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_jesus_inherit_david's_throne.htm">Would Jesus inherit David's throne?

We must remember that the ark is represented in the Law as the throne of Jehovah, who was "enthroned upon the cherubim" on the lid of the ark. It is in virtue of this sacramental presence that the temple is called the "dwelling-places" of Jehovah (e.g. <a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-1.htm">Psalm 84:1</a>, where Authorized Version has wrongly "tabernacles"). Now, in the Messianic period the consciousness of Jehovah's presence was to be so widely spread, at any rate in the center of God's kingdom, the holy city, that the ark would no longer be thought of; it would be, if not destroyed (we know, as a matter of fact, that the ark was destroyed in some unrecorded way), yet at least become utterly unimportant. Jerusalem would then naturally succeed to the title "Jehovah's throne" (applied to the temple in <a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall it come to mind</span>. The same phrase is used of the old heaven and earth as compared with the new (<a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>). In the concluding clauses, "visit" should rather be "miss," and "that be done" should be "it [viz. the ark] be made." On the whole subject of the prophetic descriptions of the worship of the Messianic period - descriptions which often wear at any rate a superficial appearance of inconsistency, see the luminous remarks of Professor Riehm, 'Messianic Prophecy,' pp. 161-163. At the same time, we must be extremely cautious how far we admit that Old Testament prophecies of the latter days have received a complete fulfillment in the Christian Church, considering how far the latter is from the realizable ideal, and also the importance attached in the New Testament as well as in the Old to the continuance of Israel as a nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1433;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
