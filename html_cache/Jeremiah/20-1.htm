Priests were responsible for temple rituals and maintaining the spiritual life of the nation. His position suggests he had significant influence and authority, especially in religious matters. The name Pashhur means "freedom" or "liberation," which is ironic given his actions against Jeremiah.<p><b>the son of Immer</b><br>The mention of Immer connects Pashhur to a specific priestly lineage. The family of Immer was one of the priestly divisions established by King David (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-14.htm">1 Chronicles 24:14</a>). This lineage underscores Pashhur's established role and authority within the temple system.<p><b>and the chief official in the house of the LORD</b><br>As the chief official, Pashhur held a high-ranking position, possibly akin to a temple governor or overseer. This role would have involved administrative duties and maintaining order within the temple precincts. His authority extended to enforcing religious laws and dealing with those perceived as threats to the temple's sanctity.<p><b>heard Jeremiah prophesying these things</b><br>Jeremiah's prophecies were often messages of impending judgment and calls for repentance, which were unpopular among the religious and political leaders of his time. The phrase "these things" refers to the specific prophecies of doom and destruction that Jeremiah had been delivering, particularly concerning the fate of Jerusalem and the temple (<a href="/jeremiah/19-14.htm">Jeremiah 19:14-15</a>). Jeremiah's message challenged the status quo and threatened the complacency of the religious leaders, leading to conflict with figures like Pashhur.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pashhur.htm">Pashhur</a></b><br>A priest and the son of Immer, who held a significant position as the chief officer in the temple.

Like Amaziah silencing Amos (<a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10-13</a>), Pashhur chooses suppression over repentance.<p>- His response illustrates the heart-level divide Jesus later highlights: &#8220;Light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>).<p>- The scene sets up the following verses, where Pashhur&#8217;s persecution leads to Jeremiah&#8217;s imprisonment (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>) and God&#8217;s pronouncement of Pashhur&#8217;s new name, &#8220;Terror on Every Side&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3-6</a>), proving that opposing God&#8217;s word invites personal judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a> introduces a confrontation between faithful prophecy and compromised priesthood. Pashhur&#8212;well-placed, well-connected, and in charge&#8212;reacts against the hard truth Jeremiah proclaims. His lineage and office fail to shield him from accountability; instead, they heighten it. The verse warns that religious position is no substitute for submission to God&#8217;s word, and it prepares us to see how God vindicates His messenger and judges those who try to silence Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XX.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Pashur the son of Immer.</span>--The description must be remembered as distinguishing him from the son of Melchiah of the same name in <a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,">Jeremiah 21:1</a>.

The name here (like that of "the sons of Korah") may indicate simply the fact that he belonged to this section; or, possibly, the name of the patriarch (so to speak) who gave its name to it may have re-appeared from time to time in the line of his descendants. The name of Pashur appears again, after the Captivity, in <a href="/context/ezra/2-37.htm" title="The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.">Ezra 2:37-38</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Chief governor.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">deputy-governor. </span>The word for <span class= "ital">governor </span>is <span class= "ital">Nagid, </span>and this office was assigned to the high priest as the "ruler of the house of God" (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-11.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;">1Chronicles 9:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-13.htm" title="And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.">2Chronicles 31:13</a>). In the case of Zephaniah, who appears as <span class= "ital">Nagid </span>in <a href="/jeremiah/29-26.htm" title="The LORD has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison, and in the stocks.">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, it was given to him as the "second priest" (<a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">2Kings 25:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-14.htm" title="And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.">Jeremiah 52:14</a>). Next in order to him was the <span class= "ital">Pakid, </span>the deputy, or, perhaps, better, <span class= "ital">superintendent. </span>Here Pashur is described by the combination of the two titles, possibly as implying that he was invested, though a "deputy," with the full powers of the "governor." By some commentators, however, the relation of the two words is inverted, the <span class= "ital">Nagid </span>being added to the <span class= "ital">Pakid, </span>to imply that Pashur was the chief warden or overseer. As such, on either view, the act and the words of Jeremiah came under his official notice. That such words should be spoken in the court of the Temple to the multitude assembled there was, we must believe, something new, and Pashur was resolved at any cost to prevent its repetition. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Pashhur</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(pa&#353;&#183;&#7717;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6583.htm">Strong's 6583: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pashhur -- five Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the priest,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
