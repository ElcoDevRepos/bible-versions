In biblical times, birds were often caught and kept in cages, symbolizing confinement and lack of freedom. This metaphor suggests that the people are ensnared by their own deceitful practices. The imagery of birds in cages can also be seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>, where humans are caught in evil times like birds in a snare. This reflects the spiritual bondage that results from sin and deceit.<p><b>so their houses are full of deceit</b><br>The "houses" here symbolize not just physical dwellings but also the households and lives of the people. Deceit has permeated their entire existence, indicating a systemic corruption. In the historical context of Jeremiah, the leaders and people of Judah were engaging in dishonest practices, turning away from God's commandments. This deceit is a violation of the covenant relationship with God, as seen in the broader narrative of Jeremiah, where the prophet calls out the people's unfaithfulness and idolatry.<p><b>Therefore they have become powerful and rich</b><br>The accumulation of power and wealth through deceit highlights a moral and spiritual decline. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's blessing, but here it is obtained through unrighteous means. This reflects a broader biblical theme where ill-gotten gains lead to judgment, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6</a>, which warns against acquiring treasures through lying. The temporary success of the wicked is contrasted with the ultimate justice of God, a theme that runs throughout the prophetic literature. This also foreshadows the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who warns against storing up treasures on earth through unjust means (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing impending judgment due to its persistent sin and rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceitful_people.htm">The Deceitful People</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Judah who have filled their homes with deceit, leading to their unjust gain and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_deceit.htm">The Danger of Deceit</a></b><br>Deceit can fill our lives like a cage traps birds, leading to spiritual bondage and separation from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/false_security_in_wealth.htm">False Security in Wealth</a></b><br>Accumulating wealth through dishonest means may bring temporary power and riches, but it ultimately leads to judgment and loss.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_integrity.htm">Call to Integrity</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to live lives of integrity, reflecting God's truth and righteousness in all our dealings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Persistent sin and deceit have consequences, both in our relationship with God and in our earthly lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>God offers forgiveness and restoration to those who turn away from deceit and seek His truth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_5_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 5:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_5_27_Heart_s_deceitfulness.htm">How does Jeremiah 5:27 illustrate the deceitfulness of the human heart?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_5_27_vs_today_s_corruption.htm">What parallels exist between Jeremiah 5:27 and modern-day societal corruption?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Christians_avoid_deceitfulness.htm">How can Christians guard against becoming "full of deceit" like cages in Jeremiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_warn_of_deceit.htm">What other scriptures warn against deceit and its consequences?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Use_Jeremiah_5_27_to_boost_integrity.htm">How can we apply Jeremiah 5:27 to promote integrity in our communities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_5_27_on_human_nature_morals.htm">How does Jeremiah 5:27 reflect on human nature and moral corruption?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Jeremiah_5_27.htm">What historical context influenced the message in Jeremiah 5:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_5_27_God_s_judgment_link.htm">How does Jeremiah 5:27 relate to God's judgment and justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_some_christians_act_worse.htm">Why do many self-proclaimed Christians behave worse than atheists?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_jer_27_7_contradict_other_prophecies.htm">Does Jeremiah 27:7 contradict other biblical prophecies by suggesting a succession of Babylonian kings long after Nebuchadnezzar?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_judge_deceitful_hearts.htm">(Jeremiah 17:9) If the heart is so deceitful, why would a just God hold humans accountable for following their inherent nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_jeremiah_27_5_align_with_science.htm">How can Jeremiah 27:5's claim that God made the earth, humans, and animals be reconciled with current scientific understandings of evolution and cosmology?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Jeremiah 5:27 Mean</div><b>Like cages full of birds</b><p>Jeremiah paints a picture everyone can visualize: a trapper&#8217;s coop jam-packed with flapping birds, unable to escape.<p>&#8226;

Fraudulent scales (<a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>), bribery (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>), and perverted justice (<a href="/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>) are normal furniture in their homes.<p>&#8226; God sees behind closed doors. <a href="/psalms/101-7.htm">Psalm 101:7</a>: &#8220;No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house.&#8221; The verse in Jeremiah shows the exact opposite condition among Judah&#8217;s elites.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Therefore they have become powerful and rich</b><p>We might expect corruption to ruin people, yet for a season it often fattens them.<p>&#8226; The adverb &#8220;therefore&#8221; ties prosperity directly to dishonesty&#8212;ill-gotten gain (<a href="/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Wealth and influence built on fraud never impress God; He calls it &#8220;treasures of wickedness&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a> pronounces woe on the man who &#8220;builds his house by unjust gain.&#8221; The same verdict hangs over the powerbrokers of Jeremiah&#8217;s day.<p>&#8226; Their temporary success becomes evidence for the coming judgment described later in the chapter (<a href="/jeremiah/5-29.htm">Jeremiah 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/5-27.htm">Jeremiah 5:27</a> exposes a three-step progression: trapping people like birds, stuffing private lives with deceit, and fattening wallets through that deceit.

The root means to plait or braid; hence some sort of basket-work seems to be meant. Connecting this with the preceding verse, Hitzig seems right in inferring that the "cage" was at the same time a trap (comp. Ecclus. 11:30, "Like as a partridge taken <span class="accented">in a cage</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, a peculiar kind of basket], so is the heart of the proud"). Canon Tristram suggests that there is an allusion to decoy-birds, which are still much employed in Syria, and are carefully trained for their office ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 163), But this seems to go beyond the text. <span class="cmt_word">Deceit</span>;
