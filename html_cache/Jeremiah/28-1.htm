This timing is significant as it often marks a period of mourning and reflection for the Jewish people, particularly due to the destruction of the First and Second Temples, which both occurred in this month. The context of mourning and reflection may underscore the gravity of the prophetic messages being delivered.<p><b>the fourth year</b><br>The fourth year refers to the fourth year of King Zedekiah's reign, which would be around 593 BC. This period was marked by political instability and pressure from Babylon, as Zedekiah was a vassal king under Nebuchadnezzar. The fourth year is significant because it was a time when false hopes of liberation from Babylonian control were prevalent among the people of Judah.<p><b>near the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah</b><br>Zedekiah was the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile. His reign began in 597 BC after the deportation of King Jehoiachin. Zedekiah's reign was characterized by political turmoil and rebellion against Babylonian rule, which ultimately led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Understanding Zedekiah's reign provides insight into the desperate and rebellious spirit of the time, which often led to false prophecies and misguided hopes.<p><b>the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur</b><br>Hananiah is introduced as a prophet, but his message is later revealed to be false. His lineage, being the son of Azzur, is mentioned to establish his identity and possibly his credibility among the people. Hananiah's role as a false prophet is crucial in understanding the conflict between true and false prophecy during this period, as Jeremiah's true prophecies often contradicted the more optimistic messages of prophets like Hananiah.<p><b>who was from Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was a significant city located northwest of Jerusalem. It was known for its historical and religious importance, including being a Levitical city and a site where the tabernacle was located for a time. The mention of Gibeon may imply that Hananiah had a religious background or influence, which could have lent him credibility in the eyes of the people.<p><b>said to me in the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship and religious authority for the people of Judah. Delivering a prophecy in the temple would have given it an air of authority and divine sanction. This setting highlights the seriousness of the prophetic confrontation between Hananiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>in the presence of the priests and all the people</b><br>The presence of the priests and all the people indicates that this was a public declaration, meant to influence and sway the opinion of the religious leaders and the general populace. The public nature of the prophecy underscores the tension between true and false prophecy, as well as the responsibility of the priests and people to discern the truth. This setting also reflects the communal aspect of worship and decision-making in ancient Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah,_king_of_judah.htm">Zedekiah, King of Judah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile, Zedekiah's reign was marked by political instability and spiritual decline.

Of the Hananiah who appears as the most prominent of the prophet's adversaries, we know nothing beyond what is here recorded. He was clearly one of the leaders of the party of resistance whom we have seen at work trying to form an alliance with the neighbouring rations in Jeremiah 27, and whose hopes had been revived by the accession of Pharaoh Hophra (Apries) to the throne of Egypt in B.C. 595. The mention of Gibeon suggests two or three thoughts not without interest :--(1) It was, like Anathoth, within the tribe of Benjamin, about six or seven miles from Jerusalem, and so the antagonism between the true prophet and the false in Jerusalem may have been the revival of older local conflicts. (2) Gibeon, like Anathoth, was one of the cities of priests (<a href="/joshua/21-17.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:17</a>), and Hananiah was probably, therefore, a priest as well as prophet. (3) As still retaining the venerable relics of a worship that had passed away; it had also once been the sanctuary of Jehovah (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,">1Chronicles 16:39</a>). There the old tabernacle stood which had been with the people in the wilderness--which had been removed from Shiloh when the sacred ark was taken (<a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2Chronicles 1:3</a>). There Solomon, at the beginning of his reign, offered a stately sacrifice (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.">1Kings 3:4</a>). Ought not the prophet who had grown up in the midst of those surroundings to have learnt that no place, however sacred, could count on being safe from the changes and chances of time, all fulfilling the righteous purposes of God? The occasion on which he now appears was probably one of the new moon, Sabbath, or other feast-days on which the courts of the Temple were crowded. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah</span>.
