This reflects the broader context of his ministry, where he often faced rejection and hostility. The question highlights the prophet's isolation and the spiritual blindness of the people. It echoes the sentiments of other prophets, such as Isaiah, who also lamented the people's hard-heartedness (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>).<p><b>Who will listen to me?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the widespread apathy and resistance among the people of Judah. It suggests a deep-seated spiritual deafness, a theme prevalent in the prophetic literature. The people's refusal to listen is not just a rejection of Jeremiah but of God Himself, as the prophet speaks on God's behalf. This mirrors the New Testament, where Jesus often encountered similar resistance (<a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>).<p><b>Look, their ears are closed, so they cannot hear.</b><br>The imagery of closed ears signifies a deliberate choice to ignore God's message. In the ancient Near Eastern context, hearing was synonymous with obedience. Thus, closed ears indicate a refusal to obey. This condition is not just physical but spiritual, reflecting a hardened heart. The Apostle Paul later describes a similar condition in <a href="/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8</a>, where God gives people over to a "spirit of stupor."<p><b>See, the word of the LORD has become offensive to them;</b><br>The word "offensive" suggests that the people find God's message intolerable or burdensome. This reaction is indicative of a society that has strayed far from God's covenant. The offense taken at God's word is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the rejection of Jesus' teachings by many of His contemporaries (<a href="/john/6-60.htm">John 6:60-66</a>). It highlights the human tendency to resist divine truth when it challenges personal desires or societal norms.<p><b>they find no pleasure in it.</b><br>This phrase indicates a complete lack of delight or joy in God's word, contrasting with the psalmist's attitude in <a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>, where God's words are described as "sweeter than honey." The absence of pleasure in God's word suggests a spiritual decay and a preference for worldly pleasures over divine truth. This condition is a warning to all believers about the dangers of becoming desensitized to God's voice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

God&#8217;s prophet is looking for receptive hearts among Judah, yet everywhere he turns he&#8217;s met with disinterest. Similar moments appear when Moses pleaded with stubborn Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9-11</a>) and when Jesus wept over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>). The pattern is clear:<p>&#8226; God always raises a voice before judgment.<p>&#8226; He looks for those who will respond, because His desire is to save, not to destroy (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; When the messenger sees no open ears, the weight of coming judgment feels even heavier.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who will listen to me?</b><p>The second question deepens the lament. Jeremiah isn&#8217;t merely seeking an audience; he&#8217;s searching for genuine listeners&#8212;people ready to act. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> urges, &#8220;Be doers of the word and not hearers only.&#8221; In Jeremiah&#8217;s day, religious formalism masked spiritual deafness, just as Jesus later warned that many would have ears yet fail to hear (<a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>). Authentic listening involves:<p>&#8226; Humility&#8212;admitting we need God&#8217;s correction (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience&#8212;aligning life to what we hear (<a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Perseverance&#8212;continuing in truth despite cultural pushback (<a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look, their ears are closed, so they cannot hear.</b><p>This line exposes the root issue. Repeated rejection of God&#8217;s word leads to a hardening of spiritual senses (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-25</a>). Isaiah faced the same condition (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>), and Stephen confronted it in his final sermon, calling his hearers &#8220;stiff-necked&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>). Closed ears result from:<p>&#8226; Willful sin&#8212;cherishing darkness over light (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Pride&#8212;trusting human wisdom above God&#8217;s revelation (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Idolatry&#8212;letting anything replace wholehearted devotion (<a href="/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3-5</a>).<p>Once ears are shut, even clear warnings sound like noise rather than life-saving truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>See, the word of the LORD has become offensive to them; they find no pleasure in it.</b><p>What once delighted the soul (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-10</a>) now offends. Paul describes this reaction: &#8220;The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>). When God&#8217;s standards clash with self-centered desires, people dismiss His voice as outdated or harsh (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>). Key signs that Scripture has become offensive include:<p>&#8226; Selective hearing&#8212;embracing comforting verses, ignoring convicting ones.<p>&#8226; Mockery&#8212;labeling biblical morality as intolerant (<a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Apathy&#8212;finding more &#8220;pleasure&#8221; in entertainment than in truth (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11-12</a>).<p>The tragedy is that rejecting God&#8217;s word removes the very remedy for sin and judgment (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a> captures the heartbreak of a prophet who carries God&#8217;s urgent warning yet meets closed ears and offended hearts. The verse reminds us that persistent refusal to heed Scripture hardens us, making God&#8217;s life-giving word seem bothersome. True listening demands humility, obedience, and delight in God&#8217;s truth. May we keep our ears open, lest we repeat Judah&#8217;s mistake and miss the gracious warnings meant to rescue us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">To whom shall I speak . . .</span>?--The prophet, who now speaks in his own name, has heard the message from the Lord of Hosts; but what avails it? who will listen?
