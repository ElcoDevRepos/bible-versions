In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet often receives direct revelations from God, which he then communicates to the people. This underscores the authority and divine origin of the prophecy. The phrase "message from the LORD" is a common introduction in prophetic literature, signifying that what follows is not merely human opinion but divine instruction or warning.<p><b>an envoy has been sent to the nations:</b><br>The term "envoy" suggests a messenger or representative, possibly angelic or symbolic, tasked with delivering God's message to various nations. This reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty over all nations, not just Israel. The idea of sending an envoy implies a formal and urgent communication, often seen in ancient Near Eastern diplomatic practices. This also connects to other scriptures where God uses messengers to convey His will, such as in <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a> and <a href="/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 1</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Assemble yourselves to march against her!</b><br>The call to "assemble" is a summons for the nations to gather for a specific purpose, in this case, to march against a particular target. This reflects the common biblical motif of God using foreign nations as instruments of His judgment. The phrase suggests a military campaign, which was a frequent occurrence in the ancient world, where alliances were formed to confront common enemies. The "her" likely refers to Edom, as the broader context of <a href="/jeremiah/49.htm">Jeremiah 49</a> addresses the judgment against Edom.<p><b>Rise up for battle!&#8221;</b><br>This command to "rise up" is a call to action, urging immediate readiness and engagement in warfare. It highlights the urgency and seriousness of the impending conflict. In the biblical context, rising up for battle often involves divine empowerment or sanction, as seen in other instances where God commands His people or other nations to engage in battle (e.g., <a href="/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the fulfillment of God's judgment, as the nations are mobilized to execute His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of Judah and the surrounding nations.

The &#8220;envoy&#8221; (or messenger) pictures a herald carrying heaven&#8217;s summons to earthly powers, just as we see in <a href="/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2&#8211;4</a>.<p>&#8226; The nations are instruments in the LORD&#8217;s hand (<a href="/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5&#8211;7</a>).

For Edom, the message signals inescapable ruin; for us, it underscores that the moral governance of the universe rests in God&#8217;s hands, urging humble trust and reverent obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">I have heard a rumour from the Lord . . .</span>--The thought is that of Jehovah, as the great King, sending forth His herald or envoy to call the nations to the attack on Edom.

Jeremiah, to justify his adoption of the outward form of his prophecy, declares that he is personally responsible for its substance. "Rumour," or as the word is elsewhere rendered, "report," is a technical term for a prophetic revelation (<a href="/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9, 19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>; comp. <a href="/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>); and it is from this Old Testament usage that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;</span> acquires its special meaning in <a href="/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16, 17</a>. In fact, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;</span>, or bearing, is a more exact equivalent of the original. A prophet is one who has "listened in the council of God" (<a href="/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, corrected version; comp. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>), and "when the Lord Jehovah hath spoken, who can but prophesy?" (<a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>). Prophetic perception of Divine truth is so exceptional a thing that it can only be expressed approximately in terms of everyday life. One while it may be called a "hearing," a "report," another while a "vision" or "intuition." He who makes to hear or see is, of course, Jehovah, through the objective influence of his Spirit. It is important to study the Biblical phraseology, which has a depth of meaning too often overlooked, owing to the blunter edge which time has given to our modern speech. <span class="cmt_word">An ambassador;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a herald.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Unto the heathen;</span> rather, unto <span class="accented">the nations.</span> There is no religious idea involved; the word <span class="accented">goyim</span> literally means "nations," and there is no reason for deviating from the primary sense.
