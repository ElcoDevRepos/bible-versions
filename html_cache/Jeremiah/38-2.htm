In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet often begins his declarations with this phrase to assert that the message is not his own but from God. This underscores the role of prophets as messengers of God's will, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Whoever stays in this city will die by sword and famine and plague:</b><br>Jeremiah is speaking about Jerusalem during the Babylonian siege. The triad of sword, famine, and plague is a common biblical motif representing comprehensive judgment (see <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>). Historically, sieges often led to these conditions as the besieged city was cut off from supplies. This warning reflects the dire situation in Jerusalem and serves as a call to heed God's warning.<p><b>But whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live:</b><br>The Chaldeans, another name for the Babylonians, were the dominant power at the time. This statement is counterintuitive to the nationalistic hopes of Judah, as surrendering to a foreign power was seen as defeat. However, Jeremiah's message is one of survival through submission to God's plan, even if it means surrendering to enemies. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where true life is found in obedience to God's will, even when it seems contrary to human wisdom.<p><b>He will retain his life like a spoil of war:</b><br>The imagery of life as a spoil of war suggests that survival itself is a victory. In ancient warfare, spoils were the rewards of victory. Here, the reward is life, emphasizing the value of life over national pride or resistance. This phrase also highlights the mercy of God, offering a way of escape amidst judgment.<p><b>And he will live:</b><br>The repetition of the promise of life underscores its certainty and importance. In the broader biblical narrative, life is often associated with obedience to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>). This promise of life through surrender can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers eternal life through surrender to Him (<a href="/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a>). The assurance of life for those who heed God's warning is a testament to His faithfulness and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Similar prophetic formulas appear throughout Scripture&#8212;&#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>)&#8212;reminding hearers that obedience to the message equals obedience to God Himself (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever stays in this city will die by sword and famine and plague,</b><p>Jerusalem&#8217;s citizens face three literal judgments:<p>&#8226; Sword&#8212;Babylon&#8217;s armies (<a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-9.htm">Ezekiel 21:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Famine&#8212;siege conditions cutting off supplies (<a href="/2_kings/25-2.htm">2 Kings 25:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Plague&#8212;disease following war and starvation (<a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25-26</a>).<p>These are covenant curses spelled out in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.

Submission to Babylon equals submission to God&#8217;s discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a>). Just as Naaman had to wash in the Jordan despite pride (<a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10-14</a>), Judah must embrace humbling obedience to survive. This is not treason; it is trust in God&#8217;s word over human security (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will retain his life like a spoil of war,</b><p>Though captives may lose homes, status, or wealth, their lives become the only &#8220;plunder&#8221; they carry away (<a href="/jeremiah/39-18.htm">Jeremiah 39:18</a>; 45:5). In wartime imagery, life itself is the prize rescued from destruction. Jesus echoes the thought: &#8220;What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he will live.</b><p>The promise ends where it began: life. God&#8217;s heart is for repentance, not ruin (<a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>). Choosing His way yields survival now and positions the remnant for future hope (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>; <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).

Choosing His word over human wisdom is the only way to live.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Thus saith the Lord.</span>--The words carry us back to <a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm" title="He that stays in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.">Jeremiah 21:9</a>, and in any chronological arrangement of the book the one chapter would follow the other. It is obvious that to all who did not recognise the divine mission of the prophet, words like those which he had then spoken would seem to come from the lips of a traitor. Desertion to the enemy was represented as the only way of safety, and this was the counsel given to those who were defending the city of their fathers against an alien invader. What made it appear worse was that the prophet himself had been caught in an act which, though he denied the charge, might not unnaturally seem like an act of treacherous desertion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that remaineth,</span> etc. Jeremiah repeats what he had said to Zedekiah's embassy in <a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9, 10</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/38-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Whoever stays</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
