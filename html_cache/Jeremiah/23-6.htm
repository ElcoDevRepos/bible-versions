The "days" signify a specific era of divine intervention and fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<p><b>Judah will be saved</b><br>The salvation of Judah indicates a restoration and deliverance from both physical and spiritual adversities. Historically, Judah faced numerous threats from surrounding nations, and this promise assures them of divine protection and redemption. This salvation is also seen as a type of the ultimate salvation brought by Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin.<p><b>and Israel will dwell securely</b><br>The unification of Judah and Israel under a single, peaceful rule is a significant theme. This security implies not only freedom from external threats but also internal peace and prosperity. It reflects the prophetic vision of a restored Israel living in harmony, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>And this is His name by which He will be called: The LORD Our Righteousness</b><br>This name signifies the character and mission of the Messiah. "The LORD Our Righteousness" emphasizes that righteousness is not achieved by human effort but is a divine gift.

There it is clearly not, in logical language, the predicate of the city, but that which she takes as her watchword, and blazons, as it were, on her banner; and we cannot consistently press more than that meaning here. So in <a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm" title="It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.">Ezekiel 48:35</a> the new name of Jerusalem is "Jehovah-shammah" (<span class= "ital">= </span>the Lord is there). So in <a href="/exodus/17-15.htm" title="And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:">Exodus 17:15</a> Moses calls the altar which he builds "Jehovah-nissi" (= the Lord is my banner). The interpretation which sees in the words (1) the identification of the Messianic King with Jehovah, the Eternal, and (2) the doctrine of imputed righteousness, must accordingly be regarded as one of the applications of the words rather than their direct meaning. That meaning would seem to be that the King, the righteous Branch, will look to Jehovah as giving and working righteousness. Some commentators, indeed, refer the pronoun "he" to Israel, and not to the righteous Branch. We cannot forget that, at the very time when Jeremiah uttered this prophecy, a king was on the throne whose name (Zedekiah = righteous is Jehovah) implied the same thought. His reign had been a miserable failure, and the prophet looks forward to a time when the ideal, which was then far off, should at last be realised. If with many critics we refer the prediction to the reign of Jehoiakim (see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm" title="Woe be to the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:1</a>), we might almost see in Mattaniah's adoption of the new name a boast that he was about to fulfil it. The Christ, we may say, answered to the name, not as being Himself one with Jehovah, though He was that, but as doing the Father's will, and so fulfilling all righteousness (comp. <a href="/matthew/3-15.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.">Matthew 3:15</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel shall dwell safely</span>. In the parallel passage (<a href="/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>) we read "Jerusalem," and there can hardly be a doubt that "Jerusalem" ought to be restored here. This is not the-only instance in which, by mistake, the scribe has written "Israel" instead of "Jerusalem" (see <a href="/jeremiah/32-30.htm">Jeremiah 32:30, 32</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-49.htm">Jeremiah 51:49</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>). In <a href="/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a> the scribe discovered his mistake, and wrote the right word, "Jerusalem," after the wrong one, "Israel," but without canceling the latter (Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' 1880, pp. 97-101). <span class="cmt_word">And this is his name whereby he shall be called</span>. There is a various reading, which may be rendered either, <span class="accented">whereby they shall call</span> (<span class="accented">him</span>, or her), or, <span class="accented">which they shall proclaim</span>, supported by the Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, and a few manuscripts (St. Jerome, too, mentions this reading). There is also a more important difference among the commentators as to the person who was to bear the name. The older Christian interpreters contended with all their might for the view that the name belonged to the Messiah, partly on real philological grounds, partly with the illegitimate theological object of obtaining a proof-text for the orthodox doctrine of the person of the Messiah and (in the case of Protestant writers) of justification. It is much to the credit of Hengstenberg that he sets this object aside, and while maintaining the Messianic reference of the pronoun interprets the name with a single eye to the requirements of the context, "He by whom and under whom Jehovah will be our righteousness." The objection is that in the parallel passage (<a href="/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>) Jeremiah assigns the name "Jehovah-Tsidkenu," not to the Messiah, but to Jerusalem. The prophet must be allowed to be his best interpreter, so that we must, it would seem, at any rate, reject the Messianic reference. But then how are we to explain the pronoun? It is right to refer the parallel pronoun in <a href="/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> to "Jerusalem," because the pronoun there is feminine, and evidently refers to a city, but it is not natural in our passage to explain "his name" of "Israel," seeing that the subject of the noun in the parallel line is, not Israel, but the Messiah. is the text here correct? A comparison of the parallel psalms Psalms 14 and Psalms 53, and of the corresponding chapters in Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, will show how easily errors made their way into duplicate copies of the same passage. Granting that we have such duplicate copies of this prophecy in Jeremiah, there can be no doubt which is the more original; the form of <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> has a difficulty from which <a href="/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> is free - a difficulty of interpretation and a difficulty also of grammar. For, as Ewald has already pointed out ('Hebrew Grammar,' &sect; 249 b), the contracted suffix is very rarely attached to the simple imperfect, and the clear style in which this section is written justifies us in regarding any unusual form with suspicion. "Israel" thus was probably written by mistake for "Jerusalem," and this error soon led to others - first, the omission of "her," and then the prefixing of "his name" for clearness, and (on the part of the authors of the points) the mispointing of the verb (so as to include in the form the pronoun "him"). It is some confirmation of this view that there are several other passages in which the words "Israel" and "Jerusalem" appear to have been confounded (see preceding note). Read, therefore, as in <a href="/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>, And this is <span class="accented">the name wherewith she shall be called</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">Yahveh</span> (Jehovah) <span class="accented">Tsidkenu</span>. The name is formed on the analogy of other symbolic names, such as El-elohe-Israel (<a href="/genesis/33-20.htm">Genesis 33:20</a>), Jehovah-Nisei (<a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a> ), and especially Jehovah-Shammah (<a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>), also a name of Jerusalem. These names are, in fact, sentences; Jehovah-Shammah, for instance, means "The Lord (is) there;" and the name in the present verse, "The Lord (is) our Righteousness" (Hengstenberg's view mentioned above seems less natural). It is singular that Zedekiah's name should come so near to that announced by the prophet. But there is still a difference between them. Zedekiah must mean "The Lord (is) righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is ever faithful to his revealed principles of action. But Jehovah-Tsidkenu may be correctly paraphrased, "The Lord is the author of our <span class="accented">prosperity</span>," or, more strictly, "of the justification of our claims in the sight of our enemies" (comp. <a href="/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-8.htm">Isaiah 50:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1, 2</a>). Similar applications of forensic language are familiar, e.g. "When they speak with their enemies in the gate" (<a href="/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In His days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
