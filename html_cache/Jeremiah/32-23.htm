This fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) demonstrates God's faithfulness. The conquest of Canaan was a significant event in Israel's history, marking the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to settling in a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). Archaeological evidence, such as the destruction layers in cities like Jericho and Hazor, supports the biblical account of the conquest.<p><b>but they did not obey Your voice or walk in Your law</b><br>Despite receiving the land, the Israelites failed to remain faithful to God's covenant. This disobedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting Israel's spiritual adultery and idolatry (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-15</a>). The law, given through Moses, was intended to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). Their failure to obey God's voice and law led to a cycle of sin, judgment, repentance, and deliverance, as seen throughout the book of Judges.<p><b>They failed to perform all that You commanded them to do</b><br>This phrase underscores Israel's incomplete obedience. The Israelites were commanded to fully drive out the inhabitants of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>), but they often compromised, leading to the influence of pagan practices and idolatry (<a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27-36</a>). This partial obedience is a warning against complacency and the dangers of syncretism, where the worship of Yahweh was mixed with Canaanite religious practices.<p><b>and so You have brought upon them all this disaster</b><br>The disaster refers to the consequences of Israel's disobedience, including invasions, exile, and suffering. Jeremiah prophesied during a time when Judah faced the Babylonian threat, culminating in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. This disaster was a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>. It serves as a sobering reminder of God's justice and the seriousness of sin. However, it also points to the hope of restoration and the coming of a new covenant, as prophesied later in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given the Promised Land but failed to obey God's commands, leading to their downfall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

God had fully kept His promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by bringing Israel into the land &#8220;He had sworn to give their fathers&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43</a>). The people enjoyed cities they had not built and vineyards they had not planted, exactly as <a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10&#8211;11</a> foretold. The verse reminds us that every square foot of Canaan was a gift, not a conquest earned by Israel&#8217;s prowess (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>). Possession, however, was only the beginning of covenant life, not the end of responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they did not obey Your voice</b><p>In spite of receiving the land, &#8220;they did not obey Your voice.&#8221; God&#8217;s voice had thundered from Sinai, had been echoed by prophets, and was written plainly in the Book of the Law (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1&#8211;2</a>). Yet the nation treated divine commands as background noise.

Instead, Israel&#8217;s spiritual gait meandered. Idols cropped up on high places (<a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9&#8211;12</a>). Justice was ignored in the gates (<a href="/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10&#8211;12</a>). Walking in God&#8217;s law would have distinguished them from their neighbors and drawn those neighbors to the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>), but Israel chose a detour that led them away from fellowship and blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They failed to perform all that You commanded them to do</b><p>Partial obedience cascaded into outright failure. <a href="/judges/2-2.htm">Judges 2:2&#8211;3</a> notes they never fully drove out the Canaanite nations; those lingering influences became snares. <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a> later underscores the same principle: stumble in one point, and the whole law is violated. Israel&#8217;s story testifies that God measures faithfulness by wholehearted conformity, not selective compliance (<a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and so You have brought upon them all this disaster</b><p>Covenant blessing and covenant curse were two sides of the same coin (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). The Babylonian siege surrounding Jeremiah proved God keeps His warnings as reliably as His promises (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-18</a>). <a href="/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8-9</a> mourns that Jerusalem&#8217;s downfall was self-inflicted; the Lord&#8217;s justice was not arbitrary but perfectly righteous.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/32-23.htm">Jeremiah 32:23</a> compresses Israel&#8217;s history into one sobering sentence: God faithfully fulfilled His promise by giving the land, yet His people unfaithfully ignored His voice, neglected His law, and failed to do what He commanded. Consequently, He faithfully executed the covenant judgments He had warned about. The verse calls us to remember that divine blessing never nullifies divine holiness&#8212;grace received must be matched by obedience rendered.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/32-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They came in</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1436;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
