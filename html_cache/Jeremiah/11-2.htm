In the biblical context, a covenant is a solemn agreement between God and His people, often involving promises and obligations. The covenant referred to here likely alludes to the Mosaic Covenant, which includes the laws and commandments given to Israel at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-24). Listening implies obedience and a heart inclined towards God's will, a recurring theme in the prophetic literature (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>).<p><b>and tell them to the men of Judah</b><br>Jeremiah's audience is specifically the people of Judah, the southern kingdom of Israel. Historically, Judah was the remaining kingdom after the division of Israel following Solomon's reign. The men of Judah are called to remember and adhere to the covenant, as they are the descendants of those who originally received it. This call to remembrance is crucial, as Judah is facing impending judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry (2 Kings 22-23).<p><b>and the residents of Jerusalem.</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital city of Judah, holds significant religious and political importance. It is the location of the Temple, the center of Jewish worship and the symbol of God's presence among His people. The residents of Jerusalem are particularly accountable, as they live in the heart of the nation's spiritual life. The call to the residents underscores the urgency of returning to covenant faithfulness, as Jerusalem would soon face destruction due to the people's persistent sin (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

To whom is this addressed? To Jeremiah and his disciples. The Septuagint, indeed, followed by Hitzig and Graf, read (instead of "speak ye"), "Thou shalt speak unto them," adopting one different vowel-point. But this involves an inconsistency with the first verb, and is not at all necessary, for why should we suppose Jeremiah to have been completely isolated? If the prophet had well-wishers even among the princes, it stands to reason that he must have had more pronounced adherents in the classes less influenced by the prejudices of society. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/11-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Listen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1429;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#7687;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1465;&#1425;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
