Historically, the division of the united monarchy occurred after Solomon's reign, leading to separate paths of idolatry and rebellion against God. The "evil" refers to their persistent idolatry, social injustice, and failure to uphold the covenant with God. This provocation is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where God&#8217;s patience is tested by the people's continuous disobedience.<p><b>they, their kings, their officials, their priests and prophets</b><br>This enumeration underscores the widespread nature of the sin, implicating every level of society. The kings, often seen as the leaders responsible for guiding the nation in righteousness, frequently led the people astray, as seen in the accounts of kings like Manasseh and Ahab. The officials, or government leaders, were complicit in corrupt practices. The priests and prophets, who were supposed to be spiritual leaders, often failed in their duties, either by endorsing false worship or by remaining silent. This mirrors the condemnation found in other prophetic books, such as Ezekiel and Hosea, where religious leaders are criticized for their failures.<p><b>the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem</b><br>This phrase specifies the southern kingdom and its capital, Jerusalem, as centers of this rebellion. Jerusalem held the temple, the central place of worship, making its residents' sins particularly grievous. The mention of "men of Judah" and "residents of Jerusalem" emphasizes that the problem was not just with the leaders but also with the general populace. This reflects the broader biblical narrative where the entire community is held accountable for collective sin, as seen in the stories of Sodom and Gomorrah or the generation of the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_israel_and_judah.htm">People of Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The collective group of God's chosen people who have turned away from Him, engaging in practices that provoke His anger.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_and_officials.htm">Kings and Officials</a></b><br>The leaders of Israel and Judah who have led the people astray through their actions and policies, failing to uphold God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_prophets.htm">Priests and Prophets</a></b><br>Religious leaders who were supposed to guide the people in spiritual matters but instead contributed to their rebellion against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_judah.htm">Men of Judah</a></b><br>The male population of Judah, representing the broader community involved in the nation's sins.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/residents_of_jerusalem.htm">Residents of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the capital city, a central place of worship and governance, who have also participated in the nation's disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_leadership_failure.htm">The Consequences of Leadership Failure</a></b><br>Leaders hold significant responsibility in guiding their people.
