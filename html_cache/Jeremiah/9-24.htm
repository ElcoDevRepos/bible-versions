In the biblical context, boasting is often associated with human arrogance and self-reliance, which God opposes (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). Here, the call is to redirect any boasting away from personal achievements or wisdom, as seen earlier in <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>, and towards a relationship with God. This aligns with the biblical theme that true wisdom and strength come from God alone (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>).<p><b>that he understands and knows Me,</b><br>Understanding and knowing God is presented as the ultimate goal and source of true wisdom. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational, involving a deep, personal relationship with God. The Hebrew words for "understands" (sakal) and "knows" (yada) imply insight and intimate acquaintance. This echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which calls for loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength, indicating a comprehensive and devoted relationship.<p><b>that I am the LORD,</b><br>The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies God's covenant name, highlighting His eternal, self-existent nature and His faithfulness to His promises. This is the same name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>, underscoring God's unchanging character and His role as the covenant-keeping God of Israel. Recognizing God as LORD is central to understanding His authority and sovereignty.<p><b>who exercises loving devotion,</b><br>"Loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," which encompasses steadfast love, mercy, and covenant faithfulness. This attribute of God is foundational to His interactions with humanity, as seen in His enduring commitment to Israel despite their unfaithfulness (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). It is also a type of Christ, who embodies God's chesed through His sacrificial love and redemption (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>justice and righteousness on the earth&#8212;</b><br>Justice (mishpat) and righteousness (tsedaqah) are key aspects of God's character and His expectations for human conduct. These terms are often paired in Scripture to describe God's rule and the ideal social order (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>). They reflect God's concern for fairness, equity, and moral integrity, which He desires to see manifested in human society. The prophets frequently called Israel to uphold these values (<a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>).<p><b>for I delight in these things,&#8221;</b><br>God's delight in loving devotion, justice, and righteousness reveals His values and priorities. This delight indicates that these attributes are not only His nature but also what He desires to see reflected in His people. The concept of God taking pleasure in righteousness is echoed in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, where God outlines what He requires of humanity.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "declares the LORD" underscores the authority and certainty of the message. It is a prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to affirm that the words spoken are directly from God. This declaration invites the audience to respond with reverence and obedience, recognizing the divine origin and importance of the message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, to whom Jeremiah primarily prophesied, warning them of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The event during which the people of Judah were taken captive by Babylon, a consequence of their disobedience, which Jeremiah prophesied.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_context.htm">Prophetic Context</a></b><br>Jeremiah's ministry occurred during a time of great turmoil and impending judgment, calling the people back to a true understanding and relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_and_knowing_god.htm">Understanding and Knowing God</a></b><br>The highest pursuit for a believer is to understand and know God personally.

He had learnt from it to estimate the wisdom and the greatness on which the Corinthians prided themselves at their true value. We may find a parallel even in the higher words which teach us that "eternal life is to know God" (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>), to understand those attributes, love, judgment, righteousness, which we associate with our thoughts of Him, as indeed they are in their infinite perfection, and which when we know them as we ought to know, we must needs strive to reproduce.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The knowledge of God relates to three leading attributes, the combination of which is very instructive. <span class="cmt_word">First, loving-kindness.</span> This is not to be understood in a vague and general sense of the love of God to all mankind; the term has a special connotation with regard to the Israelitish people. God shows loving-kindness to those with whom he is in covenant; hence the combination "loving-kindness and faithfulness" (<a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>, corrected version), and as here (comp. <a href="/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7, 8</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5, 6</a>), "mercy and righteousness." Israel is weak and erring, and needs mercies of all sorts, which Jehovah, in his "loving-kindness," vouchsafes. <span class="cmt_word">Next, judgment, or justice.</span> Jehovah is a King, helps the poor and weak to their right, and punishes the wrong-doer (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>). Then, <span class="cmt_word">righteousness</span> - a similar but wider term. This is the quality which leads its subject to adhere to a fixed rule of conduct. God's rule is his covenant; hence "righteousness" shows itself in all such acts as tend to the full realizing of the covenant with Israel, including the "plan of salvation." It is by no means to be confined to exacting penalties and conferring rewards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">let him who boasts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7791;&#183;hal&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1984.htm">Strong's 1984: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">boast</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mi&#7791;&#183;hal&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
