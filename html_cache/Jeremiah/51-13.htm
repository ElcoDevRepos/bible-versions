The abundance of water contributed to Babylon's prosperity and strategic importance. In biblical symbolism, "many waters" often represent nations or peoples (<a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17:1, 15</a>). Babylon's location and resources made it a powerful empire, but also a target for divine judgment.<p><b>rich in treasures</b><br>Babylon was known for its wealth and opulence, accumulated through conquest and trade. The city's riches are mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a> and <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11-13</a>, where Babylon is depicted as a center of commerce and luxury. This wealth, however, became a source of pride and idolatry, leading to its downfall as prophesied by Jeremiah.<p><b>your end has come</b><br>This prophecy foretells the imminent destruction of Babylon. Historically, Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians in 539 BC, fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecy. The phrase underscores the certainty of God's judgment against nations that oppose His will. It serves as a reminder of the temporal nature of earthly power and wealth.<p><b>the thread of your life is cut</b><br>This imagery suggests the sudden and irreversible nature of Babylon's demise. The metaphor of a "thread" being cut is reminiscent of the fragility of life and the sovereignty of God over human affairs. Similar imagery is found in <a href="/job/6-9.htm">Job 6:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>, emphasizing the finality of divine judgment. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment of all nations, as seen in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon's fall is depicted as part of God's eschatological plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, Babylon was a powerful empire known for its wealth and influence.
