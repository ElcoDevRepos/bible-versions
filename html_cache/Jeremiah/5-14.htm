The title "LORD God of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, reflecting His ultimate authority and ability to execute judgment. This title is often used in contexts where God's power and majesty are highlighted, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a> and <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>.<p><b>Because you have spoken this word:</b><br>This refers to the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, who faithfully delivered God's message to the people of Judah. The context is one of warning and impending judgment due to the people's persistent disobedience and idolatry. Jeremiah's role as a prophet is to convey God's truth, regardless of the people's response, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7-9</a>.<p><b>I will make My words a fire in your mouth:</b><br>Here, God's words are likened to a fire, symbolizing their power to purify, judge, and consume. Fire is a common biblical metaphor for God's presence and judgment, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>. This imagery indicates that Jeremiah's prophetic words will have a powerful and undeniable impact, burning away falsehood and sin.<p><b>and this people the wood it consumes:</b><br>The people of Judah are compared to wood, which is easily consumed by fire. This metaphor highlights their vulnerability to God's judgment due to their spiritual and moral decay. The imagery of wood being consumed by fire illustrates the inevitability and thoroughness of the coming judgment, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/15-6.htm">Ezekiel 15:6-7</a>.

The leaders and people have stubbornly refused God&#8217;s calls to repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23</a>). &#8220;Therefore&#8221; signals that the time for patient pleading has ended, and the time for decisive action has arrived, much like the moment in <a href="/jeremiah/4-18.htm">Jeremiah 4:18</a> when God says, &#8220;Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you.&#8221; The cause-and-effect relationship is unmistakable: persistent rebellion inevitably invites divine response (<a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>; <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is what the LORD God of Hosts says</b><p>The title &#8220;LORD God of Hosts&#8221; underscores both the covenant name (Yahweh) and His command over angelic armies. The same phrase in <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/10-16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a> reminds Israel that the One speaking is unconquerable. Whatever comfort the people might draw from their alliances or fortified cities evaporates, because ultimate authority rests with the LORD who commands heaven&#8217;s hosts (<a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because you have spoken this word</b><p>Jeremiah has faithfully proclaimed God&#8217;s message despite ridicule and danger (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7&#8211;9</a>; 26:12&#8211;15). His obedience contrasts sharply with the false prophets who peddled soothing lies (<a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>; 6:14). The phrase also affirms the prophet&#8217;s inspiration: Jeremiah&#8217;s words are, in fact, God&#8217;s words (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). When a servant delivers the Lord&#8217;s message accurately, heaven stands behind every syllable (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will make My words a fire in your mouth</b><p>Fire purifies, illuminates, and destroys. In <a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a> God asks, &#8220;Is not My word like fire&#8230;?&#8221; Here He turns that metaphor into a promise of irresistible power:<p>&#8226; Purifying fire &#8212; exposing sin and calling for holiness (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Illumining fire &#8212; showing the true state of hearts (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>; <a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Consuming fire &#8212; executing judgment on hardened rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p>The emphasis is not on Jeremiah&#8217;s eloquence but on God&#8217;s burning truth that will scorch everything false.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And this people the wood it consumes</b><p>Wood has no defense against flame; it simply burns. By calling the people &#8220;wood,&#8221; God pronounces an ominous verdict: their unrepentant hearts make them fuel for the very word they despise (<a href="/isaiah/1-31.htm">Isaiah 1:31</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). The picture is corporate as well as individual: the nation&#8217;s collective sin readies it for sweeping judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>). Yet even here, God&#8217;s purpose is not wanton destruction but righteous justice that clears the way for future restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a> reveals a solemn transaction: the prophet&#8217;s faithful proclamation becomes a fiery instrument of God&#8217;s judgment, while the people who reject that message become its fuel. The verse teaches that divine authority stands behind Scripture, that truth has purifying and consuming power, and that persistent unbelief inevitably invites judgment.
