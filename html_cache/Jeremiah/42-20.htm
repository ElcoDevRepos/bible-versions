In the broader context of <a href="/jeremiah/42.htm">Jeremiah 42</a>, the remnant of Judah seeks guidance from God through the prophet Jeremiah. However, their hearts are not truly aligned with God's will. This self-deception is a common theme in Scripture, where individuals or groups claim to seek God's guidance but are unwilling to follow it when it contradicts their desires (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-24</a>).<p><b>by sending me to the LORD your God</b><br>Jeremiah is acting as an intermediary between the people and God, a common role for prophets in the Old Testament. This reflects the people's recognition of Jeremiah's prophetic authority, yet their actions reveal a lack of genuine faith. The phrase "the LORD your God" indicates a personal relationship that the people are supposed to have with God, yet their actions suggest otherwise.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Pray to the LORD our God on our behalf</b><br>The people request intercession, acknowledging their need for divine guidance. This reflects a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament, where leaders and prophets intercede for the people (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). However, their request is insincere, as their subsequent actions reveal a predetermined decision to go to Egypt, contrary to God's will.<p><b>and as for all that the LORD our God says, tell it to us</b><br>This phrase indicates a willingness to hear God's word, yet it is superficial. The people express a desire to know God's will, but their hearts are not truly open to it. This mirrors the parable of the sower in the New Testament, where some hear the word but do not let it take root (<a href="/matthew/13-20.htm">Matthew 13:20-21</a>).<p><b>and we will do it</b><br>The people make a commitment to obey God's instructions, yet their actions later prove otherwise. This reflects a recurring biblical theme of lip service without true obedience (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>). It serves as a warning against making vows to God without the intention of fulfilling them, emphasizing the importance of genuine faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
