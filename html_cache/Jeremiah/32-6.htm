His role as a prophet was to communicate God's will, often in times of crisis. This phrase indicates that Jeremiah is responding, likely to a question or situation that required divine insight. His response is not based on personal opinion but on a revelation from God.<p><b>The word of the LORD came to me</b><br>This phrase signifies divine revelation, a common occurrence in the prophetic books of the Bible. The "word of the LORD" is a technical term used to describe a direct communication from God to His prophets. It underscores the authority and authenticity of the message. In the context of Jeremiah, this often involved messages of warning, judgment, or hope. The phrase also highlights the personal relationship between God and His prophets, as God chooses to reveal His plans and purposes to them.<p><b>Saying:</b><br>The colon indicates that what follows is the content of God's message. This sets the stage for a specific instruction or prophecy. In the broader context of <a href="/jeremiah/32.htm">Jeremiah 32</a>, the message involves a symbolic act of purchasing land, which serves as a sign of hope and future restoration for Israel. This act is significant because it occurs during a time of impending judgment and exile, demonstrating God's long-term plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction and eventual restoration of Jerusalem.
