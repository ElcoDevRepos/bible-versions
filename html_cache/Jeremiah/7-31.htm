Topheth, located in the Valley of Ben-hinnom, was notorious for its association with child sacrifice, particularly to the god Molech. This practice was strictly condemned in the Law of Moses (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). The construction of these high places indicates a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh, reflecting the influence of surrounding pagan cultures.<p><b>in the Valley of Ben-hinnom</b><br>The Valley of Ben-hinnom, located south of Jerusalem, became synonymous with idolatry and abomination due to the practices conducted there. It later became a symbol of divine judgment and was referred to as Gehenna in the New Testament, representing hell or the place of final punishment (<a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>). The valley's historical and geographical significance underscores the severity of the Israelites' apostasy.<p><b>so they could burn their sons and daughters in the fire</b><br>This phrase highlights the horrific practice of child sacrifice, which was an abomination to God. Such acts were influenced by Canaanite religious practices and were a direct violation of God's commandments. The burning of children was seen as the ultimate expression of idolatry and rebellion against God, demonstrating the depth of Israel's spiritual corruption.<p><b>something I never commanded</b><br>God's laws, as given through Moses, explicitly forbade child sacrifice and any form of human sacrifice (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>). This phrase emphasizes that such practices were not only unauthorized but also completely contrary to God's character and will. It underscores the distinction between the true worship of Yahweh and the detestable practices of the surrounding nations.<p><b>nor did it even enter My mind</b><br>This expression indicates the utter foreignness of such practices to God's nature and intentions. It serves to highlight the gravity of Israel's sin and the extent to which they had strayed from God's covenant. The phrase also underscores the concept of God's holiness and the expectation of His people to reflect His character, contrasting sharply with the abominable acts committed in Topheth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
