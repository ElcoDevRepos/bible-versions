It signals an impending event that is certain to occur, as it is decreed by God Himself. The phrase "the days are coming" is often used in prophetic literature to indicate a future time when God's plans will be fulfilled. This assurance of divine intervention is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, emphasizing God's sovereignty over history.<p><b>when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites</b><br>Rabbah was the capital city of the Ammonites, located in present-day Jordan. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel. The "battle cry" signifies a divine call to war, indicating that God Himself is orchestrating the judgment against Rabbah. This reflects the biblical theme of God as a warrior who fights for His people and executes judgment on their enemies. The Ammonites' hostility towards Israel is documented in several biblical passages, including <a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10</a>.<p><b>It will become a heap of ruins, and its villages will be burned</b><br>This prophecy foretells the complete destruction of Rabbah and its surrounding settlements. The imagery of a "heap of ruins" and "villages burned" conveys total devastation, a common outcome for cities under divine judgment in the Old Testament. Archaeological evidence supports the historical reality of such destruction in ancient Near Eastern warfare. This judgment serves as a warning to nations opposing God's people, illustrating the consequences of defying His will.<p><b>Then Israel will drive out their dispossessors, says the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates a reversal of fortunes for Israel. The "dispossessors" are those who have taken land or rights from Israel, and the prophecy promises their removal. This reflects the covenantal promise of land to Israel, a central theme in the Old Testament. The restoration of Israel's territory is a recurring prophetic promise, symbolizing God's faithfulness to His covenant. This also foreshadows the ultimate victory and restoration that believers anticipate in the eschatological fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who declares judgment and restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabbah.htm">Rabbah</a></b><br>The capital city of the Ammonites, located east of the Jordan River, known for its strength and fortifications.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ammonites.htm">The Ammonites</a></b><br>A people descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel, representing opposition to God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are promised restoration and victory over their enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle_cry.htm">Battle Cry</a></b><br>A divine call to war, symbolizing God's intervention and judgment against the Ammonites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of the nations and their destinies.
