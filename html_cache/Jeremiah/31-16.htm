It is a common introduction in prophetic literature, indicating that the following words are not merely human opinion but a direct communication from God. This establishes the importance and reliability of the message.<p><b>Keep your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears,</b><br>The call to cease weeping suggests a transition from mourning to hope. In the context of Jeremiah, this is significant as the people of Israel were experiencing exile and suffering. The instruction to stop crying implies that God is about to bring a change in their circumstances. This echoes other biblical instances where God promises comfort, such as in <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>.<p><b>for the reward for your work will come, declares the LORD.</b><br>This promise of a reward indicates that the efforts and faithfulness of the people, despite their current hardships, will not be in vain. It suggests a future restoration and blessing. The concept of divine reward is consistent with other scriptures, such as <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which speaks of God rewarding those who earnestly seek Him.<p><b>Then your children will return from the land of the enemy.</b><br>This phrase speaks to the hope of restoration and return from exile. Historically, the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, and this promise would have been a source of great hope for them. The return from the land of the enemy can also be seen as a type of spiritual restoration, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Christ, who delivers from the bondage of sin. This theme of return and restoration is echoed in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Jeremiah to deliver messages of both warning and comfort.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jeremiah's prophecies, who were experiencing exile and suffering due to their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_the_enemy.htm">The Land of the Enemy</a></b><br>Refers to the places of exile where the Israelites were taken, such as Babylon, symbolizing separation from their homeland and God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>The promise of restoration and return from exile, symbolizing hope and future redemption for the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_comfort_in_sorrow.htm">God's Comfort in Sorrow</a></b><br>The Lord acknowledges the pain and sorrow of His people but promises a future where tears will be wiped away.

Rachel, personifying the northern kingdom, perhaps even the collective unity of all Israel, is thought of as labouring in the work of repentance and reformation, as with a mother's care, and is comforted with the thought that her labour shall not be in vain. This seems a more satisfactory interpretation than that which refers the "work" of the weeping Rachel to the travail of child-birth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Rachel is admonished to cease from weeping, because her work has not really been in vain; her children shall be restored. <span class="cmt_word">Thy work shall be rewarded.</span> Like the Servant of the Lord, Rachel had said (though with the voiceless language of tears), "I have laboured in vain; I have spent my strength for nought and in vain;" and like the ocean mother of Zidon, "I have not travailed, nor brought forth children, neither nourished up young men, nor brought up virgins" (<a href="/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>).
