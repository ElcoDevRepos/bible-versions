The concept of cleansing is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where ceremonial washings were required for purification (<a href="/leviticus/16-30.htm">Leviticus 16:30</a>). The cleansing here is spiritual, indicating a removal of sin's defilement. This promise is significant in the context of the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites' sins had led to their captivity. The cleansing foreshadows the New Covenant, where Jesus' sacrifice provides ultimate purification (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). The use of "all the iniquity" underscores the completeness of God's forgiveness, aligning with passages like <a href="/psalms/51-2.htm">Psalm 51:2</a>, where David seeks total cleansing from sin.<p><b>and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against Me</b><br>Forgiveness is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting God's mercy and grace. The term "rebellion" highlights the Israelites' deliberate disobedience and idolatry, which were key reasons for their exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>). This forgiveness is not just a pardon but a restoration of the relationship between God and His people. It points to the prophetic hope of a renewed covenant, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, where God promises to remember their sins no more. This act of divine forgiveness is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who offers redemption and reconciliation (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The phrase assures believers of God's willingness to forgive and restore those who turn back to Him in repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
