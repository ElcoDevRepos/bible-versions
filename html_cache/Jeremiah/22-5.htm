The call to obedience is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, highlighting the importance of adhering to God's commands. In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet is addressing the leaders of Judah, urging them to follow God's laws to avoid impending judgment. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience.<p><b>then I swear by Myself,</b><br>God swearing by Himself underscores the seriousness and certainty of His declaration. In ancient times, oaths were sworn by something greater than oneself, but since there is none greater than God, He swears by His own name. This is similar to <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>, where God swears by Himself to Abraham, emphasizing the unchangeable nature of His promises.<p><b>declares the LORD,</b><br>The use of "declares the LORD" signifies the authoritative and prophetic nature of the message. It is a common phrase in prophetic literature, indicating that the message is not from the prophet's own mind but directly from God. This adds weight to the warning and assures the audience of its divine origin.<p><b>that this house will become a pile of rubble.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The "house" refers to the royal palace or possibly the temple in Jerusalem, symbolizing the center of Judah's political and religious life. The imagery of becoming "a pile of rubble" is a vivid depiction of total destruction, which historically came to pass with the Babylonian conquest in 586 BC. This prophecy serves as a warning of the consequences of disobedience, similar to the fate of Shiloh mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12-14</a>. The destruction also prefigures the ultimate judgment and the need for a new covenant, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The kings of Judah were expected to lead in righteousness, yet they and the people persisted in injustice and idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then I swear by Myself, declares the LORD</b><p>&#8226; No higher authority exists, so God takes an oath by His own name (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This underscores the certainty of the coming judgment; it is not a mere possibility but a divine guarantee.<p>&#8226; The personal declaration &#8220;declares the LORD&#8221; stresses that the prophet is not speaking his own ideas&#8212;this is God&#8217;s unchangeable word (<a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That this house will become a pile of rubble</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;This house&#8221; points first to the royal palace complex that overlooked Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/22-4.htm">Jeremiah 22:4</a>).
