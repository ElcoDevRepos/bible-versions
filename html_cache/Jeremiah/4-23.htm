In Jeremiah's context, this imagery is used to depict the desolation and chaos that would result from God's judgment on Judah due to their persistent sin and rebellion. The prophet Jeremiah is conveying a vision of the earth reverting to a state of chaos, symbolizing the undoing of creation as a consequence of divine wrath. This serves as a stark warning to the people of Judah about the seriousness of their spiritual condition and the impending disaster if they do not repent. The use of this phrase also highlights the power of God to both create and dismantle, emphasizing His sovereignty over all creation.<p><b>I looked to the heavens, and they had no light.</b><br>The absence of light in the heavens signifies a withdrawal of God's presence and favor, as light is often associated with God's glory and guidance (e.g., <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). In the prophetic literature, darkness is frequently a metaphor for judgment and calamity (e.g., <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18-20</a>, <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>). The imagery of darkened heavens suggests a cosmic upheaval, reflecting the severity of the judgment that is to come. This darkness can also be seen as a reversal of the creation order, where God initially brought light into the world (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>). Theologically, this points to the consequences of sin, which brings spiritual darkness and separation from God. The phrase underscores the seriousness of turning away from God and the resulting loss of His illuminating presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Formlessness, emptiness, and darkness testify that sin invites God&#8217;s righteous un-creation. Yet behind the gloom stands a God who once spoke light into being; His power to judge also means He can recreate.

The prophet is again the speaker, but in a calmer mood. God's judgment has been pronounced, and it is not for him to rebel. He has now simply to record the vision of woe which has been granted him. He foresees the utter desolation into which not only the land of Judah, <span class="cmt_word">but the earth</span> in general, will be brought, and which reminds him of nothing so much as the "waste and wild" condition of the earth previous to the first creative word. But why is "the earth" mentioned in this connection? Because the judgment upon Judah is but one act in the great general judgment which, when completed, will issue in a fresh order of things (comp. <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>, where side by side are mentioned Jehovah's judgment of "the peoples" and of "his people," and <a href="/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>, where the judgment upon the enemies of Israel is interwoven with the judgment upon "the earth"). <span class="cmt_word">Without form, and void</span>; rather, waste <span class="accented">and</span> wild (to represent in some degree the characteristic assonance of the original - tohu <span class="accented">va-bohu</span>); more literally, <span class="accented">immovable and lifeless</span>.
