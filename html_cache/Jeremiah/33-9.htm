The promise of renown, joy, praise, and glory signifies a future restoration and exaltation. This reflects God's covenant faithfulness and His ultimate plan for redemption. The city, once a place of judgment, will become a beacon of God's grace and power. This transformation is a testament to God's ability to renew and restore, pointing to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, where the New Jerusalem descends from heaven.<p><b>before all the nations of the earth</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the universal scope of God's plan. Jerusalem's restoration is not just for Israel but serves as a witness to all nations. This aligns with the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises that all peoples on earth will be blessed through Abraham's descendants. The global recognition of God's work in Jerusalem foreshadows the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where the disciples are sent to all nations.<p><b>who will hear of all the good I do for it</b><br>The goodness God promises to Jerusalem will be so profound that it will be heard worldwide. This echoes the prophetic vision of <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>, where nations stream to the mountain of the Lord, seeking His ways. The "good" includes peace, prosperity, and spiritual renewal, reflecting God's character and His desire for His people to be a light to the nations.<p><b>They will tremble in awe because of all the goodness and prosperity</b><br>The reaction of trembling in awe indicates a profound recognition of God's power and benevolence. This response is reminiscent of the fear of the Lord, a recurring biblical theme that denotes reverence and respect for God's majesty. The prosperity mentioned is not merely material but encompasses spiritual well-being and divine favor, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>, where obedience to God results in blessings.<p><b>that I will provide for it</b><br>God is the source of all the goodness and prosperity. This provision underscores His sovereignty and grace. The future tense "will provide" points to a prophetic fulfillment, assuring that God's promises are certain. This assurance is echoed in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, where Paul speaks of God supplying all needs according to His riches in glory. The ultimate provision is found in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's promise of salvation and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction and eventual restoration of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city referred to in this verse, which is central to God's covenant with Israel and a symbol of His presence and blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_of_the_earth.htm">Nations of the Earth</a></b><br>Represents the surrounding nations that will witness God's blessings upon Jerusalem and be in awe of His power and goodness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_goodness_and_prosperity.htm">God's Goodness and Prosperity</a></b><br>The divine acts of restoration and blessing that God promises to bestow upon Jerusalem, serving as a testament to His faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The event of God restoring Jerusalem, which is a recurring theme in Jeremiah, symbolizing hope and renewal for God's people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's promises are sure, and His plans for restoration and blessing are certain.
