Historically, Babylon was a dominant empire, and its fall was prophesied as a significant event. The "farthest border" suggests that the invaders would come from distant lands, possibly referring to the Medes and Persians who eventually conquered Babylon. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>, where God stirs up the Medes against Babylon. The comprehensive nature of the attack symbolizes God's complete judgment against the city for its idolatry and oppression.<p><b>Break open her granaries;</b><br>Granaries were essential for storing food and sustaining a population, especially in a city as large as Babylon. Breaking them open signifies not only the physical destruction but also the economic and social collapse of the city. In biblical times, granaries represented wealth and security, and their destruction would lead to famine and chaos. This act is a metaphor for stripping Babylon of its resources and power, as seen in other prophetic literature like <a href="/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17</a>, where the destruction of storehouses is a sign of divine judgment.<p><b>Pile her up like mounds of grain.</b><br>This imagery of piling up like mounds of grain suggests complete devastation and ruin. In an agricultural society, mounds of grain would typically signify abundance and prosperity. However, in this context, it is a picture of Babylon's destruction being as thorough and visible as heaps of harvested grain. The reversal of fortune is a common theme in prophetic writings, where the proud and mighty are brought low, as seen in the fall of other cities like Tyre in <a href="/ezekiel/26-4.htm">Ezekiel 26:4-5</a>.<p><b>Devote her to destruction;</b><br>The phrase "devote her to destruction" uses the Hebrew concept of "herem," which means to utterly destroy something as an offering to God. This was often used in the context of holy war, where cities and peoples were completely destroyed as an act of divine judgment, as seen in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). This indicates that Babylon's destruction is not just a military conquest but a divinely ordained act of judgment for its sins, including idolatry and oppression of God's people.<p><b>Leave her no survivors.</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of Babylon's judgment, leaving no remnant of its former power or population. It reflects the severity of God's judgment against those who oppose Him and His people. Historically, while Babylon was conquered, the city itself was not immediately destroyed, but over time it fell into ruin, fulfilling the prophecy. This complete desolation is echoed in <a href="/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>, where Babylon's fall is depicted as final and irreversible, symbolizing the ultimate defeat of evil in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The primary subject of this prophecy, Babylon was a powerful empire known for its wealth and military might.

Just as the LORD stirred the Medes and Persians from distant lands (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27-28</a>), He directs them to converge on the proud city. The phrase assures Judah that God&#8217;s judgment will be thorough, beginning where Babylon presumed herself safest&#8212;her outermost borders.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Break open her granaries</b><p>Babylon&#8217;s storehouses, symbols of wealth and self-reliance, will be forced open. This echoes the earlier warning that the LORD would &#8220;dry up her sea&#8221; and &#8220;make her springs run dry&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/51-36.htm">Jeremiah 51:36</a>). When God judges, He targets the very resources a nation trusts instead of Him, much like He stripped Egypt&#8217;s idols (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>) and shattered Tyre&#8217;s riches (<a href="/ezekiel/26-12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>). The granaries&#8217; plundering underlines that no earthly security can withstand divine wrath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pile her up like mounds of grain</b><p>The imagery flips prosperity into humiliation. Grain normally gathered for blessing now becomes heaps of ruin, resembling the piles left after a harvest field is stripped bare (<a href="/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17</a>). Babylon will be so thoroughly overthrown that her debris resembles harvest remnants&#8212;visible evidence that God has &#8220;harvested&#8221; her arrogance (<a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>). For Israel, the vision offers hope: the oppressor who treated nations like chaff (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-10</a>) will herself become a useless heap.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Devote her to destruction</b><p>The command recalls Israel&#8217;s ancient herem principle, where certain cities were set apart for total destruction to honor God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). In the same way, Babylon is marked out as an offering of judgment. This is not random violence; it is righteous retribution for her crimes&#8212;especially her defilement of the temple and cruelty toward God&#8217;s people (<a href="/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8-9</a>). By applying herem language, the LORD emphasizes the moral and spiritual dimension of the sentence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Leave her no survivors</b><p>The final note underscores the completeness of the fall. While small remnants often escape divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/46-28.htm">Jeremiah 46:28</a>), Babylon, like Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-20</a>), receives none. The line previews <a href="/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21-23</a>, where future Babylon&#8217;s lamp is extinguished forever. God wants Judah to see that evil powers, no matter how entrenched, face certain extinction under His sovereign hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a> portrays a five-fold, God-directed assault on Babylon: invading from every border, seizing her resources, turning her glory into debris, consecrating her to total ruin, and erasing every survivor. Each phrase reassures God&#8217;s people that their oppressor will be decisively judged, proving the LORD&#8217;s absolute faithfulness to His promises of justice and deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/50.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Open her storehouses.</span>--The noun is not found elsewhere.
