In the context of Jeremiah, the people of Judah were repeatedly warned by God through the prophets to turn from their idolatrous practices and return to Him. The phrase "to your own harm" underscores the self-destructive nature of ignoring divine guidance. Historically, this disobedience led to the Babylonian exile, a significant event in Jewish history. The failure to listen to God is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience.<p><b>declares the LORD,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and sovereignty of God. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that asserts the divine origin of the message. It is not merely Jeremiah speaking, but God Himself. This divine declaration is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God is the ultimate authority. The phrase is used throughout the prophetic books to affirm that the message is not of human origin but is a direct communication from God.<p><b>so you have provoked Me to anger</b><br>The provocation of God's anger is a serious matter, reflecting the gravity of the people's sins. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, idolatry and injustice were seen as direct violations of the covenant with God. The anger of God is not capricious but is a response to persistent rebellion and sin. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a>, where the Israelites' rebellion in the wilderness provoked God's anger. Theologically, God's anger is always just and is aimed at bringing about repentance and restoration.<p><b>with the works of your hands.</b><br>This phrase refers to the idolatrous practices and the creation of physical idols, which were prevalent in Judah at the time. The "works of your hands" is a common biblical expression denoting human efforts that are contrary to God's will, often associated with idol-making (<a href="/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>). In a broader sense, it can also refer to any human endeavor that is done in defiance of God. Theologically, this highlights the futility of trusting in man-made objects or efforts rather than in God. The phrase serves as a warning against the pride and self-reliance that lead people away from trusting in the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
