Gleaning allowed the poor and the foreigner to collect leftover crops after the harvesters had passed through. The imagery here suggests a level of mercy and provision even in judgment, contrasting with the total devastation prophesied for Edom. The reference to grape gatherers implies a natural and expected process, where some remnants are left behind, highlighting the thoroughness of God's impending judgment compared to human actions.<p><b>Were thieves to come in the night, would they not steal only what they wanted?</b><br>This phrase uses the analogy of thieves, who typically take only what they can carry or what is most valuable, leaving behind much of what they encounter. The comparison underscores the completeness of the destruction that will befall Edom, as it will be more severe than a typical robbery. Thieves act with self-interest and limitation, but God's judgment is portrayed as all-encompassing and without restraint. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>, reinforcing the theme of total desolation.
