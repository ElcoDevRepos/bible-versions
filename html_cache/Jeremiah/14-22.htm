In ancient Near Eastern cultures, rain was crucial for agriculture and survival, and many nations worshipped deities they believed controlled the weather. The rhetorical question underscores the impotence of these idols, contrasting them with the power of the true God. This theme is echoed in passages like <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>, where Elijah confronts the prophets of Baal, demonstrating that only the LORD can control the elements.<p><b>Do the skies alone send showers?</b><br>This question emphasizes the belief that natural occurrences are not random or autonomous but are under divine control. In the ancient world, people often attributed weather patterns to the whims of various gods. The biblical perspective, however, asserts that the skies are not independent agents but are subject to the will of the Creator. This aligns with passages like <a href="/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25-28</a>, where God questions Job about the origins of rain, highlighting His sovereignty over creation.<p><b>Is this not by You, O LORD our God?</b><br>Here, the text acknowledges the LORD as the ultimate source of rain and blessings. This recognition of God's sovereignty is a central theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-17</a>, where obedience to God is linked to the provision of rain. The phrase also reflects a covenant relationship, where God is not just a distant deity but "our God," indicating a personal and communal bond with the people of Israel.<p><b>So we put our hope in You,</b><br>This expression of trust is a declaration of faith and reliance on God rather than on human or idolatrous means. In times of drought or hardship, the people are encouraged to place their hope in the LORD, who has proven faithful. This sentiment is echoed in Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20-22</a>, where hope in God is associated with His unfailing love and deliverance.<p><b>for You have done all these things.</b><br>The concluding phrase acknowledges God's past actions as the basis for present trust. It reflects a historical awareness of God's deeds, such as the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and the miraculous crossing of the Jordan River (Joshua 3). This acknowledgment serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and power, encouraging continued reliance on Him. The phrase also points to the comprehensive nature of God's sovereignty, as He is responsible for all aspects of creation and history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is sovereign over creation and the only true source of life and sustenance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols_of_the_nations.htm">Idols of the Nations</a></b><br>Representations of false gods worshiped by surrounding nations, which were powerless and unable to provide for the needs of the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing drought and famine as a consequence of their unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rain_and_showers.htm">Rain and Showers</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's provision and blessing, essential for life and prosperity in an agrarian society.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God alone has control over the natural world, including the weather.

Ancient peoples carved images, named them &#8220;Baal&#8221; or &#8220;Asherah,&#8221; and begged them for weather favor, but nothing happened. <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a> says idols &#8220;have mouths, but cannot speak&#8230; those who make them become like them.&#8221; <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a> ridicules the same empty practice. Elijah&#8217;s showdown on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-25.htm">1 Kings 18:25-29</a>) is a vivid real-life proof: four hundred fifty prophets called on Baal from morning till evening, yet the sky stayed silent. Scripture, taken at face value, insists that statues cannot so much as move, let alone adjust the jet stream.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Idolatry promises provision but delivers drought.<p>&#8226; False worship always leads to disappointment and judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; 10:14-15).<p>&#8226; Modern &#8220;idols&#8221; of technology, wealth, or self-reliance fare no better; none can command the clouds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do the skies alone send showers?</b><p>Jeremiah&#8217;s next question challenges a purely naturalistic outlook. Yes, meteorological patterns exist, yet <a href="/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25-28</a> reminds us that God &#8220;channels a torrent of rain&#8221; and &#8220;begets drops of dew.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/147-8.htm">Psalm 147:8</a> celebrates the Lord who &#8220;covers the sky with clouds; He prepares rain for the earth.&#8221; Even Jesus said the Father &#8220;sends rain on the righteous and the wicked&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). Scripture consistently attributes weather to divine governance, never to impersonal chance.<p>Helpful contrasts:<p>&#8226; Secondary causes: evaporation, wind currents, frontal systems.<p>&#8226; Primary Cause: the Lord who designed, sustains, and directs those systems (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is this not by You, O LORD our God?</b><p>Here Jeremiah answers his own questions: rain is God&#8217;s deliberate act. Covenant passages such as <a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-17</a> explicitly tie rainfall to Israel&#8217;s obedience. When Solomon dedicated the temple, God warned, &#8220;If I shut up the heavens so there is no rain&#8230; and My people humble themselves&#8230; I will forgive and heal their land&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13-14</a>). Paul later told pagans in Lystra that the living God &#8220;has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>). These verses, accepted literally, show that heaven&#8217;s faucet has a divine hand on it.<p>Implications:<p>&#8226; Weather is personal, not random.<p>&#8226; Repentance and prayer genuinely matter (<a href="/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>; <a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognizing God&#8217;s sovereignty deepens gratitude in abundance and patience in drought.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So we put our hope in You, for You have done all these things.</b><p>The prophet moves from doctrine to devotion. Knowing who controls the rain leads naturally to trust. <a href="/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5-8</a> urges, &#8220;Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; my hope comes from Him.&#8221; <a href="/lamentations/3-24.htm">Lamentations 3:24</a> echoes, &#8220;The LORD is my portion&#8230; therefore I will hope in Him.&#8221; <a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a> pronounces a blessing on those who overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
