The context is the period of the Babylonian Empire's expansion, around the early 6th century BC. Nebuchadnezzar is referred to as "My servant," which highlights that God uses even pagan kings to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> with Cyrus. This reflects the biblical theme that God raises and deposes kings (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). The "lands" refer to the nations surrounding Judah, including Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27</a>. This was a time of political upheaval, and God was using Babylon as an instrument of judgment against these nations, including Judah, for their disobedience and idolatry.<p><b>I have even made the beasts of the field subject to him.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the extent of Nebuchadnezzar's dominion, suggesting a comprehensive rule that includes not just people but all creation within the lands. This echoes the dominion mandate given to humanity in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, showing a temporary fulfillment through Nebuchadnezzar. It also foreshadows the ultimate reign of Christ, who will have dominion over all creation (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>). The mention of "beasts of the field" can symbolize the totality of control and the peace that comes with a ruler's authority, as seen in prophetic visions like <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, where harmony in creation is restored. This also serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority over all creation, as He can delegate power to whomever He chooses, even to a foreign king like Nebuchadnezzar.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah and the surrounding nations.

The Babylonian rise is the direct result of divine appointment, underscoring that history unfolds on God&#8217;s timetable (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;All these lands&#8221; refers to Judah and her neighbors listed in <a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>, a reminder that God&#8217;s sovereignty is comprehensive, covering both covenant people and Gentile nations.<p>&#8226; For the original hearers, this meant submission was obedience; resistance was rebellion against God Himself (<a href="/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>under the authority of My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><p>&#8226; God calls a pagan ruler &#8220;My servant,&#8221; the same title given to David (<a href="/2_samuel/3-18.htm">2 Samuel 3:18</a>) and Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>). This highlights that service is determined by God&#8217;s purpose, not human righteousness (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;king of Babylon&#8221; identifies the geopolitical instrument of judgment. Babylon&#8217;s power is delegated, not inherent (<a href="/daniel/5-18.htm">Daniel 5:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Authority here is literal political dominance&#8212;tribute, forced labor, and control of foreign policy (<a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel was to accept Babylonian yokes (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a>). Refusal would invite harsher discipline, illustrating that surrender to God&#8217;s plan is safer than clinging to one&#8217;s own (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have even made the beasts of the field subject to him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Even&#8221; widens the scope from human kingdoms to creation itself, echoing <a href="/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a> and <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6-8</a>.<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/2-38.htm">Daniel 2:38</a> confirms this promise: &#8220;Wherever the sons of men dwell&#8230; He has given them into your hand and has made you ruler over them all&#8212;you are that head of gold.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This dominion motif reminds Israel of Adam&#8217;s mandate; God can transfer stewardship to whom He chooses.<p>&#8226; Practically, it portrays absolute control&#8212;economic (livestock), military (war-horses, supplies), and environmental (hunting grounds). No corner of life lay outside the judgment God was handing over.<p>&#8226; By extending authority to animals, God leaves no doubt: Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s reign is temporary but total, lasting exactly as long as God decrees (<a href="/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a> reveals God&#8217;s unrivaled sovereignty. He appoints territories, delegates authority to a pagan king, and even places the animal kingdom under Babylon&#8217;s sway. For Judah, submission to Nebuchadnezzar meant submission to God&#8217;s chastening hand; resistance meant further judgment. The verse is a sober reminder that every ruler, realm, and creature remains under heaven&#8217;s rule, and that trusting God&#8217;s purposes&#8212;however uncomfortable&#8212;is the path of wisdom and life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Nebuchadnezzar . . .</span> <span class= "bld">my servant.</span>--See Note on <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm" title="Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, said the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.">Jeremiah 25:9</a> for the title thus given. The special stress laid on "the beasts of the field" is, perhaps, connected with the resistance of the nations to the levies made by the Babylonian officers upon their horses and cattle, or their claim to use the land they had subdued, after the manner which we see depicted on Assyrian sculptures, as a hunting-ground.
