In the context of Jeremiah, it refers to the spiritual and moral decay of Judah. The Hebrew words used here convey a sense of astonishment and dread, suggesting that the actions of the people are not only sinful but also deeply offensive to God. This echoes the language used in other prophetic books, such as Isaiah and Ezekiel, where similar terms describe the people's rebellion against God. The "horrible and shocking thing" can be seen as a precursor to the judgment that God will bring upon the nation, highlighting the severity of their transgressions.<p><b>has happened</b><br>The use of the past tense indicates that the event has already occurred, emphasizing the immediacy and reality of the situation. This is not a future warning but a present reality that the people of Judah must confront. The certainty of the event underscores the prophetic role of Jeremiah, who is tasked with bringing God's message to a people who have already strayed far from His commandments. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience, as seen throughout the history of Israel, where turning away from God leads to calamity.<p><b>in the land</b><br>The "land" refers specifically to the land of Judah, the southern kingdom of Israel. This geographical reference is significant because the land was a central element of God's covenant with Israel. It was a gift from God, a place where His people were to live in obedience and worship. The defilement of the land through idolatry and injustice is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, and it often leads to divine judgment. The mention of the land also connects to the broader biblical narrative of the Promised Land, a type of the eternal inheritance promised to believers through Christ. The corruption of the land serves as a stark contrast to the holiness that God desires for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
