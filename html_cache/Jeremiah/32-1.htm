The phrase "word of the LORD" is a common biblical expression indicating a direct revelation from God, which is a hallmark of prophetic literature. Jeremiah, as a prophet, often received messages from God to deliver to the people of Judah, calling them to repentance and warning them of impending judgment. This divine communication highlights the authority and authenticity of Jeremiah's prophecies.<p><b>in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah</b><br>Zedekiah was the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile. His reign is marked by political instability and rebellion against Babylonian rule. The tenth year of Zedekiah's reign corresponds to 588-587 BC, a critical period in Judah's history as it was during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem. This timeframe situates the prophecy in a context of imminent destruction and crisis for Judah, as the city was under threat from Nebuchadnezzar's forces. Zedekiah's reign was characterized by his failure to heed prophetic warnings, including those from Jeremiah, which ultimately led to the fall of Jerusalem.<p><b>which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was the king of Babylon and a dominant figure in the ancient Near East. His eighteenth year, around 587 BC, marks the height of his power and the culmination of his campaign against Judah. This period is significant as it leads to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecies of judgment. Nebuchadnezzar's role as an instrument of God's judgment is a recurring theme in Jeremiah, illustrating the sovereignty of God over nations and rulers. The historical context of Nebuchadnezzar's reign provides insight into the geopolitical dynamics of the time, as Babylon was expanding its empire and asserting dominance over the region.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Jewish people.
