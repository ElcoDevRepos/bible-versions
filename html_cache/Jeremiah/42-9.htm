His prophetic ministry spanned the reigns of several kings, and he often faced opposition and persecution. In this context, Jeremiah is acting as an intermediary between the people and God, highlighting his role as a faithful servant despite the challenges he faced.<p><b>&#8220;Thus says the LORD,</b><br>This phrase is a common introduction to prophetic messages, indicating that the words following are not Jeremiah's own but are directly from God. It underscores the authority and divine origin of the message. The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the translation of the Tetragrammaton, YHWH, the personal name of God revealed to Moses, emphasizing His covenant relationship with Israel.<p><b>the God of Israel,</b><br>This title reaffirms God's special relationship with Israel, His chosen people. It serves as a reminder of the covenant established with the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;and the promises made to them. Despite Israel's repeated disobedience, God remains their God, faithful to His covenant.<p><b>to whom you sent me</b><br>The people had approached Jeremiah to seek God's guidance, indicating a recognition of his prophetic authority and their need for divine direction. This act of sending Jeremiah to God reflects a moment of humility and dependence on divine wisdom, though it is often accompanied by a lack of genuine commitment to follow through on God's instructions.<p><b>to present your petition:</b><br>The petition likely involved seeking guidance or deliverance from the dire circumstances facing the remnant in Judah after the Babylonian conquest. This reflects a common biblical theme where people turn to God in times of crisis. However, the sincerity of their request is questionable, as subsequent events reveal their reluctance to obey God's counsel. This phrase also highlights the role of prayer and intercession in the believer's life, where petitions are brought before God through His appointed servants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

He does not add personal opinion&#8212;he &#8220;told them&#8221; exactly what God revealed (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7-9</a>; 37:17).<p>&#8226; The remnant had begged him for ten days to seek God&#8217;s direction (<a href="/jeremiah/42-2.htm">Jeremiah 42:2-7</a>). Their willingness to wait shows initial humility, yet Jeremiah&#8217;s repetition of their words will later expose their double-mindedness (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; By speaking out loud to the gathered people, Jeremiah ensures communal accountability, echoing earlier prophetic settings where the word is proclaimed publicly (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11-13</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-1.htm">Jonah 3:1-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Thus says the LORD</b><p>&#8226; This classic prophetic formula announces that the message carries divine&#8212;not human&#8212;authority (<a href="/jeremiah/30-1.htm">Jeremiah 30:1-2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds the listeners that obedience is owed directly to God (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>). Ignoring the word would mean rejecting the LORD Himself (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores Scripture&#8217;s inspiration: &#8220;men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the God of Israel</b><p>&#8226; God identifies Himself in covenant terms. He is not a distant deity but the One bound to His people by promise (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-1.htm">Jeremiah 31:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The title stresses both ownership and responsibility: Israel belongs to Him, and He will act consistently with His unchanging character (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Even after judgment and exile, He still calls Himself &#8220;the God of Israel,&#8221; revealing steadfast love (<a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to whom you sent me</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah reminds them that seeking this word was their idea (<a href="/jeremiah/42-2.htm">Jeremiah 42:2-3</a>). They cannot claim ignorance later.<p>&#8226; This line highlights proper mediation: God appoints prophets, and the people recognize that appointment (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It also raises the accountability bar. When we actively request divine guidance, we obligate ourselves to obey it (<a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4-10</a>; <a href="/john/13-17.htm">John 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to present your petition</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Petition&#8221; frames their request as prayer&#8212;a plea for direction and safety (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording implies they wanted more than information; they sought God&#8217;s favor. Yet favor is tied to obedience (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s forthcoming message will show that God hears and answers, but the blessing hinges on staying in the land rather than fleeing to Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10-12</a> vs. 42:13-17).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9</a> is the formal preamble to God&#8217;s answer for a frightened remnant. Each phrase stacks layers of accountability: the prophet&#8217;s faithfulness, God&#8217;s absolute authority, His covenant identity, the people&#8217;s deliberate request, and the prayerful nature of that request. Together they underscore that when God speaks, especially in response to an earnest petition, His people must trust and obey&#8212;anything less courts the very judgment they hope to escape.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Jeremiah] told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
