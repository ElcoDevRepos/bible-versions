This historical context is significant as it was a time of both political turmoil and spiritual renewal. Micah's prophecies, which include warnings of judgment and promises of restoration, align with the themes of repentance and divine justice that were prevalent during Hezekiah's reign.<p><b>and told all the people of Judah that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:</b><br>The phrase "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies. It underscores the authority behind Micah's message, indicating that it is not merely human opinion but a divine decree. This introduction to the prophecy serves to remind the people of Judah of God's ultimate control and the seriousness of the message being delivered.<p><b>&#8216;Zion will be plowed like a field,</b><br>Zion, often synonymous with Jerusalem, represents the spiritual and political heart of Judah. The imagery of being "plowed like a field" suggests total devastation and destruction, a reversal of its status as a thriving city. This prophecy serves as a warning of the consequences of the nation's sins and a call to repentance. It also foreshadows the eventual Babylonian exile, where Jerusalem would indeed face destruction.<p><b>Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,</b><br>This phrase continues the theme of destruction, painting a vivid picture of Jerusalem's fate if the people do not turn back to God. Historically, Jerusalem faced multiple sieges and destructions, notably by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The prophecy serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the reality of divine judgment.<p><b>and the temple mount a wooded ridge.&#8217;</b><br>The temple mount, the site of Solomon's Temple, was the center of Jewish worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. The prophecy that it would become "a wooded ridge" indicates complete desolation, where the sacred site would be overtaken by nature, symbolizing the loss of divine favor and the abandonment of the covenant relationship. This imagery also points to the eventual need for a new covenant, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who spoke of His body as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah_of_moresheth.htm">Micah of Moresheth</a></b><br>A prophet from the town of Moresheth, who prophesied during the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah.

The epithet indicated his birth in Moresheth-gath in Philistia (<a href="/micah/1-14.htm" title="Therefore shall you give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.">Micah 1:14</a>). As Micah had prophesied under Jotham and Ahaz (<a href="/micah/1-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.">Micah 1:1</a>), the prediction here referred to must have been delivered towards the close of his ministry. The words cited are from <a href="/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>, and immediately precede the prediction of an ultimate restoration of Judah in the last days in <a href="/context/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-2</a>, which we find in identical terms in <a href="/context/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>. Here, then, was a case, is the implied argument of the elders, in which a threat did its work, and therefore was not fulfilled. It did good, and not evil. The phrase "mountain of the house" is not found elsewhere in Jeremiah as a description of the Temple. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Micah the Morasthite</span>, etc. The "elders" appeal for a precedent to the case of Micah (called after his native place, Moresheth-Gath, to distinguish him from other Micahs), who had been equally explicit in his declarations of woe to Jerusalem, without incurring the charge <span class="accented">of</span> blasphemy.
