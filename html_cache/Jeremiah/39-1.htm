His reign began in 597 BC, and he was placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar after the deportation of Jehoiachin. The ninth year of his reign would be around 588 BC. Zedekiah's reign was marked by political instability and rebellion against Babylonian rule, despite the warnings of the prophet Jeremiah. This period is significant as it marks the final years of the kingdom of Judah before its destruction.<p><b>in the tenth month</b><br>The tenth month in the Hebrew calendar is Tevet, which corresponds to December-January in the Gregorian calendar. This specific timing is crucial as it marks the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem, a pivotal event in Jewish history. The siege would last for approximately 18 months, leading to the eventual fall of the city and the destruction of the First Temple.<p><b>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was one of the most powerful monarchs of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, reigning from 605 to 562 BC. He is known for his military conquests and the expansion of the Babylonian Empire. His campaigns against Judah were part of a larger strategy to control the Levant and secure trade routes. Nebuchadnezzar's role in the destruction of Jerusalem fulfills the prophecies given by Jeremiah and other prophets regarding Judah's punishment for their disobedience to God.<p><b>marched against Jerusalem with his entire army</b><br>The march against Jerusalem was a calculated military campaign. The Babylonian army was known for its strength and strategic prowess. This phrase indicates the seriousness of the siege, as Nebuchadnezzar committed his full military resources to subdue Jerusalem. The siege tactics would have included surrounding the city, cutting off supplies, and using siege engines to breach the walls.<p><b>and laid siege to the city</b><br>The siege of Jerusalem was a devastating event for the inhabitants. It resulted in severe famine, as described in Lamentations, and ultimately led to the city's fall in 586 BC. The siege is a fulfillment of the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who urged the people to repent and submit to Babylonian rule to avoid destruction. The fall of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile are seen as a judgment from God for the nation's idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. This event also sets the stage for the eventual return and restoration of the Jewish people, as prophesied in later scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of the Babylonian siege.
