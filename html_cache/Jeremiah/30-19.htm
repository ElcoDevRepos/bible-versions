Historically, the Israelites often turned to thanksgiving after deliverance from oppression or hardship, as seen in the Psalms. This prophecy suggests a reversal of their current state of exile and suffering. The thanksgiving is not just individual but communal, reflecting a collective return to God and acknowledgment of His mercy and faithfulness.<p><b>A sound of celebration</b><br>The sound of celebration implies joy and festivity, often associated with religious feasts and gatherings in ancient Israel. This echoes the joy described in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>, where the redeemed return with singing. The cultural context of Israel included numerous festivals, such as Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles, which were times of great rejoicing and remembrance of God's provision and deliverance.<p><b>I will multiply them, and they will not be decreased</b><br>This promise of multiplication recalls the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, where God promises to make Abraham's descendants numerous. It signifies not only numerical growth but also spiritual and material prosperity. Historically, the population of Israel had been decimated by exile and conquest, so this promise would have been a profound assurance of restoration and future security.<p><b>I will honor them, and they will not be belittled</b><br>To be honored by God is to be elevated in status and dignity, contrasting with the shame and humiliation experienced during exile. This phrase suggests a reversal of fortunes, where Israel, once despised among the nations, will be esteemed. It aligns with prophecies in <a href="/isaiah/60-15.htm">Isaiah 60:15</a>, where God promises to make Israel an eternal pride and joy. This honor can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, though initially rejected, is ultimately exalted and honored by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of both judgment and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which faced destruction and exile due to its disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the people of Judah were taken captive by Babylon, a significant event in Jewish history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The promise of God to bring His people back from exile and restore them to their land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who promises restoration and blessing to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_thanksgiving.htm">The Power of Thanksgiving</a></b><br>Thanksgiving is not just a response to God's blessings but a powerful act of faith that aligns us with His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_promise_of_multiplication.htm">God's Promise of Multiplication</a></b><br>God's intention is to bless and increase His people, both spiritually and materially, as they walk in obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_honor.htm">Restoration and Honor</a></b><br>Even in times of exile or hardship, God promises restoration and honor, reminding us of His faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/celebration_as_worship.htm">Celebration as Worship</a></b><br>The sound of celebration is an expression of worship and gratitude, acknowledging God's goodness and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_faithfulness.htm">Hope in God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>In times of despair, we can hold onto the hope that God will fulfill His promises of restoration and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_30_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 30:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Cultivate_daily_gratitude_as_in_Jer_30_19.htm">How can we cultivate "thanksgiving" in our daily lives as Jeremiah 30:19 suggests?

God&#8217;s restoration of Israel after exile will not be quiet or hidden. It will break out in verbal, public gratitude, much like the chorus in <a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a> where voices cry, &#8220;Give thanks to the LORD of Hosts, for the LORD is good.&#8221; <a href="/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a> adds that &#8220;joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the sound of melody.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The thanksgiving is spontaneous&#8212;&#8220;will proceed,&#8221; not be forced.<p>&#8226; It is collective&#8212;coming &#8220;from them,&#8221; the whole community.<p>&#8226; It is God-focused&#8212;thanksgiving arises because the LORD alone reversed their fortunes (<a href="/psalms/107-1.htm">Psalm 107:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>Application: when God delivers, His people cannot help but speak up.
