It signifies that the message is not from the prophet's own thoughts but is divinely inspired.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* Jeremiah was a prophet during a tumultuous period in Judah's history, spanning the reigns of several kings and leading up to the Babylonian exile. This phrase indicates the beginning of a divine revelation to Jeremiah, who was called to deliver God's message to a rebellious nation.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* Similar phrases are found throughout the prophetic books, such as in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea, emphasizing the consistency of God's communication with His prophets. This underscores the authority and authenticity of the prophetic message.<br><br>*Prophecy:* The phrase sets the stage for the prophetic declarations that follow, which often include calls to repentance, warnings of judgment, and promises of restoration. It highlights the role of the prophet as a mouthpiece for God.<br><br>*Types of Jesus Christ:* While this specific phrase does not directly typify Christ, the concept of the "word of the LORD" can be connected to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), who brings God's ultimate revelation to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
