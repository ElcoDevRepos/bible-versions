In the context of Jeremiah, it reflects the impending judgment on Jerusalem. The call to "rise up" is often used in military contexts throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9</a>, where God instructs Gideon to rise and attack the Midianite camp. It signifies readiness and divine timing in executing God's judgment.<p><b>let us attack by night</b><br>Attacking by night suggests a strategy of surprise and stealth, which was a common military tactic in ancient times. Night attacks are mentioned in other biblical narratives, such as in <a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19</a>, where Gideon attacks the Midianites at night. This tactic underscores the severity and inevitability of the judgment against Jerusalem, as the attackers are determined to succeed by any means necessary.<p><b>and destroy her fortresses!</b><br>The fortresses refer to the strongholds and defenses of Jerusalem. Historically, Jerusalem was a well-fortified city with significant walls and defenses, as seen in archaeological findings. The destruction of these fortresses symbolizes the complete overthrow of the city's security and the divine judgment that cannot be resisted. This imagery is echoed in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/isaiah/25-12.htm">Isaiah 25:12</a>, where God promises to bring down the fortified walls of the proud. The destruction of fortresses can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over spiritual strongholds, as referenced in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where the weapons of our warfare are described as having divine power to demolish strongholds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

It was the focal point of Jeremiah's prophecies concerning judgment and restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fortresses.htm">Fortresses</a></b><br>Symbolic of the defenses and strongholds of Jerusalem, both physical and spiritual, which were ultimately insufficient against the judgment decreed by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_repentance.htm">The Urgency of Repentance</a></b><br>The call to "arise" and "attack by night" underscores the urgency of the situation.

This serves as a warning to not rely on worldly securities but to seek refuge in God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_vigilance.htm">Spiritual Vigilance</a></b><br>The night attack symbolizes the unexpected nature of God's judgment.
