In the context of ancient Israel, an "outrage" refers to a grievous sin that violates the covenant relationship with God. The term underscores the moral and spiritual corruption present among the people. The prophets were expected to uphold God's law, and their failure to do so was a significant breach of trust.<p><b>by committing adultery with the wives of their neighbors</b><br>Adultery is a direct violation of the seventh commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>) and was considered a serious offense in Israelite society. It symbolizes unfaithfulness not only in marriage but also in the people's relationship with God. The prophets' actions were a metaphor for Israel's spiritual adultery, as seen in other prophetic books like Hosea, where Israel's idolatry is likened to marital unfaithfulness.<p><b>and speaking lies in My name</b><br>The false prophets claimed to speak for God, yet they delivered messages that were not from Him. This is a direct violation of the commandment against taking the Lord's name in vain (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). It also reflects the broader theme of false prophecy found throughout the Old Testament, where true prophets like Jeremiah often stood in opposition to those who falsely claimed divine authority (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-18</a>).<p><b>which I did not command them to do</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and the importance of true prophecy. The false prophets acted on their own authority, not God's. This distinction is crucial, as true prophets are called and sent by God, as seen in the calling of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-10</a>). The false prophets' actions were a direct challenge to God's authority and order.<p><b>I am He who knows, and I am a witness</b><br>God's omniscience and omnipresence are highlighted here. He is aware of all actions and intentions, and nothing is hidden from Him. This assurance is a comfort to the faithful and a warning to the unfaithful. The idea of God as a witness is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where God's intimate knowledge of human actions is described.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>This phrase reaffirms the authority and finality of God's pronouncement. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that underscores the divine origin of the message. It serves as a reminder that the words spoken are not merely human opinions but are the authoritative word of God, as seen throughout the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah_the_nehelamite.htm">Shemaiah the Nehelamite</a></b><br>A false prophet who opposed Jeremiah and sent letters to Jerusalem, attempting to discredit Jeremiah's prophecies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab_son_of_kolaiah_and_zedekiah_son_of_maaseiah.htm">Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah</a></b><br>False prophets mentioned in the context of <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a>, who were accused of committing adultery and speaking lies in God's name.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites were exiled, and where Jeremiah's letter was sent to the exiles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is the ultimate judge and witness to the actions of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Adultery and lying, especially in God's name, are grave sins that have serious consequences.

The verse teaches that God&#8217;s servants must match holy living with truthful speech, because the Lord knows, sees, and will hold every person accountable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Because they have committed villany . . .</span>--The Hebrew noun is almost always used for sins of impurity. It is more commonly rendered "folly" (comp. <a href="/genesis/34-7.htm" title="And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.">Genesis 34:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-21.htm" title="Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she has worked folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shall you put evil away from among you.">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>; <a href="/context/judges/19-23.htm" title="And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, no, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.">Judges 19:23-24</a>). The English word "villainy" is used definitely with this meaning by Bishop Hall (<span class= "ital">Sat. i.</span> 9).<p><span class= "bld">Even I know, and am a witness, saith the Lord.</span>--The words find an echo in <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm" title="And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:5</a>. We are left to conjecture whether the prophet refers his own knowledge of the facts to a direct supernatural source, or had received private information from his friends at Babylon. The special stress laid on the Lord's knowledge of their guilt suggests the thought that the false prophets with their restricted ideas of God had persuaded themselves that Jehovah the God of Israel hardly exercised his attributes of power in a distant place like Babylon. There they might sin without fear of detection or of punishment. They thought of him as a God not nigh at hand, but far off (<a href="/jeremiah/23-23.htm" title="Am I a God at hand, said the LORD, and not a God afar off?">Jeremiah 23:23</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - An important and melancholy addition to our knowledge of these false prophets.
