This phrase indicates his acceptance of the situation, reminiscent of other prophets like Elijah and Isaiah who also faced opposition. It highlights the personal nature of his ministry and the loneliness often experienced by those called to deliver God's messages.<p><b>here I am in your hands</b><br>Jeremiah acknowledges the authority of the people and leaders over his physical fate, demonstrating his vulnerability. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of submission to God's will, as seen in the lives of Joseph and Daniel, who also found themselves at the mercy of others. It underscores the prophet's trust in God's ultimate sovereignty despite human actions.<p><b>do to me</b><br>This reflects Jeremiah's acceptance of potential suffering, similar to the attitude of Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane. It shows a willingness to endure hardship for the sake of truth, a common theme in the lives of biblical figures who were persecuted for their faithfulness to God.<p><b>what you think is good and right</b><br>Jeremiah appeals to the conscience and moral judgment of his audience, challenging them to consider their actions in light of divine justice. This phrase invites reflection on the nature of true justice, as defined by God, and is reminiscent of the biblical call to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). It also foreshadows the trial of Jesus, where Pilate faced a similar moral dilemma.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Like Joshua&#8217;s &#8220;But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>) and Micaiah&#8217;s &#8220;As surely as the LORD lives, I will speak whatever my God tells me&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-13.htm">2 Chronicles 18:13</a>), Jeremiah stands firm. He has done exactly what God commanded (<a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>), and his conscience is clear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>here I am</b><p>These words echo the willing availability of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and young Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>). Jeremiah is not fleeing or hiding; he is present, accessible, and transparent. His posture says, &#8220;I have nothing to conceal, for I have spoken truth.&#8221; That open stance invites accountability while trusting the Lord&#8217;s oversight (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in your hands</b><p>Jeremiah acknowledges that the officials and people humanly control his fate, similar to Joseph being &#8220;in our hands&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/37-27.htm">Genesis 37:27</a>) and Jesus telling the arresting crowd, &#8220;This is your hour, and the dominion of darkness&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-53.htm">Luke 22:53</a>). Yet the prophet knows ultimate authority is still God&#8217;s (<a href="/jeremiah/26-15.htm">Jeremiah 26:15</a>). He yields to earthly jurisdiction without abandoning spiritual confidence (<a href="/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do to me</b><p>He grants them freedom to act, echoing Paul&#8217;s &#8220;I consider my life of no value to myself&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>) and Esther&#8217;s &#8220;If I perish, I perish&#8221; (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). Jeremiah&#8217;s priority is obedience, not self-preservation. This statement underscores that proclaiming God&#8217;s message sometimes costs comfort&#8212;or life itself (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what you think</b><p>The prophet recognizes their deliberation process: &#8220;do what you think.&#8221; People often weigh God&#8217;s word against personal preference (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>). Gamaliel later advised a similar council, &#8220;Consider carefully what you intend to do to these men&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-35.htm">Acts 5:35</a>). Jeremiah leaves room for them to reflect on the moral implications of their choice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is good and right</b><p>True goodness and righteousness are defined by God: &#8220;Be careful to obey&#8230;doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-28.htm">Deuteronomy 12:28</a>). Hurting God&#8217;s messenger is neither. Jeremiah subtly reminds them that if they pursue genuine good, they must spare him and heed the warning of impending judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/26-14.htm">Jeremiah 26:14</a> reveals a fearless prophet who, after faithfully delivering God&#8217;s word, places his life in the hands of his hearers. He models personal resolve, humble availability, submission to human authority under God&#8217;s sovereignty, willingness to suffer, respect for others&#8217; decision-making, and confidence that real goodness aligns with the Lord&#8217;s standards. The verse challenges believers to speak truth boldly and entrust outcomes to God, knowing that obedience is always &#8220;good and right.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">As for me, behold . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And I</span>, <span class= "ital">behold, I am in your hands; </span>and for "as seemeth good and meet unto you," read <span class= "ital">in your eyes. </span>The prophet feels himself powerless in the presence of his accusers and judges, and can but appeal to the Judge of all.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/26-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">here</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
