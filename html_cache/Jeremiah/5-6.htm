Here, it signifies impending judgment and destruction. The lion's habitat, the forest, suggests a natural and inevitable threat. Historically, lions were present in the Near East, making this imagery vivid for the original audience. The lion's attack symbolizes the Babylonian invasion, a divine instrument of judgment against Judah's sinfulness. This imagery echoes the warnings in <a href="/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>, where God describes Himself as a lion to Ephraim and Judah.<p><b>a wolf from the desert will ravage them</b><br>Wolves are known for their cunning and relentless nature. The desert, a place of desolation, enhances the sense of danger and isolation. This phrase underscores the severity of the threat facing Judah. Wolves in the Bible often symbolize destruction and deceit (<a href="/ezekiel/22-27.htm">Ezekiel 22:27</a>). The desert wolf's attack represents the relentless and consuming nature of the Babylonian forces, who would leave the land desolate.<p><b>A leopard will lie in wait near their cities</b><br>Leopards are known for their stealth and speed, making them effective predators. The imagery of a leopard lying in wait suggests an unavoidable and sudden attack. This reflects the strategic sieges laid by Babylonian armies around Judah's cities. The leopard's presence near cities indicates the proximity of danger and the inevitability of judgment. This imagery is consistent with the suddenness of divine judgment seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>.<p><b>and everyone who ventures out will be torn to pieces</b><br>This phrase highlights the totality and inescapability of the coming judgment. It emphasizes the personal impact on each individual who defies the warning. The tearing to pieces signifies complete destruction, leaving no room for escape or survival. This reflects the comprehensive nature of God's judgment on sin, as seen in other prophetic warnings like <a href="/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>.<p><b>For their rebellious acts are many</b><br>The root cause of the impending judgment is the multitude of rebellious acts committed by the people. Rebellion against God is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where Israel and Judah repeatedly turn away from God's commandments. This phrase underscores the justice of God's actions, as the people's persistent disobedience warrants divine retribution. The rebellion is reminiscent of the Israelites' behavior in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>).<p><b>and their unfaithful deeds are numerous</b><br>Unfaithfulness here refers to the spiritual adultery of the people, as they have turned to idolatry and forsaken their covenant with God. This spiritual infidelity is a major theme in Jeremiah, where the prophet often compares Judah's idolatry to marital unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>). The numerous unfaithful deeds highlight the depth of their apostasy and justify the severity of the coming judgment. This mirrors the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of breaking the covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

That swift, overpowering pounce mirrors the coming Babylonian invasion (<a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; 50:17).<p>&#8226; A lion attacks head-on&#8212;no warning, no negotiations. Judah had ignored countless prophetic warnings, so judgment would now be equally abrupt.<p>&#8226; God had earlier protected His people from such foes (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>). The reversal underlines that the same Lord who saves can also discipline (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Samson&#8217;s encounter with a lion (<a href="/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5-6</a>), the event proves supernatural strength is involved&#8212;only here, that strength stands against the unrepentant nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a wolf from the desert will ravage them</b><p>The picture shifts to a marauding wolf prowling the arid wilderness. Wolves tear and scatter, portraying relentless, gnawing loss (<a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Desert wolves hunt at twilight; likewise, Babylon&#8217;s armies would strike when Judah felt most secure (<a href="/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Wolves travel in packs, hinting at multiple waves of enemies&#8212;Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s several campaigns (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant blessing had promised freedom from such beasts if Israel obeyed (<a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>). Their appearance announces the covenant curse triggered by disobedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A leopard will lie in wait near their cities</b><p>Leopards are stealthy ambushers. They blend into surroundings, then spring unexpectedly (<a href="/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Siege warfare reflects this patience: Babylon would encamp, watch, and strike any weak point (<a href="/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; A leopard&#8217;s spots do not change (<a href="/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a>); Judah&#8217;s sin pattern remained unchanged, inviting unchanging consequences.<p>&#8226; Note the escalation: forest, desert, city gate. Judgment closes in until no refuge remains (<a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and everyone who ventures out will be torn to pieces</b><p>The phrase removes any illusion of escape. The safest option&#8212;staying inside city walls&#8212;would still leave people trapped by famine and fear (<a href="/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Venturing out in self-reliance equates to trusting political alliances or idol gods (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>); each attempt would end in ruin.<p>&#8226; The violence is total: &#8220;torn to pieces&#8221; recalls covenant curses where disobedience led to being &#8220;given over to the sword&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For their rebellious acts are many, and their unfaithful deeds are numerous</b><p>God concludes with the root cause, not the symptoms.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Rebellious acts&#8221; points to deliberate, repeated defiance&#8212;breaking Sabbath, oppressing the poor, idol worship (<a href="/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23-31</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Unfaithful deeds&#8221; speaks of covenant infidelity, the relational betrayal that wounds the heart of God (<a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Judgment, then, is not arbitrary; it is a measured response to persistent sin (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11-12</a>; <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a> paints a tiered portrait of divine judgment: lion-like shock, wolf-like attrition, leopard-like ambush, ending in unavoidable loss. Each beast highlights an aspect of Babylon&#8217;s advance, yet the driving force is Judah&#8217;s own accumulated rebellion. The passage reminds us that the God who lovingly covenants with His people also faithfully enforces His righteous standards. Repentance averts wrath; persistence in sin invites the lion, the wolf, and the leopard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">A lion out of the forest.</span>--The imagery is vivid in itself. The three forms of animal ferocity, lion, wolf, leopard--representing, perhaps, the three phases of simple fierceness, ravenousness, and cunning; possibly even three oppressors in whom those attributes were to be impersonated--are brought together to embody the cruelty of the invader.

The same three animals appear in the symbolism of the first canto of Dante's <span class= "ital">Inferno, </span>and the coincidence can hardly be thought of as accidental.<p><span class= "bld">A leopard shall watch . . .</span>--There is no adequate reason for substituting "panther." The leopard finds its place in the <span class= "ital">Fauna </span>of Syria (<a href="/hosea/13-7.htm" title="Therefore I will be to them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:">Hosea 13:7</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm" title="Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.">Habakkuk 1:8</a>). The "watching" is that of the crouching beast making ready for its spring.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - This verse reminds us of a famous passage in the first canto of Dante's 'Commedia,' in which Dante the pilgrim is successively opposed by three wild beasts - a panther, a lion, and a she-wolf. That the poet had Jeremiah in his mind cannot be doubted. The deep knowledge of the Scriptures possessed by medieval theologians (and such was Dante) may put many Protestants to shame. Curiously enough, whereas the early commentators on Dante interpret these wild beasts of vices, the moderns find historical references to nations. On the other hand, while modern expositors explain Jeremiah's wild beasts as symbols of calamities, Rashi and St. Jerome understand them of the Chaldeans, Persians, and Greeks. <span class="cmt_word">A lion out of the forest.</span> The first of a series of figures for the cruel invaders of Judah (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>). The frequent references (see also <a href="/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Jeremiah 50:4</a>) show how common the lion was in the hills and valleys of the land of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">A wolf of the evenings</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a wolf which goes out to seek for prey in the evening. So the Peshito, Targum, Vulgate (comp. "wolves of the evening," <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>). But there is no evidence that '<span class="accented">erebh</span>, evening, has for its plural '<span class="accented">arabhoth</span>, which is, in fact, the regular plural of <span class="accented">arabah</span>, <span class="accented">desert</span>. Render, therefore, <span class="accented">a wolf of the deserts</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. one which has its den in the deserts, and falls upon the cultivated parts when it is hungry. Luther, "the wolf out of the desert." A leopard; rather, <span class="accented">a panther</span>. The Chaldeans are compared to this animal, on account of its swiftness, in <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a lion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_738.htm">Strong's 738: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lion</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the forest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
