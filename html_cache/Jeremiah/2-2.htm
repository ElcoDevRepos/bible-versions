Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, represents the heart of the nation, both politically and spiritually. The phrase underscores the importance of the message, as it is directly from the LORD, highlighting the divine authority behind Jeremiah's words. The act of proclaiming in the hearing of Jerusalem suggests a public declaration meant to reach all inhabitants, emphasizing the communal nature of the message.<p><b>&#8216;I remember the devotion of your youth,</b><br>This phrase reflects God's recollection of Israel's early faithfulness, likely referring to the period following the Exodus when the Israelites first entered into a covenant relationship with God. The term "devotion" indicates a deep, committed love and loyalty, akin to that of a young couple. This period is often idealized as a time of purity and commitment, contrasting with the later unfaithfulness of the nation.<p><b>your love as a bride,</b><br>The imagery of Israel as a bride is a common biblical metaphor, illustrating the intimate and covenantal relationship between God and His people. This metaphor is used to convey the idea of a sacred bond, akin to marriage, where Israel was expected to remain faithful to God. The bridal love signifies initial enthusiasm and dedication, which God cherished and longed to see restored.<p><b>how you followed Me in the wilderness,</b><br>This refers to the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt. Despite the hardships, this period is seen as a time when Israel relied on God for guidance and sustenance. The wilderness journey is symbolic of a testing ground where faith and dependence on God were paramount. It also foreshadows the Christian journey of faith, where believers are called to trust in God through life's challenges.<p><b>in a land not sown.</b><br>The phrase "a land not sown" highlights the barrenness and inhospitable nature of the wilderness. It underscores the miraculous provision of God, who sustained His people in a place where agriculture and self-sufficiency were impossible. This reliance on God for daily needs is a recurring theme in Scripture, pointing to the spiritual truth that God is the ultimate provider. It also serves as a reminder of the Israelites' dependence on God, contrasting with their later self-reliance and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Once, they eagerly followed Him through barren wilderness, relying on His every provision. By remembering, God invites them&#8212;and us&#8212;to return to that first love, renewing wholehearted trust and exclusive allegiance to the Lord who redeemed and sustained them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Go and cry . . .</span>--The scene of the call, was, we may believe, in his home at Anathoth. Now the prophet is sent to begin his work in Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">I remember thee.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I have remembered for thee.</span><p><span class= "bld">The love of thine espousals.</span>--The imagery was one derived, as we find so often in Jeremiah's writings, from the older prophets. It was implied in the "jealous God" of <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>, illustrated by an actual history, which was also a parable, in Hosea 1-3, and after its use by Jeremiah, expanded more fully by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 16). The "espousals" are thought of as coinciding with the great covenant of <a href="/exodus/24-8.htm" title="And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.">Exodus 24:8</a>, when the people solemnly entered into the relation to which God called them. Then the bride was ready to follow her lord and husband even in an "unsown land"--the "waste howling wilderness" of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm" title="He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>. The faithfulness of the past is contrasted with the unfaithfulness of the present.<p><span class= "bld">When thou wentest after me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">thy going after me.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the cars of Jerusalem</span>. Presumably Jeremiah had received his call at Anathoth (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I remember thee</span>, etc.; rather, 1 <span class="accented">remember for thy good the kindness of thy youth</span>. It is an open question whether the "kindness" spoken of is that of God towards the people, or of the people towards God. The usage of the Hebrew (<span class="accented">khesed</span>) admits of either acceptation; comp. for the first, <a href="/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>, 36:5, and many other passages; for the second, <a href="/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4, 6</a> (in ver. 6 rendering for "mercy," "goodness") and <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a> (rendering "men of piety"). But the context, which dwells so strongly on the oblivion into which the Divine benefits had been allowed to pass, is decidedly in favor of the first view. How beautiful is this condescending language! Jehovah's past feelings come Back to him; at least, so it appears to the believer, when God lets the light of his countenance shine forth again (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>). He even condescends to overlook the weakness and inconsistency of the Israel of antiquity. He idealizes it (i.e. Jeremiah is permitted to do so). This is in harmony with other prophetic passages (see <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a> ("as at the first"); <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 3, 4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6-14</a>). The figure of the bride recurs constantly (see <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4, 5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thine espousals</span>;
