In the context of Jeremiah, this tumult refers to the judgment God is pronouncing through the prophet. The imagery of a resounding tumult can be connected to other biblical passages that describe God's voice or actions as powerful and far-reaching, such as <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>, where the voice of the Lord is described as mighty and majestic. The phrase also foreshadows the eschatological themes found in the New Testament, where the final judgment is depicted as a global event (<a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6-7</a>).<p><b>because the LORD brings a charge against the nations</b><br>Here, the LORD is portrayed as a divine judge bringing a legal charge against the nations. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and humanity, where God holds nations accountable for their actions. The concept of God as a judge is prevalent throughout the Old Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/82.htm">Psalm 82:1-8</a>, where God judges among the "gods" or rulers. The nations' accountability underscores the universal sovereignty of God, who is not limited to Israel but is the ruler of all creation. This charge against the nations can also be seen as a precursor to the final judgment described in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<p><b>He brings judgment on all mankind</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, extending to all humanity. It reflects the biblical theme of God's impartiality, as seen in <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6-11</a>, where God is described as rendering to each person according to their deeds, without favoritism. The universality of this judgment highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's justice, which is a recurring theme in prophetic literature.<p><b>and puts the wicked to the sword,&#8217;&#8221; declares the LORD.</b><br>The imagery of the sword is often used in the Bible to symbolize divine judgment and warfare. In this context, it signifies the execution of God's righteous judgment against the wicked. This phrase can be linked to other prophetic declarations of judgment, such as <a href="/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>, where the LORD is described as executing judgment by fire and sword. The declaration by the LORD underscores the certainty and authority of the pronouncement. The sword as a tool of judgment also foreshadows the New Testament depiction of Christ as the one who will ultimately judge the living and the dead (<a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is depicted as the ultimate judge over all nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to all the peoples and kingdoms of the earth, not just Israel, indicating the universal scope of God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who oppose God and His ways, representing individuals and nations that live in rebellion against Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>A symbol of divine judgment and warfare, indicating the means by which God will execute His judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message of impending judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is not just the God of Israel but the God of all nations.

(<a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>)<p>&#8226; Jeremiah pictures a worldwide roar, an uproar so vast that no corner is untouched, echoing the chaos of divine judgment described in <a href="/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17-20</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12-17</a>.<p>&#8226; This is not localized turmoil but a global shaking, aligning with Jesus&#8217; words in <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a> that &#8220;the powers of the heavens will be shaken.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that God&#8217;s actions reverberate universally; no nation or individual can remain insulated when He moves (<a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the LORD brings a charge against the nations.</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;because the LORD brings a charge against the nations.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

underscores accountability: every people&#8212;no matter their power, culture, or borders&#8212;must answer to the same moral law (<a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; It recalls the courtroom scenes of <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2-4</a>, where heaven and earth are summoned as witnesses to humanity&#8217;s rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He brings judgment on all mankind</b><p>&#8220;He brings judgment on all mankind&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226;

Unlike human courts, God&#8217;s judgment is perfectly just and utterly inescapable (<a href="/psalms/96-13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This truth presses believers to sober reflection, while offering hope that wrongs will ultimately be set right (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and puts the wicked to the sword,&#8217;&#8221;

<a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s holiness demands that persistent wickedness be confronted; patience does not cancel justice (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;wicked&#8221; are those who resist God&#8217;s ways; His sword separates righteousness from rebellion, fulfilling the warning of <a href="/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a> that &#8220;the wicked will not go unpunished.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a> paints a vivid, literal picture of global upheaval sparked by God&#8217;s righteous indictment. The tumult rings worldwide because the Lord&#8217;s courtroom encompasses every nation and every person. His universal judgment assures that sin will be answered, and His sword guarantees that entrenched wickedness will not prevail. While sobering, this verse also affirms God&#8217;s unwavering justice and faithfulness to set all things right&#8212;truths that anchor our hope and call us to faithful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">A noise.</span>--i.e., the tumult of an advancing army (<a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm" title="The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts musters the host of the battle.">Isaiah 13:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm" title="Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!">Isaiah 17:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A controversy.</span>--The term properly denotes a legal process, like the "pleading" of <a href="/jeremiah/2-9.htm" title="Why I will yet plead with you, said the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.">Jeremiah 2:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-35.htm" title="Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me.
