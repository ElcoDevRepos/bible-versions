Jonadab commanded his descendants to live a life of simplicity, abstaining from wine, not building houses, and not sowing seed or planting vineyards. This lifestyle was meant to preserve their distinct identity and devotion to God. Their obedience to these commands, even generations later, highlights their commitment to their ancestral traditions and values. This obedience serves as a stark contrast to the disobedience of the people of Judah, who failed to heed God's commands despite His repeated warnings through the prophets.<p><b>but these people have not listened to Me</b><br>In contrast to the Rechabites' faithfulness, the people of Judah repeatedly ignored God's instructions and warnings. This phrase underscores the theme of disobedience that runs throughout the book of Jeremiah. Despite God's persistent calls for repentance through His prophets, the people of Judah continued in their idolatry and sinful practices. This disobedience ultimately led to their downfall and exile. The comparison with the Rechabites serves as a rebuke to Judah, emphasizing that if a human command could be so faithfully observed, how much more should the divine commands of God be followed. This theme of listening and obedience is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are tied to obedience to God's law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonadab_son_of_rechab.htm">Jonadab son of Rechab</a></b><br>An ancestor of the Rechabites, known for his command to his descendants to live a nomadic lifestyle, abstain from wine, and avoid building houses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rechabites.htm">Rechabites</a></b><br>A clan in Israel who faithfully adhered to the commands of their forefather Jonadab, serving as an example of obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often rebuked by God through prophets like Jeremiah for their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_command.htm">God's Command</a></b><br>The divine instructions given to the people of Judah, which they failed to obey, contrasting with the Rechabites' faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god_over_tradition.htm">Obedience to God Over Tradition</a></b><br>The Rechabites' adherence to Jonadab's command serves as a model for prioritizing God's commands over cultural or personal traditions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_small_things.htm">Faithfulness in Small Things</a></b><br>The Rechabites' faithfulness in seemingly minor commands highlights the importance of obedience in all areas of life, not just the significant ones.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contrast_of_obedience_and_disobedience.htm">Contrast of Obedience and Disobedience</a></b><br>The stark contrast between the Rechabites and the people of Judah serves as a reminder of the blessings of obedience and the consequences of disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_faithfulness.htm">Generational Faithfulness</a></b><br>The Rechabites' commitment across generations encourages us to instill and uphold godly values within our families.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_call_to_repentance.htm">God's Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The passage underscores God's desire for His people to return to Him, emphasizing the need for repentance and realignment with His will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_35_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 35:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_35_16_Obedience_to_God.htm">How does Jeremiah 35:16 highlight the importance of obedience to God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Rechabites_faithfulness_7.htm">What lessons can we learn from the Rechabites' faithfulness in Jeremiah 35:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_35_16_Ephesians_6_1_link.htm">How does Jeremiah 35:16 connect with Ephesians 6:1 about honoring authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Rechabites_inspire_Christians_today_2.htm">In what ways can we apply the Rechabites' example to modern Christian living?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_35_16_Faith_steadfastness.htm">How can Jeremiah 35:16 inspire us to remain steadfast in our faith today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_Rechabites_obeyed_but_Israel_didn_t_2.htm">Why did the Rechabites obey their ancestor's command but Israel did not obey God in Jeremiah 35:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_35_16_Obedience_in_faith.htm">What does Jeremiah 35:16 reveal about the importance of obedience in faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Rechabites_obedience_vs_modern_faith.htm">How does the Rechabites' obedience challenge modern believers' commitment to God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_35.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_were_the_rechabites_in_the_bible.htm">Who were the Rechabites in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_jer._35_19_conflict_with_covenant_breaks.htm">Jeremiah 35:19 -

God highlights what He is about to compare. Earlier in the chapter the prophet had set wine before the Rechabites, and they refused it (<a href="/jeremiah/35-5.htm">Jeremiah 35:5&#8211;6</a>). Their obedience is not hypothetical; it is documented fact, already witnessed by Jeremiah and, through his writing, by us. This &#8220;Yes&#8221; says, in effect, &#8220;Look closely&#8212;this really happened.&#8221; Compare the Lord&#8217;s similar use of an emphatic affirmation in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> (&#8220;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign&#8221;) and in <a href="/jeremiah/1-12.htm">Jeremiah 1:12</a> (&#8220;You have seen correctly, for I am watching over My word to accomplish it&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab</b><p>These are the descendants of a faithful ancestor who lived about 250 years earlier (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15&#8211;28</a>). They are nomads within Israelite territory, distinct yet present, and serve here as a foil to the covenant nation. Their heritage mattered: God often points to family lines to underscore continuity of belief&#8212;think of Timothy&#8217;s line through Lois and Eunice (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>) or the faithful descendants of Zadok (<a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>). The Rechabites&#8217; identity is tied to their forefather&#8217;s example; likewise Israel was to see itself as &#8220;sons of Abraham&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>) and live accordingly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>carried out the command their forefather gave them</b><p>Jonadab&#8217;s rule&#8212;no wine, no settled houses&#8212;was not God&#8217;s law, yet his offspring obeyed it scrupulously (<a href="/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Jeremiah 35:8&#8211;10</a>). The Lord applauds their steadfast loyalty, showing that sincere obedience is both observable and possible. Scripture often holds up human examples to shame broader disobedience: consider the Queen of the South rising against an unrepentant generation (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>) or the Ninevites who heeded Jonah (<a href="/matthew/12-41.htm">Matthew 12:41</a>). Faithful practice over centuries demonstrates the power of a righteous legacy (<a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but these people have not listened to Me</b><p>Now comes the divine contrast. Israel, privileged with covenant, priesthood, prophets, and promises, had repeatedly ignored the Lord (<a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>; 25:4&#8211;7). The Rechabites honored a merely human tradition; Israel dishonored the living God. The shock is intentional: external religion without obedience is hollow (<a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6&#8211;8</a>). Jesus later echoes the same indictment when He says, &#8220;Why do you call Me &#8216;Lord, Lord,&#8217; and not do what I say?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>). The greater the revelation, the greater the accountability (<a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a> underscores this piercing truth: if a clan can faithfully keep an ancestor&#8217;s voice for generations, how much more should God&#8217;s covenant people heed the very word of the Lord. The verse is a mirror held to our hearts, reminding us that true devotion is proven in obedient action, not empty profession.
