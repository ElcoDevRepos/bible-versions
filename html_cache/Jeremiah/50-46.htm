Babylon was a powerful empire known for its grandeur and influence, often seen as a symbol of human pride and opposition to God. The capture of Babylon is a fulfillment of prophecy, as foretold by prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>) and Jeremiah himself (<a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>). The fall of Babylon is also a type of the ultimate defeat of evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon represents the world system opposed to God.<p><b>the earth will quake</b><br>The imagery of the earth quaking signifies the magnitude and impact of Babylon's fall. In ancient times, earthquakes were often seen as acts of divine intervention or judgment. This phrase emphasizes the dramatic and far-reaching consequences of Babylon's defeat. It also connects to other biblical instances where the earth quakes in response to God's actions, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>) and during the crucifixion of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>).<p><b>a cry will be heard among the nations</b><br>The fall of Babylon would not only affect the immediate region but would also send shockwaves throughout the known world. The "cry" symbolizes the widespread recognition of Babylon's downfall and the fear and awe it would inspire among other nations. This reflects the interconnectedness of ancient empires and the political and economic implications of such a significant event. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment of all nations, as seen in the eschatological visions of the prophets and the book of Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its wealth, military strength, and idolatry.
