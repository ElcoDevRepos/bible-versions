Babylon was known for its pride and self-sufficiency, often setting itself against God and His people. The term "arrogant one" reflects the city's attitude and its leaders' hubris. In biblical context, pride is consistently condemned (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), and Babylon's arrogance is a recurring theme in prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of God's opposition to pride and His ultimate authority over nations.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD of Hosts,</b><br>The title "Lord GOD of Hosts" emphasizes God's supreme power and command over the heavenly armies. It underscores His ability to execute judgment and fulfill His purposes. This title is often used in contexts where God's might and sovereignty are highlighted, especially in matters of judgment and warfare (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>). It reassures the faithful of God's control over all cosmic and earthly forces.<p><b>for your day has come,</b><br>This phrase indicates the appointed time for Babylon's judgment. In biblical prophecy, the "day" often refers to a specific time of divine intervention or reckoning (<a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1</a>). The certainty of this timing reflects God's sovereign plan and the fulfillment of His prophetic word. Historically, Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians in 539 BC, marking the end of its dominance and fulfilling this prophecy.<p><b>the time when I will punish you.</b><br>The punishment of Babylon is a central theme in Jeremiah's prophecies. This phrase highlights God's role as the righteous judge who holds nations accountable for their actions. The punishment is not arbitrary but a response to Babylon's sins, including idolatry, oppression, and violence against God's people (<a href="/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24</a>). This serves as a warning to all nations and individuals about the consequences of defying God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arrogant_one.htm">The Arrogant One</a></b><br>This refers to Babylon, a powerful empire known for its pride and idolatry.

In every case, judgment follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am against you</b><p>&#8226; Nothing is more sobering than God Himself becoming the adversary. As He said to rebellious Jerusalem earlier, &#8220;I am against you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel repeats the phrase against nations and false prophets (<a href="/ezekiel/5-8.htm">Ezekiel 5:8</a>; 13:8).
