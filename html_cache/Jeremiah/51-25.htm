Mountains often symbolize kingdoms or empires in biblical literature. Babylon, at the height of its power, was seen as a formidable force that dominated the ancient Near East. The imagery of a mountain suggests stability and strength, yet God declares His opposition, indicating that no earthly power is beyond His judgment. This echoes other biblical passages where God opposes proud nations (<a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-17</a>).<p><b>you who devastate the whole earth</b><br>Babylon's conquests and military campaigns had far-reaching impacts, leading to widespread destruction and subjugation of various peoples. Historically, Babylon was known for its military prowess and its role in the exile of the Jewish people. This phrase underscores the extent of Babylon's influence and the resulting devastation, aligning with the biblical theme of divine retribution against oppressive powers (<a href="/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>).<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This declaration emphasizes the authority and certainty of God's pronouncement. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that assures the audience of the divine origin of the message. It reinforces the idea that the judgment against Babylon is not merely a human prediction but a divine decree, ensuring its fulfillment (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>I will stretch out My hand against you</b><br>The imagery of God stretching out His hand signifies direct intervention and judgment. This phrase is reminiscent of God's actions against Egypt during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>), highlighting His power to deliver His people and execute justice. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to bring down even the mightiest empires.<p><b>I will roll you over the cliffs</b><br>This vivid imagery suggests a complete and catastrophic downfall. The idea of being rolled over cliffs conveys the sudden and irreversible nature of Babylon's destruction. It reflects the biblical theme of divine retribution where the proud and powerful are brought low (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>). The metaphor also implies that Babylon's fall will be as dramatic as its rise.<p><b>and turn you into a charred mountain</b><br>The transformation into a "charred mountain" symbolizes total desolation and ruin. Fire is often associated with judgment and purification in the Bible (<a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). This imagery indicates that Babylon will be left in a state of utter destruction, no longer a source of power or influence. It serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of pride and rebellion against God. The prophecy of Babylon's fall is fulfilled historically with its conquest by the Medes and Persians, as recorded in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>Referred to metaphorically as the "destroying mountain," Babylon was a powerful empire known for its military conquests and destruction, particularly of Jerusalem and the Temple in 586 BC.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who declares judgment against Babylon for its pride and destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_earth.htm">The Whole Earth</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the nations and peoples affected by Babylon's conquests and influence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cliffs.htm">The Cliffs</a></b><br>A metaphor for Babylon's seemingly impregnable strength and high position, which God promises to bring down.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and empires, regardless of their power or influence.

The verse assures us that no power&#8212;however towering&#8212;escapes God&#8217;s righteous verdict. His sovereignty guarantees both the downfall of proud empires and the ultimate vindication of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/51.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">O destroying mountain.</span>--Singularly enough the phrase is the same as that which is applied in <a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2Kings 23:13</a> to the Mount of Olives, and is there rendered by the Authorised version as "the Mount of Corruption." It adds to the interest that this name so given appears in the reign of Josiah, and must therefore have been familiar to Jeremiah. There it is applied to the Mount of Olives as having been the centre of the worship of Ashtoreth and Chemosh and Milcom, destroying the faith and life of Israel. Here, not without the thought that the false worship of Babylon was the root of all its evils, the prophet applies it to that city. The use of the term "mountain," literally quite inapplicable, was symbolical of its sovereignty. The latter clause of the verse suggests the idea that the prophet had before him the picture of a volcano.<p><span class= "bld">And will make thee a burnt mountain.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a mountain of burning</span>--either actively, as rolling down its lava and stones to the destruction of all below; or passively, as spent and burnt out. As the sentence describes the doom of Babylon, the latter meaning seems preferable. It is interesting to note the fact that there is an extinct volcano known as <span class= "ital">Koukal </span>(= fire), which rises to a height of 300 feet above the river <span class= "ital">Khabour, </span>in Western Assyria (the Chebar of <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>), consisting of loose lava, scoriae, and ashes. (Rawlinson's <span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies, </span>i. 189.) Possibly the prophet, who had journeyed to the Euphrates, had seen in this the symbol of the "destroying mountain" that destroyed itself. Babylon was for him an extinct volcano.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - Another image for the destruction of Babylon. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O destroying mountain.</span> The description evidently points to a volcano. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Jehovah says that he will roll the mountain down from the rocks, which can only be understood of the stones and lava hurled down from the crater; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he will make it a "mountain of burning," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either to a burning, <span class="accented">or</span>, more forcibly, a burnt out mountain; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that, as a consequence of this, its stones shall be unsuitable for the purposes of the builder. Now, Palestine, it has been clearly made out, "lies almost in the centre of one great volcano region of the earth's surface, that, namely, which includes the basin of the Mediterranean and the provinces of Western or Central Asia. Traces of that volcanic action are found in every direction. The black basaltic rock of the Hauran, the hot springs of Tiberius and Emmaus and Gadara, the naphtha fountains near the Dead Sea, the dykes of porphyry and other volcanic rooks that force their way through the limestone, the many eaves in the limestone rocks themselves, - all these show that we are treading on ground where the forces of the hidden fires of earth have been in times past in active operation. We are, that is, in a zone of earthquakes" (Plumptre, 'Biblical Studies,' p. 136; comp. Pusey's note on Amos 4:11).
