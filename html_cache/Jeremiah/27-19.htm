This title underscores God's power and His ability to fulfill His purposes. It is a reminder of the divine origin of the message, indicating that the following words are not merely human opinion but a direct revelation from God.<p><b>about the pillars</b><br>The pillars mentioned here likely refer to the two bronze pillars, Jachin and Boaz, that stood at the entrance of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-22</a>). These pillars were significant in Israel's worship and symbolized strength and stability. Their mention here indicates their importance and the impending threat to the temple's sacred objects due to the Babylonian invasion.<p><b>the sea</b><br>The "sea" refers to the large bronze basin used for ceremonial washing in the temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>). It was an essential part of the temple's furnishings, symbolizing purification and the cleansing necessary for approaching God. Its mention highlights the impending desecration and loss of sacred items due to the Babylonian conquest.<p><b>the bases</b><br>These bases were the stands for the ten bronze lavers used in the temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27-39</a>). They were intricately designed and part of the temple's elaborate system for ritual purification. Their inclusion in this prophecy underscores the comprehensive nature of the coming destruction and the loss of Israel's religious heritage.<p><b>and the rest of the articles that remain in this city</b><br>This phrase refers to the remaining temple articles that had not yet been taken to Babylon. It indicates that despite previous deportations and plundering, some sacred items still remained in Jerusalem. The prophecy warns of their eventual removal, symbolizing the complete judgment and exile that would come upon Jerusalem, fulfilling earlier prophecies and demonstrating the consequences of the nation's disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
