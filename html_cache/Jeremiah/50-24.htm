In the biblical context, God often uses the imagery of a snare to describe how He traps the wicked (<a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15-16</a>). Babylon, a symbol of pride and idolatry, is being targeted by God for its arrogance and oppression of His people. Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire known for its military might and cultural achievements, yet it was also notorious for its cruelty and idolatry. The snare represents God's sovereign control over nations, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a>, where Babylon's downfall is foretold.<p><b>and you were caught before you knew it</b><br>This highlights the suddenness and unexpected nature of Babylon's downfall. Despite its strength and strategic prowess, Babylon was unable to foresee or prevent its capture. This reflects the biblical theme that human wisdom and power are ultimately futile against God's plans (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>). Historically, Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians under Cyrus the Great in 539 BC, an event that occurred swiftly and unexpectedly, fulfilling prophecies like those in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>.<p><b>You were found and captured</b><br>The phrase underscores the inevitability of divine judgment. Babylon's capture was not just a military defeat but a fulfillment of God's righteous decree. This echoes the biblical principle that God sees all actions and will hold nations accountable (<a href="/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>). The capture of Babylon serves as a type of the ultimate judgment against all worldly powers that oppose God, pointing forward to the eschatological defeat of evil as described in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>.<p><b>because you challenged the LORD</b><br>This phrase identifies the root cause of Babylon's downfall: its defiance against God. Babylon's challenge to the LORD is seen in its idolatry, pride, and persecution of God's people (<a href="/isaiah/47-10.htm">Isaiah 47:10-11</a>). Theologically, this reflects the broader biblical narrative of rebellion against God leading to judgment. Babylon's challenge is reminiscent of other biblical figures who opposed God, such as Pharaoh in Exodus. This serves as a warning to all nations and individuals about the consequences of opposing God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its wealth and military might, often seen as a symbol of pride and opposition to God.

Just as He &#8220;foils the plans of the nations&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>), He ordained the fall of this proud empire. This line reminds us that no power stands outside His sovereignty (<a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O Babylon</b><p>The name calls out a real, historic nation whose capital was once the marvel of the ancient world (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>). It also symbolizes human arrogance throughout Scripture (<a href="/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>).

Cyrus turned aside the waters of the Euphrates into another channel, and entered by the river-bed, so that the city was taken before those who lived in the middle of the city knew that it was attacked (Herod. i. 191). In the latter case the gates were opened to Darius by the treachery of the Babylonian general Zopyrus (Herod. iii. 158). (Comp. <a href="/daniel/5-30.htm" title="In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.">Daniel 5:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;">Isaiah 45:1</a>.) In <a href="/context/jeremiah/51-31.htm" title="One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,">Jeremiah 51:31-32</a> we have the same fact more vividly described.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have laid a snare for thee.</span> It was very natural, as long as Cyrus's own account of the capture of Babylon was unknown, to refer for a fulfilment to the stratagem which, as Herodotus relates, that king employed, viz. diverting the waters of the Euphrates into an already existing reservoir, and entering the city unexpectedly by the river channel (Herod., 1:191). But the cylinder inscription, translated by Sir H. Rawlinson in 1880, shows that Babylon opened its gates of its own accord, on hearing the defeat and capture of Nabonidus. There is no occasion to look for any further fulfilment of the prophecy than the surprise which must ever come upon the bystander when he sees a mighty empire suddenly pass into the hands of its enemies.
