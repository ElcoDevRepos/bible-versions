Historically, it was associated with idolatrous practices, including child sacrifices to the god Molech (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). This valley later became a symbol of judgment and hell in Jewish and Christian thought. Its mention here underscores the severity of the message Jeremiah is to deliver, as it is a place of past abominations and future judgment.<p><b>near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate</b><br>The Potsherd Gate, likely located on the southern side of Jerusalem, was an area where broken pottery was discarded. This gate's name suggests a place of refuse and destruction, symbolizing the brokenness and impending judgment upon Jerusalem. The imagery of broken pottery is significant in Jeremiah's prophecies, representing the fragility and impending shattering of the nation (<a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-11</a>).<p><b>Proclaim there the words I speak to you</b><br>Jeremiah is instructed to deliver God's message at this specific location, emphasizing the public and undeniable nature of the prophecy. The act of proclaiming in a significant location highlights the seriousness of the message and serves as a visual and auditory warning to the people. This command reflects the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, delivering His words with authority and urgency (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>).

(See Note on <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; and <a href="/matthew/27-7.htm" title="And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.">Matthew 27:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">By the entry of the east gate.</span>--The Hebrew word is obscure. The Authorised Version adopts a doubtful etymology, connecting the word with the sun (so "sun gate" in the margin) and therefore with the East. Luther, with the Vulgate and most modern scholars, renders it as "the potter's gate," or more literally, <span class= "ital">the gate of pottery. </span>The LXX. treats it as a proper name, and gives "the gate Kharsith." No such fate appears in the topographical descriptions of Nehemiah 2, 3; and the two gates which led into the valley of Hinnom were the Fountain and the Dung gate (<a href="/context/nehemiah/3-13.htm" title="The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall to the dung gate.">Nehemiah 3:13-15</a>). Hence it has been inferred that this was a small postern gate leading into the valley just at the point where it was filled with rubbish, possibly with broken fragments like those which were now to be added to it. On this supposition the connection both of the name of the gate and its use with the symbolism of the prophet's act may have determined the command which was thus given him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The valley of the son of Hinnom</span> (see on Jeremiah 7:31). <span class="cmt_word">The east gate</span>; rather <span class="accented">the potsherd gate</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gate where potsherds were wont to be thrown. Another possible rendering is "sun gate," of which "east gate" is but a paraphrase. But there is evidently a connection between the name of the gate and the action performed by Jeremiah. The Authorized Version seems to have misled Captain Warren into identifying the valley of Hinnom with that of Kedron. He confirms his view, it is true, by the Arabic nomenclature, which speaks of the Kedron as the Wady Jehinnam - a nomenclature, however, which is by no means uniform (see Robinson, 'Biblical Researches,' 2:396, 403). The situation of the "potsherd gate" must remain uncertain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1433;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
