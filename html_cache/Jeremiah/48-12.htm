It emphasizes God's sovereignty and the inevitability of His plans. The phrase "the days are coming" is often used in the prophetic literature to signal impending judgment or fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in other passages like <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, which speaks of a new covenant.<p><b>when I will send to him wanderers</b><br>"Wanderers" here likely refers to invaders or marauders, possibly the Babylonians, who were known for their military campaigns and conquests. This reflects the historical context of the Babylonian Empire's expansion under Nebuchadnezzar II. The term suggests a sense of instability and disruption, as wanderers are not settled but move from place to place, bringing chaos.<p><b>who will pour him out</b><br>This imagery of pouring out suggests a complete emptying or desolation. It is symbolic of judgment and destruction, akin to the pouring out of wrath seen in other prophetic texts like <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>. The act of pouring out can also be seen as a metaphor for God's judgment being thorough and exhaustive.<p><b>They will empty his vessels</b><br>The vessels likely symbolize the wealth, resources, or people of Moab. In ancient times, vessels were used to store valuable commodities, so emptying them signifies a stripping away of prosperity and security. This can be connected to the broader theme of divine retribution against nations that oppose God's will, as seen in the judgment against Babylon in <a href="/jeremiah/51-34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>.<p><b>and shatter his jars</b><br>Shattering jars indicates total destruction and irreparability. In the cultural context, jars were essential for daily life, used for storing water, oil, and grain. The shattering signifies not just loss but a complete breakdown of societal and economic structures. This imagery is reminiscent of the potter's vessel in <a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>, symbolizing how God can break nations as easily as a potter breaks a flawed pot.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and surrounding nations, including Moab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation east of the Jordan River, often in conflict with Israel.
