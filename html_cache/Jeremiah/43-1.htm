This phrase indicates the completion of a prophetic message, emphasizing Jeremiah's role as a faithful messenger. The context here is post-exilic, where the remnant of Judah is seeking guidance. Jeremiah's role as a prophet is crucial, as he serves as a conduit for divine communication, similar to other prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>all the words of the LORD their God</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of Jeremiah's message. The words are not his own but are from the LORD, highlighting the authority and authenticity of the prophecy. The use of "the LORD their God" reinforces the covenant relationship between God and Israel, reminding the people of their unique identity and responsibilities. This is consistent with the Deuteronomic emphasis on obedience to God's commands.<p><b>everything that the LORD had sent him to say</b><br>This indicates the completeness and thoroughness of the message delivered by Jeremiah. It suggests that nothing was omitted, reflecting Jeremiah's obedience and integrity as a prophet. The phrase also implies that the message was divinely appointed, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty in guiding His people.
