The mention of "children" suggests that the practice of idol worship was so ingrained in the culture that it was passed down through generations. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where God warns that the iniquity of the fathers will be visited upon the children. The altars symbolize places of worship dedicated to false gods, indicating a departure from the worship of Yahweh. This generational memory of idolatry underscores the pervasive influence of sin and the challenge of breaking free from cultural and familial patterns of disobedience.<p><b>and Asherah poles</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often erected near altars dedicated to Baal. These poles were a direct violation of God's commandments, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>, which forbids the planting of any tree as an Asherah beside the altar of the Lord. The presence of these poles indicates a syncretism where the worship of Yahweh was mixed with pagan practices. This reflects the spiritual adultery of the people, as they turned to other gods, forsaking their covenant relationship with the Lord. The Asherah poles serve as a reminder of the seductive nature of idolatry and the need for spiritual purity.<p><b>by the green trees</b><br>The reference to "green trees" suggests locations that were considered sacred in pagan worship. These sites were often chosen for their natural beauty and were believed to be dwelling places of deities. In biblical times, high places and groves were commonly used for idol worship, as they were thought to be closer to the gods. This practice is condemned in various scriptures, such as <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>, where it is noted that Judah built high places, sacred stones, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree. The use of green trees in idol worship highlights the corruption of God's creation for purposes contrary to His will.<p><b>and on the high hills</b><br>High hills were frequently chosen as sites for idol worship due to their elevation, which was thought to bring worshippers closer to the divine. This practice is repeatedly condemned in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10-11</a>, where the Israelites set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill. The high places became centers of idolatry and were a significant stumbling block for the people of Israel and Judah. The use of high hills for worship reflects a misunderstanding of God's omnipresence and a reliance on human traditions rather than divine commandments. This phrase serves as a call to return to the true worship of God, who is not confined to any location.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_israel.htm">Children of Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of the Israelites who have inherited the practices and idolatry of their ancestors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars.htm">Altars</a></b><br>Structures built for worship, often used in the context of idol worship in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah_poles.htm">Asherah Poles</a></b><br>Wooden symbols associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, representing idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/green_trees.htm">Green Trees</a></b><br>Locations often associated with pagan worship practices, symbolizing fertility and life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_hills.htm">High Hills</a></b><br>Elevated places where idol worship was commonly practiced, signifying a place of spiritual significance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.

The thought expressed is that every locality that could be used for idolatrous worship made them "remember" that worship, and set about reproducing it. By some interpreters the clause is rendered, <span class= "ital">as they remember their children so do they their altars and their groves; i.e., </span>their idols are as dear to them as their offspring. The former construction is, however, the more natural, and is best supported by the versions.<p><span class= "bld">Groves.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as throughout the Old Testament, when connected with idolatry, the wooden columns that were the symbols of the Ph?nician goddess Asherah, possibly the same as Astarte (<a href="/exodus/34-13.htm" title="But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm" title="For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.">1Kings 14:23</a>). The "green trees" suggested the thought of this worship--for the Asherah, though not a grove, was generally connected with one--as the "high hills" did that of the altars. Commonly the worship is described as "<span class= "ital">under </span>every green tree." Here a different preposition is used, "<span class= "ital">on </span>the green trees," connecting them with the verb "remember."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whilst their children remember</span>, etc. The connection of this with the preceding verse is rather obscure. Probably it is intended as an exemplification of the "sin of Judah," the inveterateness of which is shown by their thoughts spontaneously turning to the altars and symbols of the false gods whenever they are near a leafy tree or a high hill (probably "under the green trees" <span class="accented">is</span> the right reading; comp. <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; so Targum).
