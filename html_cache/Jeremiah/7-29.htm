This act symbolized the nation's shame and the severing of their covenant relationship with God. The Nazarite vow, which involved not cutting one's hair, further emphasizes the significance of this action as a reversal of dedication to God (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). The cutting of hair here is a prophetic gesture indicating the end of God's favor and protection.<p><b>Raise up a lamentation on the barren heights,</b><br>The barren heights refer to the high places where idolatrous worship often occurred. These locations, once filled with pagan altars, are now desolate, symbolizing the spiritual barrenness of the people. Lamentation is a common biblical response to disaster or divine judgment, as seen in the Book of Lamentations. The call to lament on these heights underscores the depth of Israel's spiritual decline and the consequences of their idolatry.<p><b>for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine judgment upon the people of Judah. The rejection and forsaking by the LORD highlight the severity of their disobedience and idolatry.

This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of breaking the covenant.
