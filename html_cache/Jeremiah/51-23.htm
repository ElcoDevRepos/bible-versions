In biblical times, shepherds were responsible for the care and guidance of their sheep, symbolizing leadership and authority. The shattering of the shepherd and flock indicates a complete dismantling of leadership and the scattering of the people. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where God promises to judge the shepherds of Israel for their failures. The shepherd motif is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), contrasting the failed leadership of human shepherds.<p><b>with you I shatter the farmer and his oxen;</b><br>The farmer and his oxen represent the agricultural backbone of society, essential for sustenance and economic stability. In ancient cultures, agriculture was a primary occupation, and the destruction of this relationship signifies economic collapse and famine. This imagery underscores the totality of God's judgment, affecting every aspect of life. The breaking of the farmer and oxen can be seen as a reversal of the blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>, where obedience to God results in prosperity for the land and livestock. The judgment here serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>with you I shatter the governors and officials.</b><br>Governors and officials represent the political and administrative structures of a nation. The shattering of these figures indicates the dismantling of governmental authority and order. This reflects the historical context of Babylon's fall, as prophesied by Jeremiah, where the once-mighty empire would be brought to ruin. The destruction of political leaders is a common theme in prophetic literature, emphasizing God's sovereignty over nations and rulers. This theme is echoed in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God is described as the one who "removes kings and sets up kings," highlighting His ultimate control over human affairs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and the surrounding nations.

Yet in the very next verse the Lord promises to repay Babylon for its cruelty (51:24), reminding readers that He both appoints instruments of discipline and later judges them. The verse therefore testifies to God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty: He directs history, uses whom He wills, and ultimately defends His covenant people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/51.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">With thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.</span>--The exhausting of all sorts and conditions of men culminates in the ruling caste.
