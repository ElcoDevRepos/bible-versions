In biblical literature, "the words" often signify a direct revelation from God, underscoring the seriousness and authenticity of the prophecy.<p><b>that the LORD spoke</b><br>The use of "the LORD" (YHWH) highlights the covenantal relationship between God and His people. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate source of prophecy. This phrase assures the audience that the message is not from human origin but from God Himself, reinforcing its reliability and divine authority.<p><b>concerning Israel and Judah.</b><br>This specifies the recipients of the prophecy, indicating that the message pertains to both the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). Historically, after the division of the united monarchy, Israel and Judah often had separate destinies. However, this prophecy unites them, suggesting a future restoration and reconciliation. This dual mention also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's plan for all His people, regardless of their historical divisions. The prophecy can be seen as a precursor to the New Covenant, where unity is found in Christ, transcending previous separations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks through His prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people of Israel and Judah during a time of impending judgment and future restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the northern kingdom, which had already been taken into captivity by Assyria at the time of Jeremiah's prophecy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom, which was facing imminent judgment and exile by Babylon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophecy_of_restoration.htm">Prophecy of Restoration</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/30.htm">Jeremiah 30</a> is a message of hope and future restoration for both Israel and Judah, despite their current circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite the current judgment, God remains sovereign and faithful to His promises.

Just as Israel could trust the Lord&#8217;s past covenant words (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>), they can rely on what is about to be unveiled regarding their future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD spoke</b><p>- The speaker is &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; the covenant name pointing to the One who delivered Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14&#8211;15</a>). His proven character guarantees the reliability of the message (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>- Jeremiah&#8217;s entire ministry is framed by the certainty that &#8220;the LORD put out His hand and touched my mouth&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). Here again, divine authorship underscores both authority and comfort: God Himself&#8212;not a mere human authority&#8212;takes responsibility for these coming declarations.<p>- New-covenant writers echo this truth: &#8220;Men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). The verse therefore invites us to listen with reverence and expectation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>concerning Israel and Judah</b><p>- The message applies to the whole covenant people&#8212;both the northern tribes (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). Though divided politically since Rehoboam, they remain one family in God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-11.htm">Hosea 1:11</a>).<p>- The wording hints at future reunification and restoration: &#8220;I will bring them back to the land I gave their fathers&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>). <a href="/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15-22</a> pictures the two sticks&#8212;Israel and Judah&#8212;becoming &#8220;one nation under one king.&#8221;<p>- This dual address guards against the idea that only a remnant of Judah will be restored. God&#8217;s plan embraces all twelve tribes, culminating in the &#8220;whole house of Israel&#8221; being saved (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>) and gathered to worship under Messiah&#8217;s righteous rule (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-6.htm">Zechariah 10:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/30-4.htm">Jeremiah 30:4</a> functions as a title line announcing a trustworthy, divine proclamation that spans both fractured halves of God&#8217;s covenant people. Because the words are God&#8217;s own, they carry absolute authority; because they are directed to Israel and Judah together, they guarantee a comprehensive future restoration. The verse invites every reader to receive the following promises with confidence, knowing the faithful Lord will fulfill every detail He has spoken.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/30-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
