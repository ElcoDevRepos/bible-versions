In ancient times, an iron stylus was used for engraving on hard surfaces, symbolizing that the sin is deeply embedded and not easily erased. This reflects the stubbornness and persistence of Judah's rebellion against God. The use of an iron stylus suggests a deliberate and unrepentant nature of their actions, highlighting the gravity of their idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>engraved with a diamond point</b><br>The mention of a diamond point emphasizes the hardness and durability of the inscription. Diamonds, being one of the hardest known materials, signify that the sin is not only deeply inscribed but also enduring. This imagery suggests that Judah's sin is not superficial but deeply rooted in their character and culture. The use of such a tool indicates that their iniquity is not easily removed, requiring divine intervention for true cleansing.<p><b>on the tablets of their hearts</b><br>This phrase suggests that the sin is internalized, affecting the very core of the people's being. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of will, emotion, and intellect. By stating that the sin is on the tablets of their hearts, it implies that the people of Judah have embraced sin at a fundamental level, affecting their thoughts, desires, and decisions. This internalization of sin contrasts with the new covenant promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people.<p><b>and on the horns of their altars</b><br>The horns of the altar were significant in Israelite worship, symbolizing strength and refuge. By stating that sin is engraved on the horns of their altars, it indicates that even their places of worship are tainted by iniquity. This suggests a corruption of religious practices, where idolatry and false worship have infiltrated what should be sacred. The altars, meant for sacrifices to God, have become places of sin, reflecting a broader spiritual decay. This imagery underscores the need for genuine repentance and a return to true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which often fell into idolatry and sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/iron_stylus_and_diamond_point.htm">Iron Stylus and Diamond Point</a></b><br>Metaphors used to describe the permanence and depth of Judah's sin, indicating that their iniquity is deeply ingrained.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tablet_of_their_hearts.htm">Tablet of Their Hearts</a></b><br>Symbolizes the inner being or conscience of the people, suggesting that their sin is not just external but internalized.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/horns_of_their_altars.htm">Horns of Their Altars</a></b><br>Refers to the altars used for sacrifices, indicating that their places of worship are tainted by sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_depth_of_sin.htm">The Depth of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just a surface issue but is deeply ingrained in the human heart.

The words describe a note of infamy that could not be erased, and this was stamped in upon the tablets of the heart (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.">2Corinthians 3:3</a>), and blazoned upon the "horns of the altars" of their false worship, or of the true worship of Jehovah which they had polluted and rendered false. The plural "altars" points probably to the former. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sin of Judah</span>, etc. "Judah's sin" is not merely their tendency to sin, but their sinful practices - their idolatry. This is said to be <span class="cmt_word">graven upon the table of their heart</span>, for it is no mere form, but carried on with passionate earnestness, and as indelible as if engraved <span class="cmt_word">with an iron pen.</span> How unlike, however, is this record to that of which the same expression is used in <a href="/job/19-24.htm">Job 19:24</a>! <span class="cmt_word">With the point of a diamond</span>; or, <span class="accented">with a point of adamant</span> (harder than flint, as <a href="/ezekiel/3-9.htm">Ezekiel 3:9</a> says). Fragments of adamant, says Pliny ('Hist.

Those erected for the worship of idols or the two in the temple of Jehovah, which had been defiled by idolatry? And why is the sin of Judah said to be engraved upon the horns of the altars? Probably because the "horns," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the projections at the four upper corners (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>) were smeared with the blood of the victims.
