Historically, the Chaldeans were a Semitic people who settled in southern Babylonia. Babylon, under Chaldean rule, became a dominant empire, known for its wealth and power. The prophecy of their fall is significant as it demonstrates God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to bring down even the mightiest empires. This judgment is a fulfillment of earlier prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13 and 47</a>, where Babylon's downfall is foretold. The fall of Babylon serves as a type of the ultimate defeat of evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon symbolizes the world system opposed to God.<p><b>and pierced through in her streets</b><br>The imagery of being "pierced through" suggests a violent and decisive defeat. The streets of Babylon, once bustling with life and commerce, will become scenes of destruction and death. This reflects the completeness of God's judgment, leaving no place untouched. The streets, often places of public life and interaction, symbolize the heart of the city, indicating that the judgment will penetrate to the core of Babylon's society. This can be seen as a parallel to the final judgment described in Revelation, where the world system is thoroughly judged and found wanting. The piercing also echoes the suffering of Christ, who was pierced for humanity's transgressions, highlighting the contrast between the judgment of the wicked and the redemption offered through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and surrounding nations, including Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldeans.htm">Chaldeans</a></b><br>An ancient people who lived in southern Babylonia.

The picture is blunt: real deaths on a massive scale. God is not describing a symbolic defeat; He is announcing literal judgment. Earlier, He had said, &#8220;Therefore her young men will fall in the streets&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/50-30.htm">Jeremiah 50:30</a>), echoing the same certainty. Much like the flood in <a href="/bsb/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a> or the overthrow of Sodom in <a href="/bsb/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, the Lord&#8217;s warnings move from prophecy to palpable history. <a href="/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a> later mirrors this certainty over end-times Babylon: &#8220;she will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.&#8221; The message rings clear&#8212;when God pronounces judgment, it happens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land of the Chaldeans</b><p>The Chaldeans were the Babylonian empire&#8217;s heartland. God aims His judgment at the very soil that seemed untouchable. Earlier, He promised, &#8220;I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/50-18.htm">Jeremiah 50:18</a>). <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a> prophesied likewise: &#8220;Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms&#8230; will be overthrown by God.&#8221; By pinpointing &#8220;the land of the Chaldeans,&#8221; the Lord shows that no empire, however advanced or self-secure, can sidestep His authority. Babylon had conquered Jerusalem (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>), yet the conqueror will become the conquered because God defends His covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and pierced through</b><p>The phrase intensifies the previous line&#8212;those who fall will be &#8220;pierced through,&#8221; not merely injured but fatally struck. Ezekiel uses similar imagery when God says of Egypt&#8217;s warriors, &#8220;the slain will fall in your midst&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/30-4.htm">Ezekiel 30:4</a>). Such wording underlines finality; there will be no recovery or second chance. Spiritual takeaway: persistent pride invites decisive discipline. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> reminds us, &#8220;Pride goes before destruction.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in her streets</b><p>Judgment reaches public spaces&#8212;&#8220;her streets.&#8221; Babylon prided itself on impressive boulevards and city planning, yet those very avenues will witness its downfall. <a href="/jeremiah/51-43.htm">Jeremiah 51:43</a> adds, &#8220;Her cities have become a desolation, a dry and arid land where no one lives.&#8221; The streets once echoing with commerce and revelry will echo with silence and lament. <a href="/revelation/18-22.htm">Revelation 18:22</a> pictures the same: &#8220;No music of harpists, musicians, flutists, or trumpeters will ever be heard in you again.&#8221; The lesson is sobering: worldly splendor cannot shield from divine reckoning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/51-4.htm">Jeremiah 51:4</a> promises literal, visible judgment on Babylon&#8212;a once-dominant culture undone because it exalted itself against the Lord and oppressed His people. Every phrase intensifies the certainty: real deaths, in the very heartland of the Chaldeans, by fatal blows, witnessed on their celebrated streets. God&#8217;s sovereignty over nations, His faithfulness to Israel, and His intolerance of pride converge to assure believers that evil empires never have the last word; the Lord does.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In her streets;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the streets of Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/51-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they will fall</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
