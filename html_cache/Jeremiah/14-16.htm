These prophets claimed peace and safety, contrary to Jeremiah's warnings of impending judgment. The context is a time of national crisis, with Babylon threatening Judah. The people preferred the comforting lies of false prophets over the hard truth from Jeremiah, reflecting a recurring biblical theme of people rejecting God's true messengers (e.g., <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p><b>will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem</b><br>This imagery of bodies being cast into the streets signifies utter devastation and disgrace. In ancient Near Eastern culture, proper burial was crucial, and to be left unburied was a sign of divine curse and shame (<a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>). Jerusalem, the holy city, becomes a place of horror, fulfilling the warnings of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a> about the consequences of disobedience to God.<p><b>because of famine and sword</b><br>Famine and sword are common judgments from God in the Old Testament, often used to bring a nation to repentance (<a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25-26</a>). The famine indicates a siege, where food supplies are cut off, while the sword represents military defeat. These judgments are consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, showing the seriousness of breaking the covenant with God.<p><b>There will be no one to bury them</b><br>The lack of burial is a further sign of judgment and chaos. In Jewish culture, burial was a sacred duty, and failure to bury the dead was a profound dishonor (<a href="/psalms/79-3.htm">Psalm 79:3</a>). This situation underscores the total collapse of societal norms and the overwhelming nature of the disaster.<p><b>or their wives, their sons or their daughters</b><br>The inclusion of family members highlights the comprehensive nature of the judgment. It affects all demographics, showing that sin's consequences are far-reaching and indiscriminate. This reflects the biblical principle that sin impacts not just the individual but the community and family (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>).<p><b>I will pour out their own evil upon them</b><br>This phrase indicates divine retribution, where God allows the consequences of the people's sins to return upon them.

The Lord declares that the very audience comforted by these lies will suffer judgment. Their misplaced trust exposes a timeless warning: believing error never shields anyone from truth.

Public streets&#8212;once bustling with daily life&#8212;become open graves. Scripture often shows that persistent sin turns places of blessing into scenes of desolation (<a href="/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of famine and sword</b><p>The twin disasters explain how bodies fill the streets:<p>&#8226; Famine&#8212;the slow, crushing consequence of siege (<a href="/2_kings/25-2.htm">2 Kings 25:2-3</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Sword&#8212;the swift, violent stroke of invading armies (<a href="/jeremiah/5-17.htm">Jeremiah 5:17</a>; 24:10).<p>Both judgments had been clearly foretold if covenant faithfulness was abandoned (<a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25-26</a>).
