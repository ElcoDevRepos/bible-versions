It is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to signify that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. This underscores the importance and reliability of the message that follows. In the context of Jeremiah, it reassures the people of Judah that despite their current circumstances, God is still speaking and has a plan for them.<p><b>who made the earth</b><br>This phrase highlights God's role as the Creator, affirming His power and authority over all creation. It connects to <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God is depicted as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. This serves as a reminder of God's omnipotence and His ability to bring about His promises. It also implies that the One who created the earth has the power to restore and renew it, which is a central theme in the book of Jeremiah.<p><b>the LORD who formed it and established it</b><br>Here, the emphasis is on God's intentionality and purpose in creation. The verbs "formed" and "established" suggest a deliberate and thoughtful act, indicating that the world is not a product of chance but of divine design. This can be linked to <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>, where God declares that He did not create the earth to be empty but formed it to be inhabited. It reassures the audience of God's ongoing involvement and care for His creation.<p><b>the LORD is His name</b><br>This phrase asserts the identity of God as Yahweh, the covenant-keeping God of Israel. It is a reminder of His eternal nature and His faithfulness to His promises. The use of "the LORD" (Yahweh) connects to <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where God reveals His name to Moses as "I AM WHO I AM," signifying His self-existence and unchanging nature. This assures the people that the same God who delivered them from Egypt is still with them and will fulfill His covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and self-existent nature.
