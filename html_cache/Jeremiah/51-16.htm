The imagery of thunder and roaring waters symbolizes God's might and authority, often associated with His judgment and presence. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, deities were often linked to natural phenomena, but here, the true God is depicted as the ultimate authority over all creation, distinguishing Him from pagan gods.<p><b>He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth.</b><br>This highlights God's control over the natural order, suggesting His omnipresence and omnipotence. The phrase "ends of the earth" signifies the vastness of God's reach, indicating that there is no part of creation outside His influence. This can be connected to <a href="/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11-12</a>, where God is described as directing the clouds and orchestrating the weather. The rising clouds also symbolize God's provision and care, as they bring rain essential for life.<p><b>He generates the lightning with the rain</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates the interconnectedness of natural elements under God's command. Lightning and rain are often seen as manifestations of God's power and blessing. In biblical times, rain was crucial for agriculture and survival, and its provision was seen as a sign of God's favor. The combination of lightning and rain can also be seen as a demonstration of God's ability to bring both judgment and mercy, as lightning can be destructive, while rain is life-giving.<p><b>and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.</b><br>The wind is portrayed as another element under God's control, stored and released according to His will. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>, which speaks of God bringing forth the wind from His treasuries. The concept of "storehouses" suggests that God has an abundant supply of resources, further emphasizing His sovereignty and provision. Wind, like other elements, serves multiple purposes in Scripture, symbolizing the Spirit of God, His breath of life, and His power to enact change and movement in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel. He is the author of the Book of Jeremiah, which includes warnings to the nations and promises of hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a> is a prophecy against Babylon, a powerful empire known for its conquest of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem. This chapter foretells Babylon's downfall as a demonstration of God's sovereignty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_creation.htm">God's Creation</a></b><br>The verse highlights God's control over natural elements like thunder, rain, and wind, emphasizing His power and authority over creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>This verse reminds us that God is in control of all creation.

We should trust in His promises and commands, knowing they are backed by His omnipotence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment_and_mercy.htm">God's Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>While the context of this verse is a prophecy of judgment against Babylon, it also serves as a reminder of God's justice and mercy. He judges nations but also offers redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>The imagery of God bringing rain and wind from His storehouses can be seen as a metaphor for His provision. We can trust that God will supply our needs according to His riches.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_god's_presence.htm">Awareness of God's Presence</a></b><br>Recognizing God's hand in the natural world can deepen our awareness of His presence in our daily lives.

Scripture insists this is God&#8217;s personal doing, not random chance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> echoes the line word-for-word, tying cloud formation to God&#8217;s hands.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/18-44.htm">1 Kings 18:44</a> shows a prophetic glimpse: &#8220;A cloud as small as a man&#8217;s hand is rising from the sea,&#8221; signaling the downpour God promised through Elijah.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/38-24.htm">Job 38:24</a> asks, &#8220;What way is the light dispersed, or the east wind scattered over the earth?&#8221;&#8212;another reminder that weather obeys its Creator.<p>Takeaway: The cycle that waters the planet is evidence of God&#8217;s orderly care; Judah&#8217;s exiles could trust that the One who brings the clouds will also bring their redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He generates the lightning with the rain</b><p>In one seamless movement the flash and the shower are linked. The verse treats both as consciously &#8220;generated&#8221; by God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>: &#8220;Ask the LORD for rain in the season of spring rain. It is the LORD who makes the storm clouds, and He gives showers of rain and plants of the field to everyone.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/37-3.htm">Job 37:3</a> speaks of lightning released &#8220;under the whole heavens,&#8221; reinforcing that it is dispatched, not accidental.<p>&#8226; The blend of lightning (which can be destructive) and rain (which sustains life) displays God&#8217;s right both to judge Babylon and to bless His people.<p>Takeaway: Every flash in the sky is a reminder that blessing and judgment are in God&#8217;s hands alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and brings forth the wind from His storehouses</b><p>Ancient grain was kept in storehouses; here, winds are pictured the same way&#8212;ready to be loosed at God&#8217;s command.<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>: &#8220;For behold, He who forms the mountains, who creates the wind&#8230; the LORD God Almighty is His name.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> repeats, &#8220;He brings the wind out of His storehouses,&#8221; underscoring a deliberate release, not mere atmospheric happenstance.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah later describes God summoning destructive winds against Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1-2</a>), directly tying the poetry of v. 16 to the coming historical event.<p>Takeaway: Whether gentle breeze or hurricane, wind moves only when God opens the door&#8212;another proof that the downfall of empires is under His control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/51-16.htm">Jeremiah 51:16</a> paints a four-part storm scene to proclaim that every element of creation&#8212;thunder, clouds, lightning, wind&#8212;is personally directed by the Lord. This literal dominion over weather shatters the illusion that idols or empires wield ultimate power. For Judah, it meant hope: the God who commands the skies would also bring Babylon down and restore His people. For us, the verse is a vivid call to rest in the sovereignty of the Creator who still speaks through every rumble of thunder and every gust of wind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/51-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When He thunders,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;q&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
