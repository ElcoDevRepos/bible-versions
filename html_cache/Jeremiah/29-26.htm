The mention of Jehoiada, a notable priest during the reign of King Joash, evokes a historical context where priests played crucial roles in guiding the kings and the people. Jehoiada was known for his faithfulness and leadership, which implies that the new appointee is expected to uphold similar standards. This transition of priestly authority reflects the ongoing need for spiritual leadership in Israel, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>to be the chief officer in the house of the LORD</b><br>The role of "chief officer" in the temple signifies a position of significant authority and responsibility. The temple, as the central place of worship, required strict oversight to maintain purity and order. This position would involve managing temple activities, ensuring proper worship practices, and safeguarding the sanctity of the temple. The house of the LORD, or the temple, is a symbol of God's presence among His people, and the chief officer's role is crucial in maintaining this sacred space.<p><b>responsible for any madman who acts like a prophet</b><br>This phrase addresses the issue of false prophets, a recurring problem in Israel's history. The term "madman" suggests someone who is not genuinely inspired by God but claims prophetic authority. The responsibility to discern true prophecy from falsehood is critical, as false prophets could lead the people astray. This task requires wisdom and discernment, qualities that are emphasized in other scriptures, such as in the warnings against false prophets in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a> and the New Testament's exhortations to test the spirits (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>).<p><b>you must put him in stocks and neck irons</b><br>The use of stocks and neck irons indicates a form of punishment and public humiliation for those who falsely claim prophetic authority. This reflects the seriousness with which false prophecy was regarded, as it could undermine the community's faith and lead to idolatry or rebellion against God. Such measures were intended to protect the community from spiritual deception and maintain the integrity of true prophetic messages. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's judgment against falsehood and the protection of His truth, as seen in the actions against false prophets throughout the scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who appoints leaders and gives instructions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>A religious leader in Israel, responsible for maintaining the spiritual and ceremonial order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>A former priest whose position is being replaced, indicating a change in leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_the_lord.htm">House of the LORD</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship and religious authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/madman/prophet.htm">Madman/Prophet</a></b><br>Refers to those who falsely claim prophetic authority, causing disorder.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_and_responsibility.htm">Authority and Responsibility</a></b><br>God appoints leaders with specific roles and responsibilities.

God had not spoken through Shemaiah, just as He had not endorsed Jeroboam&#8217;s counterfeit priesthood (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>).<p>&#8226; By invoking &#8220;the LORD,&#8221;

The verse warns that every attempt to usurp God&#8217;s ordained order and silence His Word invites His decisive judgment, while faithful messengers, though mocked and chained, remain vindicated by the Lord who truly appoints.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">The Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada . . .</span>--The priest so named had apparently been deposed, as not favouring the stringent policy of the party of revolt.

On the punishment of the stocks, see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm" title="Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 20:2</a>.

Some (Grotius, Hitzig, Graf) think that this Jehoiada was the famous high priest of that name, who is said to have "appointed <span class="accented">officers</span> over the house of the Lord" (<a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18</a>). It is true that Zephaniah was not literally the successor of Jehoiada, but he was so in the same metaphorical sense in which the scribes are said by our Lord to "sit in Moses' seat" (<a href="/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2</a>). It is safer, however, to suppose that another Jehoiada is meant, of whom we have no further information. It is not said that either Jehoiada or Zephaniah was high priest, and as the special object of the elevation of the latter is said to be the supervision of the temple police, it is more probable that Jehoiada and he were successively "second priests," or, to use a phrase which seems to be synonymous, "deputy governors in the house of the Lord" (<a href="/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>). The passage may thus without violence be harmonized with <a href="/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, where Seraiah is called "the chief priest" and Zephaniah "the second priest." It is possible that Jehoiada 'had been favorable to the better class of prophets. In this case there will be a delicate hint to Zephaniah that God had his own purpose in promoting him to honor, viz. that unruly prophets like Jeremiah might be held in with a tighter hand (Ewald). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should be officers</span>; rather, that <span class="accented">there should be officers</span>. Zephaniah himself was an "officer" or "deputy" (see above); but he was also "chief in the house of the Lord," and had the appointment of inferior "officers," whose duty it was to preserve order in the temple. To understand the following words, we must remember that the outer court of the temple was a favorite place for prophetic teaching (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to keep an eye upon "madmen" and prophetizers. The term "mad" is used in a disparaging sense (as <a href="/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>; comp. <a href="/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>), with regard to the apparently senseless behavior of those who were overpowered by the spirit of prophecy. In earlier times, no doubt, the phenomena of prophecy were more violently opposed to everyday life than in Jeremiah's time; but such symbolic acts as appearing in public with a yoke upon his neck would at least excuse the application of the epithet even to Jeremiah. It is more than probable, however, that it was not so much the abnormal actions as the contents of Jeremiah's prophecies which stirred up such vehement opposition; observe how in the next verse only the sound of these descriptive nouns is retained ("which maketh himself a prophet"). It was the making prophecy a reality which disturbed the men of routine, and Shemaiah well knew this when he made this appeal to Zephaniah. There was no harm in being nominally a "prophet," but to "make," or rather, "show one's self as a prophet," to be an energetic prophet, a prophetizer (if the word may be invented), - this was wormwood to those who cried, "Peace, peace," when there was no peace. <span class="cmt_word">In prison, and in the stocks</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the stocks</span> (see on Jeremiah 20:2) <span class="accented">and in the collar</span>. The meaning seems to be that Jeremiah was subjected to both forms of punishment at once. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has appointed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1504;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
