In the biblical context, weeping often signifies genuine contrition and a turning away from sin (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>). Historically, the Israelites experienced exile and suffering due to their disobedience, and their return is marked by a heartfelt acknowledgment of their past transgressions. This weeping is not just an expression of sorrow but also a sign of hope and restoration, as God promises to bring them back.<p><b>and by their supplication I will lead them</b><br>Supplication indicates earnest prayer and petition. The Israelites' return is not just physical but spiritual, as they seek God's guidance and mercy. This aligns with the biblical theme of God responding to the prayers of His people (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The leadership of God in response to supplication underscores His role as a shepherd, guiding His flock back to safety and prosperity.<p><b>I will make them walk beside streams of waters</b><br>Streams of waters symbolize refreshment, life, and abundance. In the arid climate of the Near East, water is a precious resource, and its presence signifies God's provision and care (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>). This imagery also connects to the spiritual nourishment that God provides, as seen in Jesus' offer of living water in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>. The promise of walking beside streams indicates a future of peace and divine blessing.<p><b>on a level path where they will not stumble</b><br>A level path represents safety, stability, and ease of travel. In ancient times, uneven and rocky paths were dangerous, symbolizing life's challenges and obstacles. God's promise to make the path level signifies His protection and the removal of hindrances (<a href="/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>). This assurance of not stumbling reflects God's faithfulness in guiding His people securely, akin to the guidance offered by Jesus as the way (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>For I am Israel&#8217;s Father</b><br>This declaration emphasizes the intimate relationship between God and Israel. The fatherhood of God denotes care, authority, and a covenantal bond (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>). It highlights God's role as a protector and provider, reinforcing the idea of Israel as His chosen people. This paternal imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called children of God (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-16</a>).<p><b>and Ephraim is My firstborn.</b><br>Ephraim, representing the Northern Kingdom of Israel, is called the firstborn, a title of honor and preeminence (<a href="/genesis/48-13.htm">Genesis 48:13-20</a>). This designation signifies God's special favor and the restoration of a broken relationship. Despite Ephraim's past rebellion, God reaffirms His commitment to them. The concept of the firstborn also foreshadows Christ, the firstborn over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), who embodies the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often representing the collective people of God in the Old Testament.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, often used to represent the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/streams_of_waters.htm">Streams of Waters</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's provision and guidance, representing spiritual refreshment and sustenance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/level_path.htm">Level Path</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's guidance and protection, ensuring a safe journey for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassionate_guidance.htm">God's Compassionate Guidance</a></b><br>God leads His people with compassion, even when they come with weeping and supplications.

(Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/35-7.htm" title="And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.">Isaiah 35:7-8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm" title="Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.">Isaiah 43:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-21.htm" title="And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.">Isaiah 48:21</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/49-10.htm" title="They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.">Isaiah 49:10-11</a>, for like promises.)<p><span class= "bld">Ephraim is my firstborn.</span>--Ephraim stands here, as often elsewhere (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/hosea/11-3.htm" title="I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.">Hosea 11:3</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-12.htm" title="Ephraim compasses me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet rules with God, and is faithful with the saints.">Hosea 11:12</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-1.htm" title="When Ephraim spoke trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.">Hosea 13:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-12.htm" title="The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.">Hosea 13:12</a>) for the whole northern kingdom of the Ten Tribes, of which it was the most conspicuous member. The term "firstborn" is used, as an echo of <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22</a>, as marking out Ephraim as the object of the special favour of Jehovah, the birthright of Reuben having been transferred to the sons of Joseph (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm" title="Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but for as much as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.">1Chronicles 5:1</a>). The prominence of Ephraim over the other tribes is conspicuous throughout the whole history (<a href="/context/judges/12-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.">Judges 12:1-3</a>). The prophet apparently recognised it as taking its place once more in the restored unity of the people, when the king should be of the house of David, Jerusalem the centre of worship, Ephraim the leading tribe. (Comp. the contemporary prophecy of <a href="/ezekiel/37-19.htm" title="Say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.">Ezekiel 37:19</a>.) It is not without interest to note how the northern prophet looks to Judah as more faithful than Ephraim (<a href="/hosea/11-12.htm" title="Ephraim compasses me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet rules with God, and is faithful with the saints.">Hosea 11:12</a>), while Jeremiah turns from the sins of the princes and priests of Judah to look with hope on the remnant of Israel. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With weeping;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a joy dashed with sorrow at the thought of the sin which has rendered such an interposition necessary (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/31-18.htm">Jeremiah 31:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Cause them to walk by the rivers of waters.</span> The reference here is primarily to the homeward journey of the exiles, which shall be free from the trials of the first Exodus, but not exclusively (see on next verse). The question arises how this prediction is to be reconciled with facts. For, as Kimchi has remarked, we find no reference to miracles performed for the Jews who returned from Babylon. A twofold reply seems admissible. We may say either that to those who enjoy a vivid sense of the favour and protection of God no trial is grievous, no circumstances exclude an undercurrent of joy (comp. <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>.); or that the prophecy is still waiting for its complete fulfilment, Israel having still a great future reserved for it upon its recognition of the true Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">In a straight way;</span> or, <span class="accented">in an even way, i.e.</span> one free from hindrances. Comp. Ezra's prayer (<a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>), and <a href="/psalms/107-7.htm">Psalm 107:7</a>, in both of which passages "right" should probably be "even." Ephraim is my firstborn. It is doubted whether this simply means that Ephraim (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> North Israel) shall be in no respect inferior to Judah - a strong form of expression being chosen, on account of the longer continuance of Ephraim's captivity; or whether it implies a restoration to the tribes of Joseph of the prerogative conferred upon the sons of Joseph (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1, 2</a>; comp. <a href="/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>). The former view seems hardly consistent with the dignity of a prophetic writer. "Forms of expression," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rhetorical phrases, may be admitted in poetical passages, but hardly in solemn prophetic revelations. It was true that Judah had "prevailed above his brethren;" but the original "gift of God" to Ephraim was "without repentance." With regard to the fulfilment of this prediction, we must remember that the remnant of the northern tribes whose faith was strong enough to induce them to profit by the edict of Cyrus, was smaller than that of the southern. Hence the outward signs of God's favour to Ephraim could not be so great as they would have been had the moral conditions of the fulfilment of the promise been more fully complied with. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They will come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with weeping,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7687;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
