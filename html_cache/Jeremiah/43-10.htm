The title "LORD of Hosts" signifies God's command over the armies of heaven and earth, underscoring His power and control over all nations. The phrase "the God of Israel" reaffirms His covenant relationship with Israel, reminding the people of their unique identity and responsibilities. This introduction sets the stage for a divine pronouncement, indicating that the message is not from Jeremiah himself but from God, lending it ultimate authority.<p><b>&#8216;I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,</b><br>Referring to Nebuchadnezzar as "My servant" highlights God's sovereignty in using even pagan rulers to accomplish His purposes. This is consistent with other instances in Scripture where God uses foreign kings to fulfill His plans (e.g., Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>). Nebuchadnezzar, though a powerful and feared monarch, is depicted as an instrument in God's hand, demonstrating that all earthly power is subordinate to divine will. Historically, Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon from 605 to 562 BC, known for his military conquests and the expansion of the Babylonian Empire.<p><b>and I will set his throne over these stones that I have embedded,</b><br>The "stones" refer to those Jeremiah had hidden in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9</a>). This act was a prophetic symbol of Babylon's future dominance over Egypt. The setting of Nebuchadnezzar's throne over these stones signifies the transfer of power and authority, indicating that Babylon would conquer Egypt and establish control. This prophecy underscores the futility of seeking refuge in Egypt, as the very place the remnant of Judah fled to for safety would fall under Babylonian rule.<p><b>and he will spread his royal pavilion over them.</b><br>The "royal pavilion" symbolizes the establishment of Nebuchadnezzar's authority and presence. In ancient times, a king's pavilion was a tent or temporary structure used during military campaigns, signifying the king's command and governance. This imagery conveys the complete subjugation of Egypt under Babylonian control. The fulfillment of this prophecy is a testament to God's omniscience and the certainty of His word, serving as a warning to those who doubted Jeremiah's message and a reminder of God's ultimate plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel.

The English Version, as before, follows Luther in taking it for the awning or canopy which was stretched over the throne when the king sat in state as judge. Others (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Hitzig) find in it the leather covering which was placed over the pavement on which the throne was set, upon which the criminal knelt as on a scaffold to receive the death-stroke of the executioner. So taken, the prediction assumes a more definite and terrible aspect. The king was to sit upon the stones which Jeremiah had hidden, not merely in his regal pomp, but in the character of an avenger executing the wrath of Jehovah against the rebellious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And will set his throne,</span> etc.;
