Moab, Ammon, and Edom were neighboring regions east and southeast of Judah, often in conflict with Israel. The presence of Jews in these lands indicates the extent of the exile and the survival of Jewish communities outside their homeland. Historically, these regions had complex relationships with Israel, sometimes allies, often adversaries. The mention of "all the other lands" suggests a widespread diaspora, reflecting the fulfillment of prophecies about the scattering of Israel due to disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>).<p><b>that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah</b><br>The "remnant" refers to the small group of Jews who were not taken into exile but remained in the land of Judah. This concept of a remnant is significant throughout the Bible, symbolizing hope and the continuation of God's covenant with His people despite judgment. Theologically, the remnant represents God's mercy and faithfulness, ensuring that His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would endure. The king of Babylon's decision to leave a remnant aligns with God's sovereign plan, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>, where a remnant is prophesied to return to the mighty God.<p><b>and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over them</b><br>Gedaliah's appointment as governor by the Babylonian king was a strategic move to maintain order in the region. Gedaliah, from a prominent family, was known for his loyalty to the Babylonian authorities and his efforts to stabilize Judah. His father, Ahikam, had protected the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), and his grandfather, Shaphan, was a scribe during King Josiah's reign, involved in the discovery of the Book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8-10</a>). This lineage suggests a family committed to reform and faithfulness to God. Gedaliah's leadership was intended to encourage the Jews to settle and cultivate the land, as advised by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>), and to prevent further rebellion against Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews_in_moab,_ammonites,_and_edom.htm">Jews in Moab, Ammonites, and Edom</a></b><br>These are the Jewish exiles who had fled to neighboring regions during the Babylonian conquest.

The verse teaches that no matter how wide the dispersion or how severe the discipline, God safeguards a remnant, raises faithful leaders, and keeps His covenant path intact.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11, 12) <span class= "bld">When all the Jews that were in Moab . . .</span>--It lay in the nature of things that many of the dwellers in Judaea fled before the march of the Chaldaean armies, and took refuge in the neighbouring regions. In <a href="/ruth/1-2.htm" title="And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.">Ruth 1:2</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/22-3.htm" title="And David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.">1Samuel 22:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/16-4.htm" title="Let my outcasts dwell with you, Moab; be you a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortionist is at an end, the spoiler ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.">Isaiah 16:4</a>, we find analogous instances of fugitives from Judah finding shelter in the Moabite country. These, on hearing of the generous policy adopted by Gedaliah, took courage and returned in time to profit by his permission to gather the produce which otherwise would have been left to perish on the soil.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Jews</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
