Jeremiah had been instructed by God to wear this yoke as a sign of the coming Babylonian captivity (<a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>). Hananiah's act was a direct challenge to Jeremiah's prophecy, symbolizing his claim that God would break the yoke of Babylon within two years (<a href="/jeremiah/28-2.htm">Jeremiah 28:2-4</a>). This event highlights the tension between true and false prophecy in Israel, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The yoke symbolizes submission and servitude, and its breaking was meant to convey a message of liberation, albeit falsely.<p><b>the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah</b><br>This phrase indicates divine communication, a common occurrence in the prophetic books where God directly speaks to His prophets. Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," often received messages from God that were difficult and unpopular, yet he remained faithful in delivering them. The phrase underscores the authority and authenticity of Jeremiah's message as opposed to Hananiah's false prophecy. In the broader biblical context, the "word of the LORD" is a powerful and creative force, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> and <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1</a>, where God's word brings about creation and revelation.

Hananiah&#8217;s act tried to cancel God&#8217;s message by dramatic symbolism&#8212;yet another reminder that theatrics never override divine decree (cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11-28</a>).<p>- God will soon replace the wooden yoke with &#8220;an iron yoke&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/28-13.htm">Jeremiah 28:13</a>), proving that human bravado only hardens the coming discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>off his neck</b><p>- Jeremiah&#8217;s humble willingness to wear the yoke sets him apart from the nation&#8217;s pride (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/13-15.htm">Jeremiah 13:15-17</a>).<p>- Removing it from the prophet&#8217;s own neck highlights personal insult, yet Jeremiah offers no retaliation&#8212;mirroring the meekness later perfectly modeled by Christ (cf. <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p>- The scene contrasts two yokes: Hananiah&#8217;s promised freedom versus God&#8217;s call to submissive discipline, much as Jesus contrasts the heavy yokes people invent with His own easy and light one (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD</b><p>- Whatever Hananiah has said, the decisive voice now speaks: &#8220;the word of the LORD.&#8221; Divine revelation is final, infallible, and self-authenticating (cf. <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p>- Every competing word must yield, for &#8220;the Scripture cannot be broken&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>).<p>- This moment reminds us that God&#8217;s word not only informs but actively intervenes in history (cf. <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to Jeremiah</b><p>- The same prophet whom the leaders scorn now receives fresh instruction, verifying his calling from chapter 1: &#8220;The word of the LORD came to me&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-10</a>).<p>- True authority lies not in popular approval but in ongoing communion with God (cf. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>).<p>- Jeremiah&#8217;s reception of the word also signals that God equips His faithful servants at the very point of opposition, sustaining them for the next act of obedience (cf. <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/28-12.htm">Jeremiah 28:12</a> captures the turning point where God answers a counterfeit message with His own unmistakable voice. Hananiah&#8217;s dramatic gesture and temporary applause cannot silence divine truth. The Lord moves quickly, reaffirms Jeremiah, and sets the stage for judgment that no broken yoke-bar can prevent. In every age, when false assurance collides with God&#8217;s revealed will, the word of the LORD still comes&#8212;authoritative, timely, and unfailing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Then the word of the Lord . . .</span>--The narrative suggests the thought of a time of silent suffering and of prayer, to which the "word of the Lord" came as an answer.
