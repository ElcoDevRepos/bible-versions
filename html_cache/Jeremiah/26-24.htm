His father, Shaphan, was a scribe who played a significant role in the religious reforms of Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3-14</a>). Ahikam's support for Jeremiah indicates a continuation of his family's commitment to the true worship of Yahweh. This support is crucial as it highlights the presence of a remnant faithful to God amidst widespread apostasy. Ahikam's protection of Jeremiah can be seen as a type of Christ, who also protects and intercedes for His people.<p><b>so he was not handed over to the people</b><br>The people, stirred by the priests and prophets, sought to put Jeremiah to death for his prophecies against Jerusalem and the Temple (<a href="/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8-11</a>). This reflects the common biblical theme of the prophet's rejection by his own people, similar to the experiences of other prophets like Elijah and even Jesus (<a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>). The people's desire to execute Jeremiah underscores the tension between true prophetic messages and popular opinion or religious establishment.<p><b>to be put to death</b><br>The threat of death for Jeremiah was real and imminent, reflecting the severe consequences faced by prophets who delivered unpopular messages. This mirrors the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who, like Jeremiah, spoke truth to power and was rejected by the religious leaders of His time. The protection of Jeremiah by Ahikam can be seen as a divine intervention, ensuring the continuation of God's message through His prophet. This incident also foreshadows the protection and deliverance that God provides to His faithful servants, even in the face of persecution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

God&#8217;s faithful servant looked doomed, yet the Lord stepped in, mirroring His promise in <a href="/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>, &#8220;They will fight against you but will not prevail against you.&#8221; Whenever Scripture uses &#8220;nevertheless&#8221; (e.g., <a href="/psalms/73-23.htm">Psalm 73:23</a>; <a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>), it signals divine intervention overturning human plotting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ahikam son of Shaphan</b><p>Ahikam was the son of Shaphan, King Josiah&#8217;s trusted scribe who helped rediscover the Book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8&#8211;13</a>). This godly lineage mattered. Like his father, Ahikam feared the Lord more than the crowd (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-20.htm">2 Chronicles 34:20</a>). Later, his own son Gedaliah would shelter Jeremiah after Jerusalem fell (<a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14&#8211;40</a>:6).

Support here is more than sympathy; it is active protection (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9&#8211;10</a>). Ahikam used his influence in the royal court to shield the man of God, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8</a>, &#8220;Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so he was not handed over</b><p>The mob could not lay a finger on Jeremiah because the Lord raised up a defender (<a href="/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a>; <a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12&#8211;24</a>). God often works through human agents to restrain evil, just as He did when the Roman commander rescued Paul from the crowd (<a href="/acts/21-31.htm">Acts 21:31&#8211;32</a>). Here, civil authority unexpectedly serves God&#8217;s purpose, illustrating <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1&#8211;4</a> in action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the people</b><p>&#8220;The people&#8221; had been stirred into lethal fury by false religious leaders (<a href="/jeremiah/26-11.htm">Jeremiah 26:11</a>), echoing Jesus&#8217; warning in <a href="/matthew/24-9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a> that His followers would be hated &#8220;by all nations.&#8221; Scripture consistently distinguishes between popular opinion and divine truth (<a href="/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12&#8211;13</a>).

In this moment God spared Jeremiah, preserving him to deliver further messages (<a href="/bsb/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27&#8211;52</a>). His rescue points forward to Christ&#8217;s ultimate deliverance from death itself (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a> showcases God&#8217;s sovereign protection of His messenger through the courageous intervention of a single righteous official. While crowds raged and authorities wavered, Ahikam&#8217;s quiet support fulfilled God&#8217;s promise that His word&#8212;and His servant&#8212;would not be silenced. The verse reminds us that even in hostile times, the Lord can raise up unexpected allies, uphold His faithful witnesses, and turn imminent death into continued ministry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam . . .</span>--The family to whom the prophet's protector belonged played a conspicuous part in the history of this period, and may be said to have furnished examples of three generations of Jewish patriotism. Shaphan, the father, was prominent as a scribe in the reformation of Josiah (cir. A.D. 624). He superintended the restoration of the Temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-8.htm" title="Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.">2Chronicles 34:8</a>). To him Hilkiah the priest gave the book of the Law which had been found in the house of the Lord, and Shaphan took it to the king. He took his son Ahikam with him when he was sent to consult the prophetess Huldah (<a href="/2_kings/22-12.htm" title="And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,">2Kings 22:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/34-20.htm" title="And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,">2Chronicles 34:20</a>). Here the son meets us, true to the early lessons of his life, as the protector of the prophet, whose work rested so largely on the impression made by the Book of the Law thus discovered. A brother of Ahikam, Gemariah, appears in a like character in <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm" title="Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, see, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.">Jeremiah 36:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a>. After the conquest of the land by Nebuchadnezzar, Jeremiah finds refuge with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam (<a href="/jeremiah/40-6.htm" title="Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelled with him among the people that were left in the land.">Jeremiah 40:6</a>), who had been made, apparently through the prophet's influence, satrap, or governor, of the lands under the Chaldaean king; and he, after a fruitless warning, falls a victim to the conspiracy of the princes of the royal house (<a href="/context/jeremiah/41-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.">Jeremiah 41:1-2</a>). Here stress is laid on the fact of Ahikam's protection, as showing how it was that Jeremiah escaped the fate which fell on Urijah. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless</span> the hand of Ahi-kant, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in spite of the prepossession against prophets like Jeremiah which this incident reveals, Ahikam threw all his influence into the scale of toleration.'
