Their way of life was a deliberate choice to avoid the settled lifestyle of the Canaanites, which often led to idolatry and moral decay. The Rechabites' commitment to not building houses symbolizes a rejection of the materialism and permanence associated with urban life, emphasizing a reliance on God rather than on human structures.<p><b>or sow seed</b><br>The prohibition against sowing seed indicates a rejection of agricultural practices that would tie them to a specific land. This lifestyle choice aligns with the nomadic traditions of the patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who also lived as sojourners in the land. It reflects a trust in God's provision rather than in human efforts to cultivate and control the land.<p><b>or plant a vineyard</b><br>Vineyards in ancient Israel were symbols of wealth and stability, often associated with the blessings of the Promised Land. By abstaining from planting vineyards, the Rechabites distanced themselves from the potential for excess and the temptations that come with prosperity. This choice echoes the Nazarite vow, which also included abstaining from wine, symbolizing a life set apart for God.<p><b>Those things are not for you</b><br>This phrase underscores the distinct identity and calling of the Rechabites. Their lifestyle was a counter-cultural witness to the Israelites, who were often tempted by the practices of surrounding nations. It serves as a reminder of the call to holiness and separation from worldly influences, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>Instead, you must live in tents all your lives</b><br>Living in tents signifies a transient lifestyle, reminiscent of Israel's wilderness wanderings. It highlights a dependence on God for guidance and provision, as well as a readiness to move at His command. This way of life is a physical manifestation of spiritual truths, emphasizing the temporary nature of earthly life and the eternal perspective believers are called to maintain.<p><b>so that you may live a long time in the land where you wander.</b><br>This promise of longevity in the land is conditional upon obedience to the commands given. It reflects the covenantal blessings associated with faithfulness to God's instructions. The Rechabites' adherence to their ancestor's commands serves as a model of obedience and faith, contrasting with the disobedience of Judah, which ultimately led to exile. This phrase also echoes the blessings promised in the Mosaic Covenant for those who follow God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rechabites.htm">Rechabites</a></b><br>A nomadic group descended from Rechab, known for their obedience to their ancestor Jonadab's command to live a simple, nomadic lifestyle without permanent dwellings or agriculture.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonadab_son_of_rechab.htm">Jonadab son of Rechab</a></b><br>An ancestor of the Rechabites who commanded his descendants to abstain from wine and live a nomadic lifestyle, emphasizing obedience and separation from the practices of surrounding nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who uses the Rechabites' obedience as an object lesson for the people of Judah, highlighting their faithfulness in contrast to Judah's disobedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was often disobedient to God's commands, leading to prophetic warnings and eventual exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jeremiah brought the Rechabites to test their obedience, serving as a backdrop for the lesson on faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_godly_heritage.htm">Obedience to Godly Heritage</a></b><br>The Rechabites' adherence to Jonadab's command demonstrates the importance of honoring and maintaining a godly heritage.

In Scripture, a house often represents security and rootedness (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12&#8211;14</a>), but God used this family&#8217;s homelessness to make a point: obedience matters more than comfort. Abraham &#8220;lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9</a>), signaling a pilgrim mindset that trusted God rather than brick and mortar. The Rechabites&#8217; refusal to build underscored that same dependence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or sow seed</b><p>Plowing a field ties you to one piece of earth for seasons on end. By skipping agriculture the Rechabites avoided entanglement in the economic patterns and worldly priorities that had corrupted Judah (<a href="/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12&#8211;13</a>). Jesus later reminded His followers that &#8220;life is more than food&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-23.htm">Luke 12:23</a>), echoing this lesson: God, not harvest cycles, is the ultimate Provider.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or plant a vineyard</b><p>A vineyard promised both profit and the wine their ancestor had vowed to avoid (<a href="/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6</a>). Steering clear of vineyards showed total commitment to that vow, much like the Nazirites who abstained from grape products (<a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>). <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> warns, &#8220;Wine is a mocker,&#8221; and the Rechabites&#8217; lifestyle became a living sermon against an indulgence that had trapped many in Judah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those things are not for you</b><p>These words draw a clear boundary line. Holiness always involves saying no to certain liberties others feel free to enjoy (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>). By accepting what was &#8220;not for them,&#8221; the Rechabites embodied <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>&#8212;non-conformity that proves the good and pleasing will of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Instead, you must live in tents all your lives</b><p>Tents kept them mobile and minimally attached to the land, mirroring Israel&#8217;s wilderness years when God was their only stability (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>). Living light kept their hearts light, too. <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a> speaks of saints who &#8220;acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth,&#8221; and <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a> urges believers to adopt that same identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you may live a long time in the land where you wander</b><p>God ties longevity to obedience in many places (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2-3</a>). The Rechabites&#8217; unusual lifestyle wasn&#8217;t punishment; it was protection. By staying separate from Judah&#8217;s corrupt practices they avoided the judgment soon to fall on the land (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-11</a>). Their faithfulness was rewarded when God promised, &#8220;Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man to stand before Me&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/35-19.htm">Jeremiah 35:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/35-7.htm">Jeremiah 35:7</a> is God&#8217;s spotlight on a family whose simple, counter-cultural obedience shamed Judah&#8217;s stubborn rebellion. Refusing houses, farms, and vineyards, the Rechabites modeled trust, holiness, and pilgrim dependence. Their tents preached that lasting security comes not from possessions but from walking in God&#8217;s commands&#8212;and that kind of faith still brings His favor today.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/35-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nor are you ever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to build</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;i&#7687;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1129.htm">Strong's 1129: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;a&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
