The cistern, a large pit or reservoir used for storing water, becomes a mass grave, symbolizing the depth of treachery and violence. The murder of Gedaliah, a significant leader, marks a pivotal moment in Judah's history, leading to further chaos and despair among the remnant left in the land after the Babylonian exile. This act of violence is a stark reminder of the political instability and the consequences of rebellion against God's appointed leaders.<p><b>was a large one that King Asa had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel</b><br>King Asa of Judah constructed this cistern during his reign as a defensive measure against Baasha, the king of Israel. This historical context underscores the longstanding conflict between the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. Asa's efforts to fortify his kingdom reflect the constant threat of invasion and the need for strategic defense. The cistern, originally intended for protection, ironically becomes a site of internal betrayal and murder, illustrating how tools meant for preservation can be repurposed for destruction when God's people turn away from His guidance.<p><b>Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain</b><br>Ishmael's actions in filling the cistern with the bodies of the slain demonstrate the extent of his rebellion and disregard for human life. This act of filling the cistern with corpses is not only a physical act of violence but also a symbolic gesture of defilement and desecration. It reflects the moral and spiritual decay present in Judah at the time. Theologically, this can be seen as a consequence of the people's disobedience to God, leading to judgment and further suffering.

The verse opens by pointing to such a real, physical structure, reminding us that the narrative is rooted in literal history, not legend. The same kind of pit had earlier been used to imprison Jeremiah himself (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>), so readers are already familiar with its size and depth. Here it becomes the silent witness to a fresh atrocity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies</b><p>Ishmael&#8217;s first instinct after the slaughter is concealment. Just as Joab hid Abner&#8217;s corpse to try to cover his treachery (<a href="/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26-27</a>), Ishmael disposes of the dead in an attempt to erase evidence. <a href="/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17</a> warns, &#8220;A man burdened by bloodguilt will flee into the pit; let no one support him.&#8221; The cistern testifies that sin always seeks darkness, but the very mention of it in Scripture shows that God brings hidden things to light (<a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the men he had struck down along with Gedaliah</b><p>These men were part of the small remnant left in Judah after the Babylonian conquest. Gedaliah, appointed governor by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5-6</a>), had urged his countrymen to &#8220;serve the Chaldeans, and it will go well with you&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/25-24.htm">2 Kings 25:24</a>). Ishmael&#8217;s murder of them was not only political rebellion; it was defiance of the prophetic word that submission to Babylon was God's discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12-13</a>). Their bodies, lying beside Gedaliah&#8217;s, underscore the high cost of rejecting God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was a large one that King Asa had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel</b><p>Centuries earlier, Asa of Judah fortified Mizpah against Baasha of the northern kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/15-16.htm">1 Kings 15:16-22</a>). The massive pit, once part of national defense, now serves a ghastly purpose.

It recalls Jehu&#8217;s zeal that &#8220;filled&#8221; the field of Naboth with blood (<a href="/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>), yet Ishmael&#8217;s motive is not zeal for God but pursuit of self-interest, possibly at the behest of Ammon (<a href="/jeremiah/40-14.htm">Jeremiah 40:14</a>). <a href="/psalms/5-6.htm">Psalm 5:6</a> declares, &#8220;The LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.&#8221; By literally filling the cistern, Ishmael figuratively fills up the measure of Judah&#8217;s iniquity, setting the stage for further judgment and the remnant&#8217;s flight to Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/42-14.htm">Jeremiah 42:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/41-9.htm">Jeremiah 41:9</a> records a literal event that stands as a vivid object lesson: hidden sin will be exposed, rebellion against God-ordained authority brings devastation, and structures meant for protection become monuments of judgment when a people turn from the Lord. The cistern&#8217;s transformation from life-giving reservoir to burial pit warns every generation that &#8220;the wages of sin is death&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>), while also affirming the reliability of Scripture&#8217;s historical detail and moral clarity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Because of Gedaliah.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">by the hand of Gedaliah; i.e., </span>by using his name to entrap the unsuspecting pilgrims.<p><span class= "bld">Which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha . . .</span>--See <a href="/1_kings/15-22.htm" title="Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.">1Kings 15:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-6.htm" title="Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.">2Chronicles 16:6</a>.

The "pit" was probably a trench with a drawbridge over it, so constructed as to stop all approach from the neighbouring kingdom; or else one of the tanks or reservoirs constructed to supply the fortress with water. A various reading gives "the pit of Gedaliah," instead of "because of Gedaliah."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the pit... which Arm the king had made,</span> etc. Nothing is said of this "pit" in the historical books, but only (<a href="/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a> = <a href="/2_chronicles/16-6.htm">2 Chronicles 16:6</a>) that Asa used the material with which Baasha had fortified Ramah to build Geba and Mizpah. It would seem that this "pit" formed part of Asa's defensive works; probably it was a cistern to supply the town with water during the siege. <span class="cmt_word">Because of Gedaliah;</span> was it. The rendering "because of" must be abandoned. The Septuagint has, in this part of the verse, the very natural words, "was a great pit," and this reading is adopted by Movers, Hitzig, and Graft. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/41-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the cistern</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hab&#183;b&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124; Noun -
