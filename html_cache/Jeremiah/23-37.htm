In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23</a>, God is addressing the false prophets who were misleading the people of Judah. The historical context is the period leading up to the Babylonian exile, a time when many false prophets were claiming to speak for God, offering false hope and assurances of peace. This directive serves as a corrective measure, emphasizing the need for discernment and accountability among those claiming to speak on behalf of the Lord.<p><b>&#8216;What has the LORD answered you?&#8217;</b><br>This question underscores the importance of verifying the authenticity of a prophet's message. In the biblical context, a true prophet's words would align with God's will and previous revelations. The question implies a need for confirmation and consistency with God's established word. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>, where the test of a true prophet is whether their predictions come to pass. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of testing the spirits (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>) to ensure they are from God.<p><b>and &#8216;What has the LORD spoken?&#8217;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the necessity of direct revelation from God rather than human invention. It calls for clarity and truthfulness in prophetic messages. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on the spoken word, especially when attributed to divine origin. This demand for authenticity is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus, the ultimate prophet, speaks only what He hears from the Father (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>). The phrase also serves as a reminder of the prophetic office's responsibility to convey God's true message, foreshadowing the perfect fulfillment of prophecy in Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals in Jeremiah's time who claimed to speak for God but delivered messages that contradicted God's true word.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing impending judgment due to its disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's prophecies, often caught between listening to true and false messages.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_prophecy.htm">Discernment in Prophecy</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment when evaluating messages claimed to be from God.

Compare <a href="/jeremiah/23-35.htm">Jeremiah 23:35</a>, where the same prophets are trading private opinions instead of reporting God&#8217;s verdict.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the Lord said, &#8220;I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-21.htm">Jeremiah 23:21</a>). His instruction in verse 37 exposes that independence.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithful servants have always asked for the real, verifiable word of the Lord&#8212;see <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>, where a prophet&#8217;s credibility stands or falls on whether the Lord actually spoke.<p>&#8226; In the New Covenant the call is echoed: &#8220;Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>). The principle remains unchanged&#8212;God&#8217;s answer is authoritative and must be tested against His revealed truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and &#8216;What has the LORD spoken?&#8217;</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and &#8216;What has the LORD spoken?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-37.htm">Jeremiah 23:37</a>)<p>&#8226; The second demand reaches deeper: not merely &#8220;What answer did He give?&#8221; but &#8220;What exact words has He spoken?&#8221; Precision matters because every word of God is pure (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>).<p>&#8226; True prophets are mouthpieces, not editors; Balaam admitted, &#8220;Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-38.htm">Numbers 22:38</a>).<p>&#8226; God condemns those who fabricate messages: &#8220;Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/13-3.htm">Ezekiel 13:3</a>). <a href="/jeremiah/23-37.htm">Jeremiah 23:37</a> forces them to lay bare whether they possess an authentic utterance or empty rhetoric.<p>&#8226; The New Testament upholds the same standard: &#8220;No prophecy of Scripture comes from one&#8217;s own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever brought by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore calls for absolute fidelity to God&#8217;s spoken revelation, guarding the flock from deception and preserving the integrity of divine truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/23-37.htm">Jeremiah 23:37</a> equips God&#8217;s people with a two-part safeguard: demand to know both the Lord&#8217;s settled answer and His exact spoken words. In an age crowded with self-appointed messengers, the verse insists on verifiable, word-for-word fidelity to divine revelation. Tested against prior Scripture and consistent with God&#8217;s character, the genuine message stands; everything else is exposed as counterfeit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">Thus shalt thou say to the prophet . . .</span>--The verse repeats <a href="/jeremiah/23-35.htm" title="Thus shall you say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What has the LORD answered? and, What has the LORD spoken?">Jeremiah 23:35</a>, with the one difference that men are to use this, the simpler form of language, when they come to the prophet, as well as when they are speaking one to another.
