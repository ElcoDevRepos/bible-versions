The term "hardened" suggests a deliberate and persistent resistance to God's commands, reminiscent of Pharaoh's hardened heart in Exodus. This rebellion is not just individual but communal, reflecting a society that has turned away from God. The historical context is the period leading up to the Babylonian exile, where the people repeatedly ignored prophetic warnings. This rebellion is a fulfillment of the warnings given in Deuteronomy about the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>walking around as slanderers</b><br>The imagery of "walking around" suggests a habitual lifestyle, indicating that slander and deceit are pervasive in society. Slander, or false accusation, is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in Proverbs and James, highlighting the destructive power of the tongue. This behavior reflects a breakdown in community trust and justice, which are central to the covenant relationship with God. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on community integrity, making slander a serious offense.<p><b>They are bronze and iron</b><br>Bronze and iron are metals that, while strong, are not as valuable as gold or silver. This metaphor suggests that the people have become spiritually and morally inferior, lacking the purity and worth that God desires. In biblical symbolism, metals often represent different qualities or states of being. The use of bronze and iron here may also imply a stubbornness and resistance to refinement, as these metals are harder to purify. This connects to the prophetic imagery of refining and testing found in other parts of Jeremiah and the prophets.<p><b>all of them are corrupt</b><br>The term "corrupt" indicates a deep-seated moral decay, suggesting that the people's actions and hearts are tainted. This corruption is comprehensive, affecting every aspect of life and society. The biblical narrative often contrasts corruption with holiness, calling God's people to be set apart. This phrase echoes the broader biblical theme of human sinfulness and the need for divine intervention, pointing forward to the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who offers purification and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
