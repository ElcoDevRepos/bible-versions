The "hill country" often denotes the central mountainous region, which includes areas like Hebron and Jerusalem. The "foothills" or "Shephelah" is the lowland region between the hill country and the coastal plain, known for its fertile land. The "Negev" is the arid southern region, significant for its role in the journeys of the patriarchs. These areas were historically significant for Israel's agricultural and pastoral life, and their mention here underscores the comprehensive nature of God's promise to restore prosperity and normalcy to the land.<p><b>in the land of Benjamin and the cities surrounding Jerusalem</b><br>The land of Benjamin was located north of Jerusalem and was one of the twelve tribes of Israel. This area held strategic importance due to its proximity to Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel. The cities surrounding Jerusalem would include places like Bethany and Bethlehem, which are significant in biblical history. This phrase highlights the restoration of these areas, which had suffered during the Babylonian conquest, emphasizing God's promise of renewal and peace.<p><b>and in the cities of Judah</b><br>Judah was the southern kingdom, and its cities were central to the identity and history of the Jewish people. This region included Jerusalem, the capital, and was the heart of Jewish worship and governance. The mention of Judah signifies the restoration of the kingdom's heartland, which had been devastated by exile and destruction. This restoration is a fulfillment of God's covenant promises to His people.<p><b>the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them</b><br>This imagery of flocks passing under the shepherd's hand is a pastoral metaphor indicating care, oversight, and prosperity. In ancient times, shepherds would count their sheep as they passed under their staff, ensuring none were lost. This symbolizes God's attentive care and the return of normal agricultural life, a sign of peace and stability. It also alludes to the role of God as the ultimate Shepherd, a theme echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, where Jesus is depicted as the Good Shepherd.<p><b>says the LORD</b><br>This phrase affirms the divine authority behind the promise. It underscores that the restoration and blessings are not merely hopeful wishes but are decreed by God Himself. This assurance is crucial for the exiled Israelites, reinforcing their hope and trust in God's faithfulness to His covenant. The prophetic declaration "says the LORD" is a common biblical formula that authenticates the message as coming directly from God, ensuring its certainty and reliability.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction and eventual restoration of Jerusalem and Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hill_country,_foothills,_and_negev.htm">Hill Country, Foothills, and Negev</a></b><br>These are geographical regions in ancient Israel, representing diverse landscapes and communities within the land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_benjamin.htm">Land of Benjamin</a></b><br>A tribal territory in Israel, significant for its proximity to Jerusalem and its historical importance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of worship and governance for the Israelites, often symbolic of God's presence and the heart of the nation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_judah.htm">Cities of Judah</a></b><br>Refers to the towns and cities within the territory of the tribe of Judah, representing the southern kingdom of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_hope.htm">Restoration and Hope</a></b><br>God's promise of restoration is a central theme.
