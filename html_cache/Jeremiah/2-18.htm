Historically, Egypt was a significant power, and Israel frequently turned to it for military support against other threats, such as the Assyrians and Babylonians. This reliance on Egypt is seen as a lack of trust in God, who had delivered Israel from Egyptian bondage in the past (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). The rhetorical question implies that seeking help from Egypt will not bring the desired security or prosperity.<p><b>to drink the waters of the Nile?</b><br>The Nile River was the lifeblood of Egypt, representing its strength and sustenance. Drinking its waters symbolizes reliance on Egypt's resources and power. In a spiritual sense, this act signifies turning away from the living water that God provides (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>) and instead seeking satisfaction in earthly sources that ultimately cannot fulfill. This imagery contrasts with the living water Jesus offers in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>, highlighting the inadequacy of worldly solutions compared to divine provision.<p><b>What will you gain on your way to Assyria</b><br>Assyria was another dominant empire during Jeremiah's time, known for its military might and oppressive rule. Israel's inclination to seek Assyrian support reflects a pattern of political maneuvering rather than trusting in God's protection. Historically, Assyria had already been a threat to Israel, having conquered the northern kingdom in 722 BC. The question underscores the futility and danger of relying on a nation that had previously been an adversary.<p><b>to drink the waters of the Euphrates?</b><br>The Euphrates River was central to Assyria's power and prosperity, much like the Nile was to Egypt. Drinking its waters symbolizes dependence on Assyria's strength and resources. This reliance is portrayed as misguided, as it involves turning away from God's covenant and protection. The imagery of water here also serves as a metaphor for seeking life and sustenance from sources other than God, echoing the broader biblical theme of God as the true source of life and blessing (<a href="/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The "river," or "flood," needing no other name as pre-eminent in its greatness (comp. <a href="/context/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14-15</a>), the Euphrates, stood for Assyria (comp. <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7</a>). The words point to the tendency to court the alliance now of one, now of the other of the great kingdoms of the world. The policy was no new one. Menahem in Israel, Ahaz in Judah, had courted Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/16-7.htm" title="So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.">2Kings 16:7-8</a>); Hezekiah, Babylon (Isaiah 39); Hoshea had sought help from Egypt (<a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2Kings 17:4</a>). The prophet Hosea had rebuked both policies (<a href="/hosea/5-13.htm" title="When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.">Hosea 5:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-11.htm" title="Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-9.htm" title="For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim has hired lovers.">Hosea 8:9</a>). Even under Hezekiah there was a party seeking the Egyptian alliance (Isaiah 18, 19, 31. Under Manasseh and Amon that party was in power, and the very name of the latter probably bears witness to its influence. Josiah kept as far as possible the position of a neutral, but, when forced into action, and probably guided by the counsels of Hilkiah, resisted the advance of Pharaoh-nechoh (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>). On his death the Egyptian party again gained ground under Jehoiakim, while Jeremiah, opposing its strength, urged the wisdom of accepting the guidance of events, and submitting to the Chaldaeans (so far continuing the line of action adopted by Hezekiah), and ultimately was accused of deserting his own people and "falling away" to their oppressors (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm" title="And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What hast thou to do in the way of Egypt?</span> rather, <span class="accented">with the way to Egypt</span>.
