It suggests that the behavior of the people is so blatant that it should be evident to anyone observing. This is a call to awareness and acknowledgment of the sinful practices taking place, highlighting the spiritual blindness or willful ignorance of the people.<p><b>what they are doing</b><br>The actions referred to here are the idolatrous practices and sinful behaviors of the people of Judah. This includes worshiping false gods, engaging in rituals that are abominable to the Lord, and turning away from the covenant relationship with God. The phrase underscores the seriousness of their actions, which are in direct violation of the commandments given to them.<p><b>in the cities of Judah</b><br>Judah was the southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The cities of Judah were centers of political, economic, and religious life. The mention of "cities" indicates that the idolatry and sin were widespread, not confined to rural areas or isolated incidents. This widespread corruption reflects a systemic failure in the society to uphold the laws and worship of Yahweh.<p><b>and in the streets of Jerusalem?</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital city, was the spiritual and political heart of Judah. The reference to the "streets" of Jerusalem suggests that the idolatrous practices were not hidden but were public and pervasive. Jerusalem was home to the Temple, the center of Jewish worship, making the presence of idolatry there particularly egregious. This highlights the depth of the people's rebellion against God, as they defiled the very city that was meant to be holy. The public nature of these actions indicates a societal acceptance of sin, contrasting sharply with the city's intended role as a beacon of God's presence and law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
