In the historical context, Israel relied on priests and prophets to mediate their understanding of God. This prophecy points to a new covenant where the law is written on hearts (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>), suggesting a personal and direct relationship with God. This anticipates the New Testament era, where the Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in teaching believers (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p><b>because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest,</b><br>The inclusivity of "from the least of them to the greatest" emphasizes that this knowledge of God will transcend social, economic, and cultural barriers. In ancient Israel, societal status often influenced one's access to religious instruction. This prophecy envisions a democratization of divine knowledge, fulfilled in the New Testament through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-18</a>), where all believers, regardless of status, receive the Spirit.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and certainty of the prophecy. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that authenticates the message as coming directly from God. It assures the audience of the reliability and divine origin of the promise, reflecting the covenantal faithfulness of God seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>For I will forgive their iniquities and will remember their sins no more.&#8221;</b><br>This promise of forgiveness is central to the new covenant, contrasting with the old covenant's sacrificial system, which provided only temporary atonement. The complete forgiveness and forgetfulness of sins point to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose death and resurrection provide eternal redemption (<a href="/hebrews/10-17.htm">Hebrews 10:17-18</a>). This phrase highlights the transformative power of God's grace, fulfilling prophecies of a Messiah who would bear the sins of many (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>) and establishing a new relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction and restoration of Jerusalem and Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises a new covenant with His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel_and_judah.htm">Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, to whom the promise of a new covenant is given.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_covenant.htm">The New Covenant</a></b><br>A future promise of a renewed relationship between God and His people, characterized by internal transformation and forgiveness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness_of_sins.htm">Forgiveness of Sins</a></b><br>A key aspect of the new covenant, where God promises to forgive and forget the sins of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_knowing_god.htm">The Universality of Knowing God</a></b><br>The promise that all will know the Lord signifies a personal and direct relationship with God, available to everyone, regardless of status or background.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_forgiveness_in_the_new_covenant.htm">The Role of Forgiveness in the New Covenant</a></b><br>God's forgiveness is complete and transformative, offering believers a fresh start and a clean slate, which is central to the new covenant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_internalization_of_god's_law.htm">The Internalization of God's Law</a></b><br>Unlike the old covenant, which was external and written on stone, the new covenant involves God's law being written on our hearts, leading to genuine obedience and transformation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_god's_promises.htm">The Assurance of God's Promises</a></b><br>The declaration that God will remember sins no more provides believers with assurance and peace, knowing that their past does not define their future in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_the_reality_of_the_new_covenant.htm">Living in the Reality of the New Covenant</a></b><br>Believers are called to live in the reality of the new covenant, embracing the personal relationship with God and the transformative power of His forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_31_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 31:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_31_34_God_s_and_our_forgiveness.htm">How does Jeremiah 31:34 emphasize God's forgiveness and our need to forgive others?

Here, the LORD promises a day when that model is transformed.<p>&#8226; The promise does not diminish the value of biblical teaching today (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>; <a href="/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a>).<p>&#8226; It anticipates a covenant in which every believer has direct, Spirit-enabled access to God (<a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The shift points forward to Pentecost, when the Spirit was poured out on all flesh, eliminating the old barriers of age, gender, and status (<a href="/acts/2-16.htm">Acts 2:16-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saying, &#8220;Know the LORD,&#8221;</b><p>Under the old covenant, calling someone to &#8220;know the LORD&#8221; meant urging him to enter covenant obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>).

What good had come of all the machinery of ritual and of teaching which the Law of Israel had provided so abundantly? Those repeated exhortations on the part of preachers and prophets that men should "know the Lord," what did they present but the dreary monotony as of an "old worm-eaten homily"? To know Him, as indeed He is, required nothing less than a special revelation of His presence to each man's heart and spirit, and that revelation was now, for his comfort, promised for all who were willing to receive it as the special gift of the near or distant future which opened to his view in his vision of a restored Israel. Here also the words of Jeremiah echo those of an older prophet (<a href="/isaiah/54-13.htm" title="And all your children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of your children.">Isaiah 54:13</a>), and find their fulfilment in those of Christ (<a href="/john/6-45.htm" title="It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to me.">John 6:45</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I will forgive their iniquity . . .</span>--The second clause repeats the promise of the first, in a form which is, perhaps, from the necessity of the case, after the manner of men. Our thoughts of God as the All knowing preclude the idea of any limitation of His knowledge, such as the words "I will remember no more" imply. What is meant is that He will be to him who repents and knows Him as indeed He is, in His essential righteousness and love, as men are <span class= "ital">to </span>men when they "forget and forgive." He will treat the past offences, even though their inevitable consequences may continue, as though they had never been, so far as they affect the communion of the soul with God. He will, in the language of another prophet, "blot out" the sins which yet belong to the indelible and irrevocable past (<a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm" title="I, even I, am he that blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember your sins.">Isaiah 43:25</a>;
