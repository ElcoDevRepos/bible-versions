In the ancient Near East, fishing was a common occupation, and fishermen were known for their patience and skill. Here, God is using this metaphor to describe how He will gather His people or execute judgment. The idea of God sending fishermen suggests a deliberate and methodical approach. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament when Jesus calls His disciples to be "fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>), indicating a gathering of people for God's kingdom. The declaration by the LORD emphasizes divine authority and intentionality in this action.<p><b>and they will catch them.</b><br>The phrase "and they will catch them" implies success and inevitability in the task assigned by God. In the context of Jeremiah, this likely refers to the impending judgment and exile of the people of Judah. The certainty of being "caught" underscores the inescapability of God's judgment. This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the final judgment, where all will be accountable before God. The act of catching suggests a thorough and complete gathering, leaving no one behind.<p><b>After that I will send for many hunters,</b><br>The transition from fishermen to hunters indicates a shift in method and intensity. Hunters, unlike fishermen, actively pursue their prey, often in more challenging terrains. This suggests a more aggressive and relentless pursuit. In the historical context, this could refer to the Babylonian forces that would invade and capture Judah. The use of hunters also implies that those who try to hide or escape will be sought out. This imagery is consistent with the theme of divine retribution found throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill,</b><br>Mountains and hills in biblical times were often places of refuge and worship, sometimes associated with idolatry (e.g., high places). The mention of these locations indicates that no place will be safe from God's judgment. The thoroughness of the hunt signifies that God's reach is all-encompassing, and His justice will be executed everywhere. This can be connected to the idea that God's presence and authority extend over all creation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges that there is no place to hide from God.<p><b>even from the clefts of the rocks.</b><br>Clefts of the rocks were natural hiding places, often used for protection and concealment. The reference to these locations highlights the futility of trying to escape God's judgment. It suggests that even the most secure and hidden places will not provide safety from divine retribution. This imagery is reminiscent of the end times described in <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>, where people seek to hide in caves and among the rocks from the wrath of the Lamb. It underscores the theme of God's omniscience and omnipotence, where nothing is hidden from His sight.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Jeremiah to convey His plans and purposes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fishermen_and_hunters.htm">Fishermen and Hunters</a></b><br>Metaphorical agents used by God to gather and pursue the people of Israel, symbolizing different methods of divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains,_hills,_and_clefts_of_the_rocks.htm">Mountains, Hills, and Clefts of the Rocks</a></b><br>Geographic features symbolizing places of refuge or hiding, indicating that no place is beyond God's reach.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of all events and uses various means to accomplish His purposes, whether through judgment or redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inescapability_of_god's_judgment.htm">Inescapability of God's Judgment</a></b><br>Just as fishermen and hunters are thorough in their pursuit, God's judgment is comprehensive and unavoidable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The imagery serves as a warning to turn back to God before judgment comes, highlighting the urgency of repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_relentless_pursuit.htm">God's Relentless Pursuit</a></b><br>While the context is judgment, the broader biblical account shows God's relentless pursuit of His people for redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_fishermen_and_hunters.htm">Symbolism of Fishermen and Hunters</a></b><br>These roles can also symbolize the church's mission to seek out and bring people to God, transforming judgment imagery into a call for evangelism.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_16_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 16:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_16_16_God_s_pursuit_of_strays.htm">How does Jeremiah 16:16 illustrate God's pursuit of those who stray from Him?

Yet the same sovereign God later sends other fishermen&#8212;Christ&#8217;s disciples&#8212;to gather souls for redemption. The verse therefore stands as both a sober warning of inescapable judgment for unrepentant sin and a backdrop that magnifies the grace offered through the greater Fisherman, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">I will send for many fishers . . .</span>--The words refer to the threat, not to the promise.

The process is described under this very name of "drag-netting" the country by Herodotus (iii. 149, 6:31), as applied by the army of Xerxes to Samos, Chios, Tenedos, and other islands. The application of the words either to the gathering of the people after their dispersion or to the later work of the preachers of the Gospel is an after-thought, having its source in our Lord's words, "I will make you fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm" title="And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.">Matthew 4:19</a>). It is, of course, possible enough that those words may have been suggested by Jeremiah's, the same image being used, as in the parable of <a href="/matthew/13-47.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:">Matthew 13:47</a>, to describe the blessing which had before presented its darker aspect of punishment.<p><span class= "bld">Hunters.</span>--Another aspect of the same thought, pointing, so far as we can trace the distinction between the two, to the work of the irregular skirmisher as the former image did to that of the main body of the army: men might take refuge, as hunted beasts might do, in the caves of the rocks, but they should be driven forth even from these.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will send for</span> should rather <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I will send</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Fishers and hunters</span>, by a divinely given impulse, shall "fish" and "hunt" the unhappy fugitives from their lurking-places. There may, perhaps, be an allusion to the cruel ancient practice of "sweeping the country with a drag-net" (Herod, 3:149), and then destroying the male population: Samos, e.g. was thus "netted" and depopulated by the Persians. Habakkuk may also refer to this when he says (Habakkuk 1:15), "They catch them in their net, and gather them in their <span class="accented">drag</span>." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But for now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
