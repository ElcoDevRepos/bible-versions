In the Old Testament, the land of Israel is often depicted as being directly affected by the people's faithfulness or unfaithfulness to God. The mourning of the land and withering of grass symbolize desolation and divine judgment. This imagery is reminiscent of the curses for disobedience outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>, where the heavens become like bronze and the earth like iron, indicating a lack of rain and fertility. The land's mourning is a metaphor for the consequences of sin, echoing the lamentations found in other prophetic books like <a href="/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>, where the land mourns due to the people's sins.<p><b>Because of the evil of its residents, the animals and birds have been swept away,</b><br>The phrase highlights the comprehensive impact of human sin on creation, a theme that resonates with the broader biblical narrative of the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where sin leads to a curse on the ground. The removal of animals and birds signifies ecological disaster, a direct result of the inhabitants' wickedness. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God, humanity, and creation, where human sin disrupts the intended harmony. The sweeping away of animals and birds can also be seen as a fulfillment of prophetic warnings, such as those in <a href="/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>, where God declares He will consume man and beast as a judgment against sin.<p><b>for the people have said, &#8220;He cannot see what our end will be.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals the people's skepticism and spiritual blindness, doubting God's omniscience and justice. It reflects a common biblical theme where people question God's awareness or concern, similar to the sentiments expressed in <a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>, where the wicked believe God does not see or judge their actions. This attitude of disbelief and arrogance is a form of practical atheism, where people live as if God does not exist or will not hold them accountable. The phrase underscores the moral and spiritual decay of the society, which leads to their downfall, as seen throughout the prophetic literature. It serves as a warning against complacency and a call to recognize God's sovereignty and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The verse teaches that sin is never merely personal; it scars creation, drains prosperity, and invites divine response. Yet the very fact that Jeremiah can ask &#8220;How long?&#8221; shows that God listens, cares, and has a set limit to judgment. His eventual answer is found at the cross and in the promised restoration when &#8220;creation itself will be liberated&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). Until then, the passage calls every believer to humble repentance, stewardship of the world around us, and unshakable confidence that God indeed sees&#8212;and will set all things right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">How long shall the land mourn . . .</span>--The Hebrew punctuation gives a different division, <span class= "ital">How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole field </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>all the open country) <span class= "ital">wither?

A slightly different reading, however, adopted by the LXX. and by some modern scholars, would give for the last clause, "He (God) seeth not our <span class= "ital">ways," i.e., </span>will leave us unpunished. The opening words point to a time of distress, probably of drought and famine. But out of this wretchedness, the men who were Jeremiah's enemies--the forestallers, and monopolists, and usurers of the time--continued to enrich themselves, and scornfully defied all his warnings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How long</span>, etc.? The verse is decided rather differently by the Hebrew accents. The question should end at <span class="cmt_word">wither</span>, and the following words run on. <span class="cmt_word">Every field</span> should be <span class="accented">the whole field</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> open country). The connection has caused some difficulty. But drought is constantly described as a judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24, 25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2-7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-10.htm">Jeremiah 23:10</a>), and it is a prophetic doctrine that the lower animals suffer for the fault of man. <span class="cmt_word">Because they said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because they say</span>. The speakers are the ungodly. The subject of the following verb is uncertain. Some think it is God; but when God is said to "see" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> take notice of) anything, it is always something actually existing. The subject must, therefore, be the prophet, of whom the ungodly scoffingly declare, <span class="cmt_word">He shall not see our last end,</span> because his predictions are mere delusions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How long</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
