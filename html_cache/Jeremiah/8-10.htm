The giving of wives to other men and fields to new owners signifies the loss of family and property, which were central to Israelite identity and stability. This punishment is a direct result of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where disobedience leads to such losses. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled during the Babylonian exile when the Israelites were taken captive, and their lands were occupied by others. The loss of land and family was a severe judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of their sin and the breaking of the covenant with God.<p><b>For from the least of them to the greatest, all are greedy for gain;</b><br>This phrase highlights the pervasive corruption and moral decay among the people of Judah. The greed for gain is not limited to a specific class but is widespread, affecting everyone from the least to the greatest. This reflects a society where materialism and self-interest have overtaken righteousness and justice. The Bible frequently condemns greed, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, where it is described as a root of all kinds of evil. The societal breakdown due to greed is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, indicating a departure from God's laws and a focus on personal enrichment at the expense of others.<p><b>from prophet to priest, all practice deceit.</b><br>The mention of both prophets and priests practicing deceit underscores the corruption within the religious leadership of Judah. Prophets and priests were supposed to be the spiritual guides and moral compasses for the people, yet they were leading them astray. This deceit could involve false prophecies, misleading teachings, or corrupt practices within the temple. In <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-14</a>, similar accusations are made, showing a consistent pattern of religious leaders failing in their duties. This failure is significant because it points to a deeper spiritual crisis, where those entrusted with God's word and worship are themselves compromised. The New Testament also warns against false prophets and teachers, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> and <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, emphasizing the need for discernment and faithfulness to God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing impending judgment due to its persistent sin and rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_and_priests.htm">Prophets and Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Judah who were expected to guide the people in truth but were instead complicit in deceit and corruption.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wives_and_fields.htm">Wives and Fields</a></b><br>Symbolic of the consequences of sin, where personal and communal stability is disrupted due to unfaithfulness and greed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The event of divine retribution that Jeremiah warns about, where God allows the consequences of the people's sins to unfold.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_greed_and_deceit.htm">The Consequences of Greed and Deceit</a></b><br>Greed and deceit lead to societal breakdown and personal loss.

As a consequence, God hands over the most precious earthly blessings&#8212;families and fields&#8212;to others, using the Babylonian invasion as the means. The verse reminds us that sin&#8217;s reach is communal, its cost is devastating, and God&#8217;s holiness guarantees that judgment will match the offense.

They are omitted in the Septuagint, and Hitzig regards them as an interpolation, at any rate from the point where the present passage coincides verbally with its parallel. His grounds are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Ver. 13 follows more naturally on Ver. 10 ("... them that shall inherit them") than on Ver. 12; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Ver. 10 is deficient in symmetry; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the deviations from <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a> sometimes loosen the connection of the clauses, sometimes sink into the colloquial style. The arguments seem to be inconclusive. Jeremiah is apt to repeat himself (Graf refers to Ver. 14 = <a href="/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>; Ver. 15 - <a href="/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-9.htm">Jeremiah 5:9</a> = 5:29, 9:8; <a href="/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a> = 11:14; <a href="/jeremiah/50-41.htm">Jeremiah 50:41-43</a> = 6:22-24; <a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:44 - 46 = 49:19-21); and the element which is common to this paragraph and to oh: 6:12-15 seems equally appropriate in both connections.
