This law was intended to protect the sanctity of marriage and prevent the exploitation of women. In the context of Jeremiah, this serves as an analogy for Israel's unfaithfulness to God. The cultural understanding of marriage as a covenant reflects the seriousness of Israel's spiritual adultery.<p><b>Would not such a land be completely defiled?</b><br>The defilement of the land is a common theme in the Old Testament, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption. In <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-28</a>, the land is said to be defiled by the sins of its inhabitants, leading to its eventual expulsion of them. Here, the land represents the spiritual state of the people, defiled by their unfaithfulness and idolatry. This defilement is not just a personal issue but affects the entire community and their relationship with God.<p><b>But you have played the harlot with many lovers&#8212;</b><br>The imagery of harlotry is frequently used in the Bible to describe Israel's idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a> uses similar language to depict Israel's spiritual adultery. The "many lovers" symbolize the various idols and foreign alliances Israel pursued instead of remaining faithful to God. This metaphor highlights the gravity of Israel's sin and the betrayal of their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and you would return to Me?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the audacity of Israel's expectation to return to God without genuine repentance. Despite their unfaithfulness, God still calls them to return, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12-14</a>. This reflects God's enduring mercy and willingness to forgive, foreshadowing the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, where reconciliation and redemption are offered to all who repent and believe.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "declares the LORD" emphasizes the authority and finality of God's pronouncement. It serves as a reminder that these are not merely the words of the prophet Jeremiah but the divine message from God Himself. This authoritative declaration calls the people to heed the warning and return to a faithful relationship with God, highlighting the seriousness of their spiritual condition and the urgency of repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The direct reference is to <a href="/deuteronomy/24-4.htm" title="Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>, which forbade the return to the past husband as an abomination, a law which the recent discovery of the Book of the Law (<a href="/context/2_kings/22-10.htm" title="And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.">2Kings 22:10-11</a>) had probably brought into prominence. But there is also an obvious allusion to the like imagery in Hosea. There the prophet had done, literally or in parable, what the law had forbidden (<a href="/hosea/2-16.htm" title="And it shall be at that day, said the LORD, that you shall call me Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali.">Hosea 2:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-3.htm" title="And I said to her, You shall abide for me many days; you shall not play the harlot, and you shall not be for another man: so will I also be for you.">Hosea 3:3</a>), and so had held out the possibility of return and the hope of pardon. Jeremiah has to play a sterner part. and to make the apostate adulteress at least feel that she had sinned too deeply to have any claims to forgiveness. It might seem as if Jehovah could not now return to the love of His espousals, and make her what she once had been.<p><span class= "bld">Yet return again to me, saith the Lord.</span>--The words sound in the English like a gracious invitation, and--in spite of the authority of many interpreters who take it as an indignant exclamation, <span class= "ital">and return to me! </span>an invitation given in irony, and so equivalent to rejection, as though that return were out of the question--it must, I think, be so taken. The prophet has, as we have seen, the history of Hosea in his mind, where there had been such a call to return (<a href="/hosea/2-19.htm" title="And I will betroth you to me for ever; yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies.">Hosea 2:19</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-3.htm" title="And I said to her, You shall abide for me many days; you shall not play the harlot, and you shall not be for another man: so will I also be for you.">Hosea 3:3</a>), and actually refers to it and repeats it in <a href="/jeremiah/3-7.htm" title="And I said after she had done all these things, Turn you to me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.">Jeremiah 3:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm" title="Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, said the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall on you: for I am merciful, said the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.">Jeremiah 3:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-14.htm" title="Turn, O backsliding children, said the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:">Jeremiah 3:14</a>. It surely implies a want of insight into the character of Jeremiah to suppose that he ever came before men as proclaiming an irrevocable condemnation, excluding the possibility of repentance. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They say</span>, etc.; as the margin of Authorized Version correctly states, the Hebrew simply has "saying." Various ingenious attempts have been made to explain this. Hitzig, for instance, followed by Dr. Payne Smith, thinks that "saying" may be an unusual equivalent for "that is to say," "for example," or the like; while the Vulgate and Rashi, followed by De Wette and Rosenm&uuml;ller, assume an ellipsis, and render, "It is commonly said," or "I might say." But far the most natural way is to suppose that "saying" is a fragment of the superscription of the prophecy, the remainder of which has been accidentally placed in ver. 6, and that we should read, "And the word of the Lord came unto me in the days of Josiah the king, saying." So J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Graf, Naegelsbach. <span class="cmt_word">If a man put away his wife</span>. The argument is founded on the law of <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>, which forbade an Israelite who had divorced his wife to take her again, if in the interval she had been married to another. The Jews had broken a still more sacred tie, not once only, but repeatedly; they worshipped "gods many and lords many;" so that they had no longer any claim on Jehovah in virtue of his "covenant" with his people. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he return</span>, etc.? rather, <span class="accented">Ought he to return?</span> The force of the term is potential (comp. Authorized Version of <a href="/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a>, "which thing ought not to be done"). <span class="cmt_word">Shall not</span> in the next clause is rather <span class="accented">would not</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Yet return again to me.</span> So Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, and the view may seem to be confirmed by the invitations in vers. 12, 14, 22. But as it is obviously inconsistent with the argument of the verse, and as the verb may equally well be the infinitive or the imperative, most recent commentators render, "And thinkest thou to return to me?" (literally, <span class="accented">and</span> returning to me! implying that the very idea is inconceivable). Probably Jeremiah was aware that many of the Jews were dissatisfied with the religious condition of the nation (comp. ver. 4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">divorces</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;al&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
