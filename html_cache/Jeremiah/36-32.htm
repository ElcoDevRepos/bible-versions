This act signifies the enduring nature of God's word, which cannot be extinguished by human actions. Scrolls were the primary medium for writing during this period, made from papyrus or parchment, emphasizing the labor-intensive process of recording God's messages.<p><b>and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah</b><br>Baruch, a faithful scribe and companion of Jeremiah, plays a crucial role in documenting the prophet's messages. Scribes were essential in ancient times for recording and preserving important texts. Baruch's lineage, being the son of Neriah, suggests a family of some standing, possibly with connections to the temple or royal court, highlighting the importance of his role.<p><b>and at Jeremiah&#8217;s dictation he wrote on it all the words of the scroll</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine inspiration of the scriptures, as Jeremiah dictates the words given by God. The process of dictation and transcription ensures the accuracy and preservation of the prophetic message. This mirrors the process by which many biblical texts were composed, emphasizing the collaborative effort between prophet and scribe.<p><b>that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire</b><br>King Jehoiakim's act of burning the scroll represents a rejection of God's word and a defiance of divine authority. This historical event reflects the political and spiritual climate of Judah at the time, where leaders often resisted prophetic warnings. The burning of the scroll is a symbolic act of rebellion against God, yet it also sets the stage for the reaffirmation of His word.<p><b>And many similar words were added to them</b><br>The addition of "many similar words" indicates that God's message is not only preserved but expanded. This suggests that the destruction of the first scroll did not hinder the prophetic mission but rather enriched it. Theologically, this can be seen as a testament to God's sovereignty and the inexhaustible nature of His revelation. The expansion of the message may also include further warnings, promises, or insights relevant to the people of Judah, reinforcing the comprehensive nature of God's communication through His prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch_son_of_neriah.htm">Baruch son of Neriah</a></b><br>Jeremiah's faithful scribe and companion, who played a crucial role in recording and preserving Jeremiah's prophecies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim,_king_of_judah.htm">Jehoiakim, King of Judah</a></b><br>The king who rejected God's word by burning the scroll containing Jeremiah's prophecies, symbolizing his defiance against God's warnings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>Represents the written word of God, initially destroyed by Jehoiakim but rewritten by Baruch under Jeremiah's dictation, signifying the indestructibility and perseverance of God's word.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fire.htm">The Fire</a></b><br>Symbolizes the attempt to destroy God's message, which ultimately fails as God's word is preserved and even expanded.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_indestructibility_of_god's_word.htm">The Indestructibility of God's Word</a></b><br>Despite human efforts to suppress or destroy it, God's word remains eternal and unchanging.
