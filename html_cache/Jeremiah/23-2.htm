The term "shepherds" refers to the leaders of Israel, including kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for guiding and caring for the people. In biblical times, shepherding was a common occupation, and the metaphor of shepherds for leaders is used throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>). The leaders were expected to protect and nurture the people, much like a shepherd does with sheep.<p><b>You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not attended to them:</b><br>Here, God accuses the leaders of failing in their duties. Instead of gathering and caring for the people, they have caused division and dispersion. This scattering can be understood both literally, as in the exile of the Israelites, and spiritually, as in leading the people away from true worship. The leaders' neglect and misguidance have resulted in the people being spiritually lost and vulnerable. This echoes the warnings found in <a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4-6</a>, where God condemns the shepherds for their failure to care for the flock.<p><b>Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your deeds, declares the LORD:</b><br>God promises to hold the leaders accountable for their actions. The phrase "I will attend to you" indicates divine judgment and retribution. This is a common theme in prophetic literature, where God assures that He will not let injustice and neglect go unpunished. The "evil of your deeds" highlights the moral and spiritual corruption of the leaders, which has led to the suffering of the people. This judgment serves as a warning and a call to repentance, emphasizing God's justice and righteousness. The concept of divine retribution is also seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-3</a> and <a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>, where leaders are held accountable for their failure to uphold God's standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Jeremiah, expressing His judgment against the leaders of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shepherds.htm">The Shepherds</a></b><br>Symbolic of the leaders of Israel, including kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for guiding and caring for God's people but failed in their duties.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, who have been neglected and scattered due to the failure of their leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message of judgment and impending accountability for the leaders of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, currently suffering due to the misguidance and neglect of its leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_of_leaders.htm">Accountability of Leaders</a></b><br>God holds leaders accountable for their actions, especially when they neglect their responsibilities.
