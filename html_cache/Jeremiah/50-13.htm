The wrath of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with God's righteous anger against sin and rebellion. In the context of Jeremiah, Babylon is the instrument of God's judgment against Judah, but it is also subject to judgment for its own sins. This reflects the biblical principle that God holds all nations accountable. The wrath of God is not arbitrary but is a response to persistent sin and idolatry, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a> and <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>.<p><b>she will not be inhabited</b><br>This prophecy foretells the complete desolation of Babylon. Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire, but it eventually fell to the Medes and Persians in 539 BC. The phrase indicates a total and lasting desolation, which aligns with the historical decline of Babylon, eventually becoming uninhabited ruins. This fulfills the prophecy and serves as a warning of the consequences of pride and idolatry, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a>.<p><b>she will become completely desolate</b><br>The complete desolation of Babylon is emphasized here, underscoring the totality of God's judgment. Archaeological evidence supports the eventual desolation of Babylon, which once was a thriving city. This desolation serves as a type of the final judgment and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over earthly powers, as seen in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon symbolizes the world system opposed to God.<p><b>All who pass through Babylon will be horrified</b><br>This phrase captures the reaction of those who witness Babylon's downfall. The horror reflects the shock and awe at the sudden and complete destruction of what was once a great empire. This serves as a testament to God's power and the certainty of His prophetic word. It also parallels the reaction to the fall of other cities under divine judgment, such as Nineveh (<a href="/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a>).<p><b>and will hiss at all her wounds</b><br>Hissing is a cultural expression of scorn and derision in the ancient Near East. The wounds of Babylon symbolize the consequences of its pride and rebellion against God. This imagery is used elsewhere in scripture to describe the reaction to divine judgment, as in <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>. It serves as a reminder of the futility of opposing God's will and the inevitable downfall of those who do.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>An ancient city and empire known for its wealth, power, and opposition to God&#8217;s people.
