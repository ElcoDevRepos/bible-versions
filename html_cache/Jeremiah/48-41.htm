The capture of Kirioth symbolizes the downfall of Moab's power and influence. Historically, Moab was often in conflict with Israel, and its cities were fortified against invasions. The taking of Kirioth indicates a decisive victory over Moab, fulfilling the prophecy of judgment against them. This event is part of a broader narrative where God uses foreign nations to execute His judgment, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>and the strongholds seized.</b><br>The strongholds refer to the fortified places within Moab that were considered impenetrable. The seizing of these strongholds demonstrates the totality of Moab's defeat. In ancient warfare, capturing strongholds was crucial for ensuring control over a region. This phrase emphasizes the thoroughness of God's judgment, as even the most secure places are not immune to His will. It reflects the theme of divine sovereignty over nations, a recurring motif in the prophetic literature.<p><b>In that day the heart of Moab&#8217;s warriors</b><br>The phrase "in that day" often refers to a specific time of divine intervention or judgment. The warriors of Moab, known for their strength and valor, are depicted here in a state of fear and vulnerability. This imagery contrasts with their usual portrayal as fierce and formidable, highlighting the overwhelming nature of the calamity they face. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of emotion and courage, indicating a profound internal collapse.<p><b>will be like the heart of a woman in labor.</b><br>This simile conveys intense fear and distress, akin to the pain and anxiety experienced during childbirth. In the ancient Near Eastern context, labor was a time of great vulnerability and uncertainty, often used metaphorically to describe extreme anguish. The comparison underscores the complete reversal of Moab's fortunes, as their warriors, once symbols of strength, are reduced to a state of helplessness. This imagery is used elsewhere in scripture, such as in Isaiah and Jeremiah, to depict the terror of impending judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kerioth.htm">Kerioth</a></b><br>A city in Moab, often associated with strength and fortification.
