His role was to oversee the destruction of the city and the deportation of its inhabitants. This event marks the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecies regarding the fall of Jerusalem due to the people's disobedience to God.

His capture and subsequent execution (as noted in <a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18-21</a>) symbolize the end of the temple worship system in Jerusalem. The high priest held a significant role in mediating between God and the people, and his removal indicates a severe spiritual judgment on the nation.

Their capture represents the complete breakdown of temple operations and the cessation of its protective and sanctifying functions.
