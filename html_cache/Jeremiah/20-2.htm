Beating was a common punishment for those seen as troublemakers or false prophets. This act reflects the hostility Jeremiah faced from religious and political leaders who rejected his warnings. It highlights the suffering endured by prophets, prefiguring the suffering of Christ, who was also beaten and rejected.<p><b>and put in the stocks</b><br>Stocks were a form of public humiliation and torture, designed to inflict pain and shame. This punishment indicates the severity of the opposition Jeremiah faced. It symbolizes the rejection of God's message by the people and leaders of Judah. The use of stocks also foreshadows the suffering and humiliation Christ would endure, as He was mocked and scorned by those He came to save.<p><b>at the Upper Gate of Benjamin</b><br>The Upper Gate of Benjamin was a significant location in Jerusalem, likely situated on the northern side of the city, leading to the territory of Benjamin. Gates were central to city life, serving as places of judgment and public discourse. This location underscores the public nature of Jeremiah's punishment, intended to serve as a warning to others. It also connects to the tribe of Benjamin, which had historical significance in Israel's history, including being the tribe of King Saul.<p><b>which was by the house of the LORD</b><br>The proximity to the house of the LORD, or the temple, is significant. It highlights the irony and tragedy of Jeremiah's punishment occurring near the very place where God's presence was believed to dwell. This setting emphasizes the spiritual blindness of the leaders who, while serving in the temple, failed to recognize God's true messenger. It also prefigures the rejection of Jesus, who cleansed the temple and was ultimately crucified outside the city, near the place of worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

Chapter 20 records his honest lament yet renewed resolve, echoing <a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a> and <a href="/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24-25</a> where confinement could not cancel testimony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At the Upper Gate of Benjamin</b><p>&#8226; The Upper (or North) Gate of Benjamin sat on the northern side of the temple area, the gate through which the Benjaminites entered Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Positioning Jeremiah there made his suffering visible to travelers and worshipers&#8212;an attempt to discredit his message before the nation, much as Amaziah tried to expel Amos from Bethel (<a href="/amos/7-12.htm">Amos 7:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The location fulfills God&#8217;s warning in <a href="/jeremiah/19-14.htm">Jeremiah 19:14-15</a> that judgment would be proclaimed &#8220;in the court of the LORD&#8217;s house,&#8221; and now the rejection of that warning happens at the very threshold.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which was by the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Ironically, the punishment occurs beside the sanctuary meant for truth and mercy (<a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; It exposes the spiritual blindness of leaders who honor the temple structure yet despise the God who indwells it (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4-11</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates Christ Himself, who would be struck and mocked within the high priest&#8217;s courtyard (<a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67-68</a>), showing the pattern of religious power persecuting God&#8217;s mouthpieces.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a> records a real, public assault on God&#8217;s prophet: beaten, locked in painful stocks, displayed at a prominent gate adjoining the temple.

Other prophets had, under Ahab or Manasseh, been slain with the sword, but none, so far as we know (with the one exception of Hanani the seer in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-10.htm" title="Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.">2Chronicles 16:10</a>), had ever before been subjected to an ignominious punishment such as this. It was so far analogous to the outrage against which St. Paul protested in <a href="/context/acts/23-2.htm" title="And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.">Acts 23:2-3</a>. The word "smote" implies a blow struck with the priest's own hands rather than the infliction of the legal punishment of forty stripes save one (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-3.htm" title="Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>). The English word "stocks" expresses adequately enough the instrument of torture which, like the <span class= "ital">nervus </span>of Roman punishment, kept the body (as in <a href="/acts/16-24.htm" title="Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.">Acts 16:24</a>) in a crooked and painful position. The word here used occurs in the Hebrew of <a href="/2_chronicles/16-10.htm" title="Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.">2Chronicles 16:10</a>, as above, and in <a href="/jeremiah/29-26.htm" title="The LORD has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison, and in the stocks.">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, but the A. V. there renders it as "prison-house." In that humiliating position the prophet was left for the whole night in one of the most conspicuous places of the city, the temple-gate of Benjamin (the <span class= "ital">upper </span>gate) on the northern side of the inner court, probably the higher or northern gate of <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-5.htm" title="Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.">Ezekiel 8:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.">Ezekiel 9:2</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Pashur, being charged with the police of the temple, smites Jeremiah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> causes stripes to be given him (a legal punishment, <a href="/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>; comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>), and then orders him to be put into <span class="cmt_word">the stocks</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that which distorts -</span> some instrument of punishment which held the body in a bent or crooked position (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>).

It is presumably the same which is called "the new gate of the Lord's house" (<a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>), as having been comparatively lately built (<a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[he]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;a&#353;&#183;&#7717;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6583.htm">Strong's 6583: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pashhur -- five Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had Jeremiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;m&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3414.htm">Strong's 3414: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jeremiah -- 'Yah loosens', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the prophet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
