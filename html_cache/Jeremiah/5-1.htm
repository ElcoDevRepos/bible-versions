The command to go up and down the streets suggests a thorough investigation. Historically, Jerusalem was a bustling city with significant religious importance, housing the Temple. The imagery of walking through the streets implies a search for righteousness amidst widespread corruption.<p><b>Look now and take note;</b><br>The directive to "look now and take note" emphasizes the urgency and seriousness of the task. It calls for careful observation and discernment. This reflects the prophetic role of Jeremiah, who was tasked with delivering God's message and assessing the spiritual state of the people.<p><b>search her squares.</b><br>The squares were public places where people gathered, making them ideal locations to observe the behavior and character of the populace. In ancient cities, squares were centers of commerce and social interaction, providing a cross-section of society. This search highlights the pervasive nature of the moral decline in Jerusalem.<p><b>If you can find a single person,</b><br>The challenge to find even one righteous person underscores the depth of the nation's spiritual decay. This echoes the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, where Abraham intercedes for the cities, and God agrees to spare them if even ten righteous people are found. The comparison highlights the severity of Jerusalem's condition.<p><b>anyone who acts justly,</b><br>Justice is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting God's character and expectations for His people. Acting justly involves living according to God's laws and treating others with fairness and integrity. The absence of justice in Jerusalem indicates a departure from covenantal faithfulness.<p><b>anyone who seeks the truth,</b><br>Seeking the truth involves a commitment to God's word and a desire for honesty and integrity. In a society where deceit and falsehood prevail, the search for truth becomes a rare and valuable pursuit. This phrase points to the importance of aligning one's life with divine truth.<p><b>then I will forgive the city.</b><br>God's willingness to forgive the city if even one righteous person is found demonstrates His mercy and desire for repentance. This conditional promise highlights the power of intercession and the potential for redemption. It also foreshadows the ultimate forgiveness offered through Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect justice and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

It is, of course, possible that parts of the picture may have been worked up when the prophecies were rewritten under Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/36-32.htm" title="Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides to them many like words.">Jeremiah 36:32</a>); but, on the other hand, it is equally possible that the prophet may have seen even at the time how hollow and incomplete that reformation was. The form in which he utters his conviction reminds one of the old story of the Greek sage, Diogenes, appearing in the streets of Athens with a lantern, searching for an honest man. In the thought that the pardon of the city depended on its containing some elements of good which might make reformation possible, we find an echo of <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>; but the picture is of a state more utterly hopeless. There were not ten righteous men found in Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-32.htm" title="And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.
