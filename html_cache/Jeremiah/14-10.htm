The "LORD" refers to Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel, highlighting the personal relationship and expectations He has with His people. This context is crucial as it underscores the gravity of the message being delivered to a nation that has repeatedly broken their covenant with God.<p><b>Truly they love to wander;</b><br>The imagery of wandering suggests a lack of commitment and faithfulness, akin to a sheep straying from its shepherd. This reflects Israel's spiritual adultery, as they pursued other gods and neglected their covenant with Yahweh. The concept of wandering is also seen in <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>, where God laments Israel's tendency to turn away from Him.<p><b>they have not restrained their feet.</b><br>This phrase indicates a willful disobedience and a refusal to return to the right path. In ancient Near Eastern culture, feet often symbolize one's path or way of life. The lack of restraint suggests a deliberate choice to continue in sin, ignoring the guidance and commandments of God.<p><b>So the LORD does not accept them;</b><br>Here, the consequence of Israel's actions is made clear. God's acceptance is contingent upon obedience and faithfulness. This rejection echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's adherence to God's law. The lack of acceptance signifies a broken relationship and impending judgment.<p><b>He will now remember their iniquity</b><br>The act of remembering iniquity implies that God will hold them accountable for their sins. This is a reversal of the promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, where God speaks of a future covenant where He will forgive and forget their sins. The current context, however, is one of judgment due to persistent rebellion.<p><b>and punish them for their sins.</b><br>The punishment is a direct result of their continued disobedience and idolatry. This reflects the justice of God, who cannot overlook sin. The historical context includes the impending Babylonian exile, a fulfillment of prophetic warnings due to the nation's unfaithfulness. This punishment serves as both a consequence and a means to bring about repentance and eventual restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's prophecy, who are being rebuked for their unfaithfulness and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wandering.htm">Wandering</a></b><br>A metaphor for the spiritual unfaithfulness and idolatry of the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity_and_punishment.htm">Iniquity and Punishment</a></b><br>The consequences of the people's persistent sin and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_spiritual_wandering.htm">The Danger of Spiritual Wandering</a></b><br>Just as the people of Judah loved to wander, Christians today must guard against spiritual drift and unfaithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_restraint.htm">The Importance of Restraint</a></b><br>The lack of restraint in the people's actions led to their downfall.

The opening word "thus" appears to point back to the "many backslidings" of <a href="/jeremiah/14-7.htm" title="O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do you it for your name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.">Jeremiah 14:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-16.</span> - The answer of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus have they loved to wander, ... therefore the Lord doth not accept them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with such pertinacity have they been set upon "wandering" (roving lawlessly about), that the Lord hath no more pleasure in them. "Therefore," is, literally, <span class="accented">and</span>. "Thus," or "so," is used in the same sense as in <a href="/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a>, which runs literally, "... there came not so [abundantly] among timber." The particle of comparison has given much occupation to the commentators (see Payne Smith's note), but the above view is at once simple and suitable to the context; for Jeremiah has already admitted that "our backslidings are multiplied" (Ver. 7). <span class="accented">The Lord doth not</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. (to the end of the verse), is quoted <span class="accented">verbatim</span> from <a href="/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>. Jeremiah puts conspicuous honor on the older inspired writers; he has no craving for originality. Nearly all has been said already; what he has to do is chiefly to adapt and to apply, <span class="cmt_word">He will now remember</span>, etc. The emphasis is on "now" Nothing is more remarkable in the prophets than the stress laid on the unerring justness of the time chosen for Divine interpositions. When the iniquity is fully ripe, it as it were attracts the punishment, which till then is laid up in store (comp. <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>;
