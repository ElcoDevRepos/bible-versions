The specific mention of the ninth day highlights the precision of the biblical record, emphasizing the historical accuracy of the events described. This date marks a significant moment in the history of Jerusalem, as it was the culmination of a long siege by the Babylonians.<p><b>of Zedekiah&#8217;s eleventh year</b><br>Zedekiah was the last king of Judah, reigning from 597 to 586 BC. His reign was marked by political instability and rebellion against Babylonian rule. The eleventh year of his reign is significant because it marks the end of the Davidic line of kings ruling in Jerusalem until the coming of Christ, who is often seen as the fulfillment of the Davidic covenant. Zedekiah's reign ended with the fall of Jerusalem, a pivotal event in Jewish history.<p><b>the city was breached</b><br>The breaching of Jerusalem's walls was a catastrophic event for the people of Judah. It signified the end of the city's defenses and the beginning of its destruction. This breach was the result of a prolonged siege by Nebuchadnezzar's army, which had begun in the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign. The fall of Jerusalem fulfilled the prophecies of Jeremiah and other prophets who had warned of the consequences of the nation's disobedience to God. The breaching of the city can also be seen as a type of Christ's suffering, as He was "breached" or pierced for our transgressions, bringing about spiritual deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, whose reign ended with the Babylonian conquest.
