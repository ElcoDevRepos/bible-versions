Josiah was known for his religious reforms and efforts to return Judah to the worship of Yahweh, as described in <a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22-23</a>. His reign was marked by a significant spiritual revival, including the discovery of the Book of the Law in the temple. This period was crucial as it was a time of potential repentance and renewal for Judah, contrasting with the northern kingdom of Israel, which had already fallen to Assyria in 722 BC.<p><b>the LORD said to me</b><br>This indicates that the message is a direct revelation from God to the prophet Jeremiah. Jeremiah, called as a prophet in his youth, served as a mouthpiece for God, delivering messages of warning, judgment, and hope to the people of Judah. The divine origin of the message underscores its authority and the seriousness with which it should be received.<p><b>&#8220;Have you seen what faithless Israel has done?</b><br>Here, God refers to the northern kingdom of Israel, which had been characterized by idolatry and apostasy. The term "faithless" highlights Israel's breach of covenant with God, as they turned away from Him to worship other gods. This rhetorical question serves to draw attention to Israel's spiritual adultery and serves as a warning to Judah, which was following a similar path despite Josiah's reforms.<p><b>She has gone up on every high hill</b><br>The "high hills" were often sites of pagan worship, where altars and shrines to foreign gods were erected. This practice was common in the ancient Near East, where high places were considered closer to the divine realm. Israel's use of these sites for idolatry was a direct violation of God's command to worship Him alone and in the manner He prescribed.<p><b>and under every green tree</b><br>The phrase "under every green tree" is a common biblical metaphor for idolatrous worship practices. Trees were often associated with fertility cults and were used as symbols or locations for worshiping deities like Baal and Asherah. This imagery emphasizes the pervasive nature of Israel's unfaithfulness, as they engaged in idolatry in numerous locations.<p><b>to prostitute herself there.</b><br>This metaphor of prostitution is frequently used in the Bible to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God. It conveys the idea of spiritual adultery, where Israel, likened to an unfaithful spouse, has abandoned her covenant relationship with God to pursue other gods. This imagery is powerful, illustrating the depth of Israel's betrayal and the grievousness of their sin. It also serves as a call to repentance, highlighting the need for Israel and Judah to return to their covenantal obligations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during whose reign Jeremiah began his prophetic ministry.

Idols are being smashed, the temple repaired, and the lost Book of the Law rediscovered. Yet even during this reform, God reminds Jeremiah that the northern kingdom&#8217;s earlier collapse still shouts a warning. The faithfulness of a king cannot erase the covenant breach of a nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD said to me</b><p>This isn&#8217;t Jeremiah&#8217;s opinion; it is God&#8217;s direct word (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4&#8211;10</a>). By stressing divine authorship, Scripture underscores its own reliability and authority (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). When God speaks, His verdict stands, whether in Josiah&#8217;s day or ours.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Have you seen what faithless Israel has done?&#8221;</b><p>God invites Jeremiah (and us) to look back at Israel&#8217;s history. The northern tribes had already been exiled by Assyria for turning from the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6&#8211;23</a>). Calling them &#8220;faithless&#8221; (&#8220;treacherous&#8221; in some translations) contrasts sharply with God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). Their story is meant to be a vivid cautionary tale for Judah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She has gone up on every high hill</b><p>High places were scenic spots used for pagan worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>). Instead of meeting God where He prescribed&#8212;at the temple in Jerusalem&#8212;Israel sought spiritual thrills elsewhere. Worship location reveals loyalty; their choice showed rejection of God&#8217;s exclusive claim (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and under every green tree</b><p>Shaded groves became centers for fertility rites (<a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>). What looks lush and appealing to the eyes so often hides spiritual rot.

Israel&#8217;s covenant with God was a marriage; chasing other gods was prostitution.

The verse warns every generation: genuine revival demands more than surface changes; it calls for covenant loyalty to the LORD alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The Lord said also unto me . . .</span>--The main point of the second prophecy (we might almost call it sermon), delivered, like the former, under Josiah, is the comparison of the guilt of the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The latter had been looking on the former with contemptuous scorn. She is now taught--the same imagery being continued that had begun in the first discourse--that her guilt is by far the greater of the two.<p><span class= "bld">Backsliding Israel.</span>--The epithet strikes the keynote of all that follows, and is, as it were, the text of the sermon.

Some sort of introduction, however, seems called for; Ewald supposes a shorter form, such as "And the Lord said further unto me." The view is not improbable, for although there is evidently a break between ver. 5 and ver. 6, there are points of contact enough between vers. 1-5 and the following discourse to prove that they represent the same prophetic period (comp. ver. 10 with ver. 3, vers. 8, 9 with ver. 1, ver. 12 with ver. 5, ver. 19 with ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">Backsliding Israel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">apostasy Israel</span>.
