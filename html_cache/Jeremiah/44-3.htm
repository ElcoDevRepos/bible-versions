The "evil" refers to their idolatry and disobedience to God's commandments. In the context of Jeremiah, this evil is a recurring theme, as the prophet repeatedly calls out the people's unfaithfulness. The historical backdrop includes the reigns of several kings of Judah who led the nation into idolatry, despite the reforms of kings like Josiah. This evil is not just a breach of law but a violation of the covenant relationship with God, which demanded exclusive worship and obedience.<p><b>They provoked Me to anger</b><br>The provocation of God's anger is a significant theme in the Old Testament, where God's holiness and justice are contrasted with human sinfulness. This phrase indicates that the people's actions were not just passive disobedience but active rebellion against God. The anger of God is not capricious but a righteous response to sin. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7-8</a>, where Israel's rebellion is said to provoke God to wrath. Theologically, this underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance.<p><b>by continuing to burn incense</b><br>Burning incense was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religions, often associated with worship and prayer. In the context of Judah, this practice had been corrupted by the incorporation of pagan rituals. The burning of incense to other gods was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and was symbolic of the people's spiritual adultery. Archaeological findings, such as altars and incense burners, provide evidence of these practices. The persistence in this act signifies a hardened heart and a refusal to return to the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>and to serve other gods</b><br>Serving other gods was a direct breach of the covenant established at Sinai, where God declared Himself as the only true God. This phrase reflects the syncretism that plagued Israel and Judah, where the worship of Yahweh was mixed with the worship of Canaanite deities like Baal and Asherah. The historical context includes the influence of surrounding nations and their religions, which often led Israel astray. This idolatry is condemned throughout the prophetic books and is seen as spiritual unfaithfulness akin to adultery.<p><b>that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the foreignness of the gods being worshiped, highlighting that these deities were not part of the heritage or revelation given to the ancestors of Israel. The God of Israel had revealed Himself uniquely to the patriarchs and through the Exodus, establishing a relationship based on knowledge and covenant. The worship of unknown gods represents a departure from this revealed truth. This is reminiscent of Paul's speech in <a href="/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, where he speaks of the "unknown god" to the Athenians, contrasting the true God with their ignorance. Theologically, this underscores the importance of knowing God as He has revealed Himself, rather than through human invention or tradition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
