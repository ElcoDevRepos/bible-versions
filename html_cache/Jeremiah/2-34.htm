In ancient Near Eastern culture, garments often symbolized one's moral and spiritual state. The "skirts" being stained suggests a deep-seated corruption and injustice. The "blood of the innocent poor" highlights the exploitation and oppression of vulnerable individuals, a recurring theme in the prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-17</a>, <a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11-12</a>). This accusation reflects the societal injustices prevalent in Judah, where the powerful often took advantage of the weak, contrary to the covenantal laws that called for justice and care for the poor (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>).<p><b>though you did not find them breaking in</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the innocence of the victims. The phrase "breaking in" refers to the act of burglary or theft, which, according to <a href="/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2-3</a>, could justify defensive actions. However, the text emphasizes that the poor were not guilty of such crimes, yet they suffered as if they were. This highlights the perversion of justice in Judah, where the innocent were punished while the guilty went free. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of true justice, as outlined in the Mosaic Law, and the failure of the leaders to uphold it.<p><b>But in spite of all these things</b><br>This phrase introduces a sense of incredulity and condemnation. Despite the clear evidence of wrongdoing and the prophetic warnings, the people of Judah remained unrepentant. This reflects a broader biblical theme of human stubbornness and the rejection of God's call to repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>). It also foreshadows the impending judgment that would come upon Judah due to their persistent disobedience and moral decay, as prophesied throughout the book of Jeremiah. This serves as a call to self-examination and repentance, urging the audience to turn back to God before it is too late.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was often rebuked by God through prophets like Jeremiah for its idolatry and injustice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_innocent_poor.htm">The Innocent Poor</a></b><br>Represents the vulnerable and marginalized individuals in society who were unjustly treated by the people of Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and the one who sees the injustices committed by His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_skirts.htm">The Skirts</a></b><br>Symbolic of the outward appearance or actions of the people, indicating guilt and wrongdoing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_injustice.htm">The Seriousness of Injustice</a></b><br>God takes the shedding of innocent blood seriously, and it is a sin that cries out for justice.

No matter how carefully Judah tried to present itself, the blood revealed hidden sin.

Their "blood" is on the "skirts" of her raiment; perhaps, if we take another reading, on the "palms" of her hands. The last clause is, however, obscure enough. We have to choose, according to variations of reading and construction, between (1) <span class= "ital">I have not found it as by secret search </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">by digging, </span>as men dig through the wall of a house in search of plunder), <span class= "ital">but under every oak </span>or <span class= "ital">terebinth, </span>or, more probably, as in the Authorised version, <span class= "ital">upon all these</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the sin was patent, flagrant, everywhere; and (2) <span class= "ital">Thou didst not find them </span>(those who had been put to death) <span class= "ital">in the place of breaking through</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., in the act of the robber that would have deserved death </span>(<a href="/exodus/22-2.htm" title="If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.">Exodus 22:2</a>; <a href="/job/24-16.htm" title="In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.">Job 24:16</a>); <span class= "ital">but because of all this</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>thou didst slay them through thy passion for idolatry. Of these (1) commends itself most.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also in thy skirts</span>, etc.; or, <span class="accented">there is even fennel in thy skirts</span> (or, perhaps, <span class="accented">in thy sleeves</span> - the wide sleeves of an Eastern mantle). The fact which follows is adduced as the crowning evidence of wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Blood of the souls</span> is explained by the statement in <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "The soul of the flesh [i.e. of the body] is in the blood;" hence the importance of the blood in the Mosaic sacrifices. The historical reference of this passage of Jeremiah may well be to the persecution of Manasseh, who is said to have "shed innocent blood very much" (<a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>). It is Judah, no doubt, who is addressed, but the prophets mostly assume the "solidarity" of king and people (analogous to that of a forefather and his posterity); Manasseh, moreover, probably had the support of a large section of the population, at any rate in so far as he favored the inveterate cultus of the high places or local sanctuaries. <span class="cmt_word">I have not found it by secret search</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast not found them breaking through</span> (<span class="accented">houses</span>). The phraseology agrees with that of <a href="/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>, the law against "breaking through;" it suggests that the houses of all but the highest class in ancient as well as often in modern Palestine, were made of mere sun-dried brick, which could be easily "dug into" (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/12-5.htm">Ezekiel 12:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>, in the Greek). [Lieut. Conder states, it is true, that in hilly districts of Palestine the houses of the villages are built of stone, but he adds that the stone is simply taken from the ruins of the ancient towns.] Burglars caught in the act might be killed (<a href="/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>), but the innocent victims of persecution could not be brought under this category, and hence those who slew them were really guilty of murder. <span class="cmt_word">But upon all these</span>;
