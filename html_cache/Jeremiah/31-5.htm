Historically, Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC. The mention of planting vineyards indicates a return to prosperity and stability, as vineyards were a symbol of wealth and blessing in ancient Israel (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>). The use of "again" suggests a reversal of past judgments and a promise of future hope. This restoration can be seen as a fulfillment of God's covenant promises, echoing themes found in passages like <a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14-15</a>, where God promises to restore the fortunes of His people.<p><b>the farmers will plant and enjoy the fruit.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the peace and security that will accompany the restoration. In the context of ancient Israel, farmers often faced threats from invading armies or raiders, which made it difficult to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The assurance that they will "enjoy the fruit" suggests a time of peace and divine protection, reminiscent of the blessings described in <a href="/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4-5</a>, where God promises safety and abundance to those who follow His statutes. This also points to a deeper spiritual truth, where the faithful will ultimately enjoy the fruits of their labor in God's kingdom, drawing a parallel to the New Testament promise of eternal life and reward for believers (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of both warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were in exile during Jeremiah's time, longing for restoration and return to their homeland.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>A region in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, often associated with idolatry and conflict, but here symbolizing restoration and blessing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyards.htm">Vineyards</a></b><br>Symbolic of prosperity, peace, and God's blessing, representing a return to normalcy and abundance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/farmers.htm">Farmers</a></b><br>Representing the people of Israel who will once again engage in the fruitful labor of cultivating the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_hope.htm">Restoration and Hope</a></b><br><a href="/jeremiah/31-5.htm">Jeremiah 31:5</a> is a promise of restoration, reminding us that God is faithful to restore His people after times of hardship and exile.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fruitfulness_in_god's_timing.htm">Fruitfulness in God's Timing</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were promised a time to plant and enjoy, we are reminded that God has a perfect timing for our seasons of fruitfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_vineyards.htm">Symbolism of Vineyards</a></b><br>Vineyards symbolize not only physical prosperity but also spiritual growth and abundance.

The verse reassures us that divine discipline never nullifies divine faithfulness; when God speaks of vineyards on Samaria&#8217;s hills, He means real vines, real hills, real joy&#8212;evidence that His salvation plan moves inexorably from ruin to redemption for all who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria . . .</span>--The mention of Samaria shows that the prophet is thinking of the restoration of the northern kingdom, as well as of Judah, under the rule of the true King. In the Hebrew words "shall eat them as common things" we have a singular train of associations. The primary meaning of the verb is to "profane." The rule of <a href="/context/leviticus/19-23.htm" title="And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.">Leviticus 19:23-24</a>, based partly, perhaps, on grounds of culture, partly with a symbolic meaning, required that a vineyard for three years after it was planted should be treated as "uncircumcised" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that no use should be made of the fruit), in the fourth year the fruit was to "be holy to praise the Lord with," and in the fifth the planter might take the fruit for himself. So accordingly in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-6.htm" title="And what man is he that has planted a vineyard, and has not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.">Deuteronomy 20:6</a> we have, as one of the laws affecting war, that if a man had planted a vineyard and had not made it common--the same word as that used here--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>had not got beyond the fixed period of consecration, he might be exempted from military service, lest he should die and another eat of it. Compare also <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm" title="You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build an house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not gather the grapes thereof.">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where the English "gather" answers, as the marginal reading shows, to the same verb. What is meant here, therefore, is, in contrast with the chances and changes of a time of war, that the planters of the vineyard should not be disturbed in their possession of it. They should not plant, and another eat thereof. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/65-22.htm" title="They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.">Isaiah 65:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm" title="You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build an house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not gather the grapes thereof.">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mountains of Samaria.</span> "Samaria" is used, equally with Ephraim, for the northern kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Shall eat</span> them <span class="cmt_word">as common things;</span> rather, <span class="accented">shall enjoy the fruit.</span> The word, however, literally means <span class="accented">shall profane them.</span> The more common phrase, "shall eat the fruit," occurs in <a href="/isaiah/65-21.htm">Isaiah 65:21</a>, where the same promise is given.
