Moab, a neighboring nation east of the Dead Sea, often mocked Israel, reflecting a long-standing enmity. This ridicule can be traced back to the time of the Exodus when Moab refused to help Israel (Numbers 22-24). The Moabites' derision of Israel is a recurring theme, as seen in their opposition during the reigns of various Israelite kings. This ridicule is not just a social slight but a spiritual affront, as Israel is God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p><b>Was he ever found among thieves?</b><br>This rhetorical question implies that Israel, despite its sins, was not guilty of the kind of treachery or lawlessness that would justify such scorn. Historically, Israel had its share of internal corruption and idolatry, but the nation was not characterized by the kind of criminal behavior that would warrant being labeled as thieves. This phrase may also allude to the unjust treatment Israel received from surrounding nations, who often acted deceitfully or aggressively towards them, as seen in the alliances and betrayals recorded in the books of Kings and Chronicles.<p><b>For whenever you speak of him you shake your head.</b><br>The act of shaking the head is a gesture of scorn or derision, indicating contempt or disbelief. This behavior reflects the Moabites' disdain for Israel, which is consistent with the cultural practices of the time where physical gestures often accompanied verbal insults. This contempt is not just a social issue but a spiritual one, as it reflects a rejection of God's covenant people. The shaking of the head is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus, the ultimate fulfillment of Israel, is mocked in a similar manner during His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a>). This connection underscores the continuity of God's redemptive plan through Israel and ultimately through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often seen as a symbol of God's chosen people.

This isn&#8217;t a passing mockery but a settled disposition: Moab delighted in belittling God&#8217;s covenant people. Similar patterns appear when Edom rejoiced over Judah&#8217;s calamity in <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 12</a>, and when Philistia celebrated Judah&#8217;s fall in <a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>. Scripture repeatedly warns that ridiculing what God has chosen invites His rebuke; <a href="/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a> reminds that &#8220;he who mocks the poor insults his Maker,&#8221; and <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8-10</a> records God&#8217;s anger against Moab and Ammon for taunts and insults. The indictment here is moral and covenantal: contempt for Israel equals contempt for the God who called and preserved Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was he ever found among thieves?</b><p>The question expects a &#8220;no.&#8221; Israel had not plundered Moab, nor been convicted as a band of criminals deserving such disgrace. Jeremiah earlier used the image of a thief caught in <a href="/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>, emphasizing shame that follows proven guilt. By contrast, Moab&#8217;s contempt sprang from arrogance, not justice. <a href="/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a> echoes the principle that no one has the right to condemn another servant of the Lord; God alone is Judge. In scorning Israel without cause, Moab put itself in the dock.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For whenever you speak of him you shake your head.</b><p>The gesture paints a picture of open, habitual contempt, like the head-wagging crowds around the cross in <a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39</a> or the passersby taunting Jerusalem in <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>. <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a> describes people who &#8220;shake their heads&#8221; at the suffering righteous; such mockery amplifies the sufferer&#8217;s pain and magnifies the mocker&#8217;s guilt. Moab&#8217;s constant derision exposed a heart of pride (<a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>) and would soon be answered with the same measure of disgrace it meted out (<a href="/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/48-27.htm">Jeremiah 48:27</a> rebukes Moab for a settled, unjustified contempt toward Israel. Though Israel had not wronged Moab, Moab chose ridicule, head-shaking scorn, and arrogant delight in Israel&#8217;s troubles. God treats such mockery as an offense against Himself; therefore He pronounces judgment on Moab. The verse stands as a sober reminder that belittling God&#8217;s people&#8212;especially when no crime warrants it&#8212;provokes the Lord&#8217;s righteous response, while humility and respect for His covenant purposes invite His favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Was not Israel a derision unto thee?</span>--The "derision" had been shown at an earlier stage in the history of Judah (<a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm" title="I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.">Zephaniah 2:8</a>; comp. <a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have clapped your hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your despite against the land of Israel;">Ezekiel 25:6</a>), but was, we may well believe, reproduced when the Moabites heard of the disasters that fell on Israel in the days of Josiah and his successors. The question that follows "Was he found among thieves?" implies an answer in the negative. Israel had not been among the lawless, aggressive nations, the robbers of the earth. Compare <a href="/2_samuel/3-33.htm" title="And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies?">2Samuel 3:33</a>, where the question, "Died Abner as a fool dieth?" implies that he had not deserved his death as guilty of any crime. By some critics, however, the Hebrew interrogative is taken as meaning "when," and so involving the admission that Israel had been guilty of unjust invasion, and been led to that guilt by her alliance with the robber nations of the heathen.<p><span class= "bld">Thou skippedst for joy.</span>--The gesture described. like the wagging of the head of <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm" title="To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.">Jeremiah 18:16</a>, or the shrugging of the shoulders, is one of triumphant malice. The symbolism of Oriental gesture is, it may be noted, specially rich in expressions of this form of evil.
