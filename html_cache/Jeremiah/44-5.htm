Throughout the book of Jeremiah, the prophet repeatedly calls the people to repentance, yet they consistently refuse to heed his warnings. This reflects a broader biblical theme of human stubbornness and rebellion against God, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>. The phrase "incline their ears" suggests an intentional act of listening, which the people deliberately chose not to do, indicating a hardened heart.<p><b>they did not turn from their wickedness</b><br>The refusal to turn from wickedness underscores the moral and spiritual decline of Judah. The term "wickedness" encompasses idolatry, injustice, and immorality, which were rampant in the society. This is consistent with the covenantal language found in Deuteronomy, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience to God's laws. The call to "turn" is a call to repentance, a central theme in prophetic literature, emphasizing the need for a change of heart and behavior.<p><b>or stop burning incense to other gods.</b><br>Burning incense to other gods was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religions and was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This act of idolatry was not just a religious offense but a breach of the covenant relationship with Yahweh. The worship of other gods often involved syncretism, blending the worship of Yahweh with pagan practices, which was prevalent in Judah despite repeated warnings from prophets like Jeremiah. This idolatry is a direct violation of the first commandment and is seen as spiritual adultery, drawing parallels to the unfaithfulness of Israel as depicted in Hosea.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls to repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which had fallen into idolatry and was facing God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place where the remnant of Judah fled, despite God's warnings, and continued their idolatrous practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_judah.htm">The Remnant of Judah</a></b><br>The group of Israelites who survived the Babylonian conquest and fled to Egypt, continuing in disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The act of worshiping other gods, which was a significant sin that led to Judah's downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_god.htm">The Importance of Listening to God</a></b><br>God repeatedly calls His people to listen and obey.
