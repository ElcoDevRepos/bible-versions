The imagery of a shepherd is significant throughout the Bible, symbolizing leadership, guidance, and care. Jeremiah's commitment reflects the dedication required of spiritual leaders, akin to the perseverance of Moses and David, who were also shepherds of God's people. This phrase underscores the prophet's faithfulness and echoes the ultimate shepherd, Jesus Christ, who declared Himself the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>.<p><b>I have not desired the day of despair.</b><br>Jeremiah did not wish for the calamity that he prophesied against Judah. His heart was aligned with God's desire for repentance rather than judgment. This reflects the biblical principle that God does not delight in the destruction of the wicked but desires that all come to repentance (<a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>). Jeremiah's reluctance for the "day of despair" highlights his compassion and the heavy burden of delivering messages of impending doom, similar to the sorrow Jesus expressed over Jerusalem in <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>.<p><b>You know that the utterance of my lips was spoken in Your presence.</b><br>Jeremiah asserts that his prophecies were delivered with divine authority, spoken in the presence of God. This phrase emphasizes the authenticity and divine origin of his message, reinforcing the prophet's role as God's mouthpiece. The presence of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, signifying approval and empowerment, as seen in the commissioning of prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>) and the apostles in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Jeremiah's assurance that his words were spoken before God underscores the integrity and truth of his prophetic ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

The verse calls every believer to the same steadfast shepherding heart&#8212;serving, grieving, and speaking only under the gaze of the One who knows all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">I have not hastened . . .</span>--The words of the English Version are somewhat obscure, and a better rendering would perhaps be, <span class= "ital">I have not been quick to withdraw from my work in following thee, as a shepherd and guide of the people. </span>A possible meaning, adopted by some commentators, would be, "I have not hastened from my work as a shepherd (in the literal sense) to follow thee," as presenting a parallel to the words of Amos (<a href="/context/amos/7-14.htm" title="Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:">Amos 7:14-15</a>); and, though we cannot get beyond conjecture, it is quite possible that Jeremiah, in his youth, before the call of <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Jeremiah 1:4</a>, may have been employed in the pasture grounds that belonged to Anathoth as a city of the priests (<a href="/numbers/35-4.htm" title="And the suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.">Numbers 35:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-4.htm" title="And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.">Joshua 21:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-18.htm" title="Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.">Joshua 21:18</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-60.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin; Geba with her suburbs, and Alemeth with her suburbs, and Anathoth with her suburbs. All their cities throughout their families were thirteen cities.">1Chronicles 6:60</a>). It is to some extent in favour of this view, that throughout the book the work of the shepherd, when used figuratively, answers to the work of the ruler, and not to that of the prophet. What he means, if we keep the version given above, is that he had not been too slack in his obedience, but neither had he been over eager. He had no desire to see the woful day that would fulfil his predictions. What had come from his lips was just what he had been bidden to say and no more (<a href="/context/jeremiah/15-16.htm" title="Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.">Jeremiah 15:16-19</a>), and thus he had spoken as in the sight of God.

He is, as Hosea calls him (<a href="/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>, Hebrew), "the man of the Spirit." If God leads any one, whether people or individuals, it is through the agency of the Spirit (<a href="/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11, 12</a>); and it is the characteristic of the typical prophet that his ear is "wakened morning by morning" to receive his daily lesson.
