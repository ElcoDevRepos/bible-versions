In the biblical context, "the wise" often refers to those who are considered knowledgeable or learned in society, such as scribes or elders. However, their wisdom is deemed foolish when it contradicts God's truth. This theme is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>, where Paul questions the value of worldly wisdom compared to God's wisdom. The shame mentioned here is a result of their failure to recognize and submit to divine authority.<p><b>they will be dismayed and trapped.</b><br>The dismay and entrapment of the wise indicate the consequences of relying on human understanding rather than God's guidance. Historically, this can be seen in the downfall of Judah, as the leaders and people trusted in alliances and false prophets rather than heeding Jeremiah's warnings. The imagery of being "trapped" suggests a snare or a situation from which there is no escape, reflecting the inevitable judgment that comes from rejecting God's word. This is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>, where an evil man is ensnared by his own sin.<p><b>Since they have rejected the word of the LORD,</b><br>Rejection of God's word is a central theme in Jeremiah's prophecies. The people of Judah had turned away from the covenant and ignored the messages delivered by the prophets. This rejection is not merely intellectual but involves a willful disobedience and turning away from God's commands. In <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, the importance of choosing life by loving and obeying God is emphasized, contrasting with the rejection seen here. The rejection leads to spiritual blindness and moral decay.<p><b>what wisdom do they really have?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the futility of human wisdom apart from God. True wisdom is rooted in the fear of the Lord, as stated in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>. Without adherence to God's word, any claim to wisdom is hollow and ineffective. This is a call to recognize that genuine understanding and insight come from aligning with divine revelation. The question challenges the reader to evaluate the source of their own wisdom and to seek alignment with God's truth, as seen in <a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>, which describes the characteristics of heavenly wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
