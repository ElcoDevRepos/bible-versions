The reference serves as a powerful symbol of total devastation and divine retribution. The mention of "their neighbors" suggests that the judgment extended beyond just these two cities, affecting the surrounding region, which aligns with the biblical account of the cities of the plain. This comparison underscores the severity of the judgment prophesied against Edom, emphasizing that it will be as complete and irreversible as that of Sodom and Gomorrah.<p><b>says the LORD,</b><br>This phrase asserts divine authority over the prophecy, indicating that the message is not Jeremiah's own but is delivered on behalf of God. It reinforces the certainty and seriousness of the impending judgment. The use of "says the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that authenticates the message as coming directly from God, who is sovereign and just in His judgments.<p><b>no one will dwell there;</b><br>This phrase predicts the complete desolation of the land, similar to the aftermath of Sodom and Gomorrah's destruction. The absence of inhabitants signifies a total and lasting judgment, leaving the land uninhabitable. This desolation serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of persistent sin and rebellion against God. The imagery of an uninhabited land is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing divine judgment and abandonment.<p><b>no man will abide there.</b><br>Reiterating the previous phrase, this emphasizes the permanence of the desolation. The use of "abide" suggests not just living but dwelling in a settled, enduring manner. The prophecy indicates that the land will not only be temporarily deserted but will remain uninhabited indefinitely. This serves as a stark warning of the consequences of defying God, reinforcing the idea that divine judgment leads to irreversible ruin. The complete absence of human life highlights the severity of God's judgment and the fulfillment of His prophetic word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>Ancient cities mentioned in Genesis, known for their wickedness and subsequently destroyed by God as a judgment for their sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, often in conflict with Israel, and the subject of this prophecy of judgment in <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/49.htm">Jeremiah 49</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who speaks through the prophet Jeremiah, declaring His judgments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_neighbors_of_sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">The Neighbors of Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding cities that were also destroyed in the judgment described in Genesis.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Certainty of God's Judgment</a></b><br>Just as Sodom and Gomorrah were definitively destroyed, God's judgment on Edom is certain.
