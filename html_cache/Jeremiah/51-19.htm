"The Portion of Jacob" refers to God as the inheritance and possession of the people of Israel, highlighting a personal and covenantal relationship. Unlike the lifeless idols made by human hands, God is living and active. This distinction is emphasized throughout the Old Testament, where God is portrayed as unique and incomparable (<a href="/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18-20</a>). The term "Portion" signifies a deep, sustaining relationship, as seen in <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>, where God is described as the strength and portion forever.<p><b>for He is the Maker of all things</b><br>This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and creative power, setting Him apart from idols, which are created by humans. The assertion that God is the "Maker of all things" affirms His role as the Creator of the universe, a theme prevalent in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a> and reiterated in <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>. This creative authority establishes God's supremacy over all creation, including the nations and their gods, reinforcing His omnipotence and the futility of idol worship.<p><b>and of the tribe of His inheritance</b><br>This phrase refers to Israel as God's chosen people, His special possession among the nations. The concept of Israel as God's inheritance is rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>, where it is stated that "the LORD's portion is His people." This covenant relationship is central to Israel's identity and mission, as they are called to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers as God's inheritance, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>.<p><b>the LORD of Hosts is His name</b><br>This title emphasizes God's authority and command over the heavenly armies, signifying His power and ability to execute judgment and deliverance. "LORD of Hosts" is a frequent title in the prophetic books, illustrating God's might and His role as a divine warrior (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>). It assures Israel of God's protection and the certainty of His promises. This title also points to the ultimate victory of God over all spiritual and earthly powers, a theme fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who is described as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords in <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch whose name was later changed to Israel.
