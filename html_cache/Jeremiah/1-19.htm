Historically, Jeremiah's ministry occurred during a tumultuous period in Judah's history, including the reigns of several kings and the eventual Babylonian exile. The "they" refers to the leaders, priests, and people of Judah who resisted his messages of impending judgment. This opposition is a common theme for prophets, as seen with Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19:1-2</a>) and later with Jesus (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>).<p><b>but will never overcome you</b><br>Despite the fierce opposition, God assures Jeremiah of his protection. This promise of divine protection is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>, which speaks of no weapon prospering against God's servants. It highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His chosen messengers, ensuring that His purposes will prevail despite human resistance.<p><b>since I am with you to deliver you</b><br>God's presence with Jeremiah is a central theme, providing assurance and strength. This echoes God's promise to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a> and to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>, emphasizing that divine presence is a source of courage and deliverance. The concept of God being with His people is fulfilled ultimately in Jesus Christ, referred to as "Immanuel," meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and certainty of the message. The use of "declares the LORD" is a prophetic formula that authenticates the message as coming directly from God. It is a reminder of the divine origin of Jeremiah's calling and the assurance that God's word will accomplish what it intends, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
