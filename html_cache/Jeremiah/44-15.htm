The act of burning incense to other gods was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and a common practice in pagan worship. The men&#8217;s awareness of their wives&#8217; actions suggests a complicity or at least a passive acceptance of idolatry, reflecting a broader cultural and spiritual decline. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>, where Solomon's heart was turned away by his foreign wives to other gods.<p><b>and all the women standing by&#8212;a great assembly&#8212;</b><br>The mention of a "great assembly" of women indicates the widespread nature of the idolatrous practices. Women in ancient Near Eastern cultures often played significant roles in religious rituals, and their participation here underscores the depth of the community's departure from Yahweh. This assembly may also reflect the social structure where women, though often in domestic roles, could influence religious practices, as seen in the worship of the Queen of Heaven (<a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>).<p><b>along with all the people living in the land of Egypt and in Pathros</b><br>The reference to Egypt and Pathros (southern Egypt) situates this event geographically. Historically, after the fall of Jerusalem, some Jews fled to Egypt for refuge (<a href="/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7</a>). Pathros, known from Egyptian records, was a region where Jewish communities settled. This setting fulfills earlier warnings from God about the consequences of seeking refuge in Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19-22</a>), a land synonymous with bondage and idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>).<p><b>said to Jeremiah</b><br>Jeremiah, the prophet, served as God's mouthpiece, often delivering messages of judgment and calls for repentance. His presence in Egypt with the exiled Jews signifies his continued mission to guide and admonish them, despite their persistent rebellion. This interaction is part of a larger narrative where Jeremiah's prophecies often met with resistance and disbelief (<a href="/jeremiah/44-16.htm">Jeremiah 44:16-17</a>), reflecting the broader theme of prophetic rejection seen throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet of God who is delivering a message to the people of Judah living in Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_judah.htm">Men of Judah</a></b><br>These are the husbands who were aware of their wives' idolatrous practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/women_of_judah.htm">Women of Judah</a></b><br>The wives who were actively participating in burning incense to other gods.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the remnant of Judah had fled, seeking refuge from Babylonian conquest.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pathros.htm">Pathros</a></b><br>A region in Upper Egypt where some of the Judeans had settled.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is a recurring sin that leads to separation from God.
