The mention of "all the women" highlights their active role in the idolatrous practices condemned in this chapter. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, women often participated in domestic religious rituals, which could include the worship of foreign deities. This phrase underscores the communal responsibility for sin and the need for collective repentance.<p><b>Hear the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase is a common prophetic introduction, asserting the divine authority behind Jeremiah's message. It emphasizes that the words spoken are not merely human opinions but are the direct communication from Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. The call to "hear" implies not just listening but also obeying, a recurring theme in the prophetic literature where hearing is linked to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>all those of Judah who are in the land of Egypt</b><br>After the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, some Judeans fled to Egypt, seeking refuge from Babylonian oppression. This migration was against God's directive to remain in the land and submit to Babylonian rule (<a href="/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10-12</a>). Egypt, historically a place of bondage for Israel, symbolizes a return to old dependencies and a lack of trust in God's promises. The presence of Judeans in Egypt also reflects the broader historical context of political alliances and cultural exchanges between Judah and Egypt. This setting serves as a backdrop for Jeremiah's message, highlighting the consequences of disobedience and the futility of seeking security outside of God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

The phrase &#8220;word of the LORD&#8221; appears over 100 times in Jeremiah, underscoring that Scripture records God&#8217;s own speech (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>- Rejecting this word has already cost Judah its land; another refusal in Egypt will seal their fate (<a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all those of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.</b><p>- The remnant fled to Egypt for safety, directly disobeying God&#8217;s instruction to remain in the land (<a href="/jeremiah/42-13.htm">Jeremiah 42:13&#8211;19</a>).<p>- Egypt, the place of former slavery (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>), symbolizes a backward step of distrust in the Lord&#8217;s protection (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>- Jeremiah&#8217;s message warns that geography offers no refuge from divine judgment; faithfulness, not location, secures blessing (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/44-24.htm">Jeremiah 44:24</a> captures a prophet&#8217;s final plea to an exiled, stubborn people. He speaks with God-given authority to every member of the community, highlighting women because many had led in idolatrous practices. His call to &#8220;hear&#8221; confronts their misplaced trust in Egypt and summons wholehearted obedience. The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s word is universal in scope, uncompromising in authority, and eternally relevant: no one is beyond its reach, and no refuge&#8212;geographical, cultural, or personal&#8212;can shield us from its demands or its promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24-28) <span class= "bld">Hear the word of the Lord . . .</span>--The appeal to the experience of the past is followed by a prediction of the future, addressed to the wives as well as to the husbands. The new sin would lead to a new punishment. A tone of irony is perceptible in the words, "Ye will surely accomplish your vows." That, at all events, was a promise they were likely to keep, however faithless they might have shown themselves in keeping their vows to the God of their fathers. But the Lord of Israel meets that vow by another. By that "great name" (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:">Genesis 22:16</a>) of the Lord God (<span class= "ital">Jehovah Adonai</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which they had slighted and profaned, He declares that it shall be profaned no more by the Egyptian exiles, not because they, of their own accord, would cease to use it, but because none of them should be left there. The small remnant that survived the sword and the famine should return to Judah as a witness of the judgment that had fallen on them, and of the truth of the prophet's warning. The words of Jehovah should stand, while those of men should fail.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/44-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jeremiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1433;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;m&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3414.htm">Strong's 3414: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jeremiah -- 'Yah loosens', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
