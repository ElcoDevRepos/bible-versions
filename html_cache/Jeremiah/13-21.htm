Historically, Judah often sought political alliances with surrounding nations like Egypt and Babylon, contrary to God's command to rely solely on Him (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>). The irony is that these allies, whom Judah trusted and even influenced, would turn against them. This reflects a broader biblical theme of misplaced trust, as seen in <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>, which warns against putting trust in princes or mortal men. The phrase also highlights the sovereignty of God in using even foreign nations to accomplish His purposes, a theme prevalent throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>Will not pangs of anguish grip you,</b><br>The imagery of "pangs of anguish" is a common biblical metaphor for sudden and intense suffering, often used to describe the distress of a nation under divine judgment (<a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>, <a href="/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>). This metaphor evokes the idea of unavoidable and overwhelming pain, emphasizing the severity of the coming judgment. In the context of Jeremiah, it underscores the inevitability of the consequences of Judah's disobedience and idolatry. The use of such vivid imagery serves to awaken the people to the seriousness of their situation and the urgency of repentance.<p><b>as they do a woman in labor?</b><br>The comparison to a woman in labor is a powerful image of unavoidable and intense suffering that leads to a new reality. In biblical literature, labor pains often symbolize the birth of a new era or the coming of God's judgment (<a href="/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8</a>). This metaphor not only conveys the intensity of the suffering but also suggests a transformative process. For Judah, this transformation would involve the painful experience of exile and the eventual restoration. The labor imagery also points to the hope of redemption and renewal, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22-23</a>, where creation's groaning in labor pains anticipates the ultimate redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The rendering of the verse is uncertain, though the Authorized Version undoubtedly requires correction. The alternatives are, <span class="accented">What wilt thou say when he shall appoint over thee</span> (<span class="accented">but thou thyself hast trained them against thee</span>) <span class="accented">familiar friends as thy head? and</span>, <span class="accented">What wilt thou say when he shall appoint over thee those whom thou hast taught thy familiar friends as thy head?</span> The rendering "familiar friends" is justified by <a href="/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>; <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>. The "captains" of Authorized Version, or rather "tribal chiefs," is unsuitable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will you say</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He sets</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1465;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(yip&#772;&#183;q&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6485.htm">Strong's 6485: </a> </span><span class="str2">To visit, to oversee, muster, charge, care for, miss, deposit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">over you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;la&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
