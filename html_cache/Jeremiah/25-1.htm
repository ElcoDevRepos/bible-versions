His role was to communicate God's messages to the people of Judah. This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the message, underscoring the authority and authenticity of the prophecy. Jeremiah's prophetic ministry spanned over 40 years, during which he warned of impending judgment due to the people's persistent disobedience.<p><b>concerning all the people of Judah</b><br>The message was directed to the entire nation of Judah, highlighting the collective responsibility and the widespread nature of their sin. Judah, the southern kingdom, was the remnant of the once-united Israelite monarchy. The focus on "all the people" indicates that the prophecy was not just for the leaders but for every inhabitant, emphasizing the communal aspect of their covenant with God.<p><b>in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah</b><br>Jehoiakim's reign was marked by political instability and spiritual decline. He was a vassal king under Egyptian and later Babylonian control. His reign followed that of his father, Josiah, who was known for his religious reforms and attempts to return Judah to the worship of Yahweh. The fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign corresponds to 605 BC, a pivotal year in Judah's history.<p><b>which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's rise to power marked the beginning of Babylon's dominance in the ancient Near East. His first year as king was significant for Judah, as it signaled the start of Babylonian incursions into the region. This period was characterized by the fulfillment of earlier prophecies regarding Babylon as an instrument of God's judgment against Judah for their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns eventually led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile, a major theme in Jeremiah's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

It is the fourth (in <a href="/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.">Daniel 1:1</a>, the third) year of the reign of Jehoiakim, who had been made king by Pharaoh-nechoh after his defeat of Josiah and capture of Jerusalem. Since the prophet had been called to his work, B.C. 629, a great revolution had been brought about in the relations of the colossal monarchies of the East. Nineveh had fallen (B.C. 606) under the attacks of Cyaxares the Mede, and Nabopolassar the Chaldaean. Nebuchadnezzar, the son of the latter, though his father did not die till the following year, was practically clothed with supreme authority, and had defeated Pharaoh-nechoh at Carchemish, on the banks of the Euphrates, in B.C. 605. The form of the name used here, Nebuchadrezzar, corresponds with the Assyrian, <span class= "ital">Nabu-kudu-ur-uzur. </span>(<a href="/jeremiah/46-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;">Jeremiah 46:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-20.htm" title="After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.">2Chronicles 35:20</a>.) He was now the master of the East, and it was given to Jeremiah to discern the bearings of the new situation on the future destinies of Judah, and to see that the wisdom of its rulers would be to accept the position of tributary rulers under the great conqueror instead of rashly seeking either to assert their independence or to trust to the support of Egypt, crushed as she was by the defeat at Carchemish. The clear vision of the prophet saw in the Chaldaean king the servant of Jehovah--in modern phrase, the instrument of the designs of the Providence which orders the events of history--and he became, from that moment, the unwelcome preacher of the truth--that the independence of Judah had passed away, and that nothing but evil could follow from fanatical attempts, or secret intrigues and alliances, aiming at resistance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first year of Nebuchadnezzar</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>;
