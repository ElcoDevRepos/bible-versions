Their coming to fight signifies the impending invasion and siege of Jerusalem, which was a fulfillment of God's warning through the prophets. Historically, the Chaldeans were known for their military prowess and strategic conquests, which included the eventual destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. This phrase highlights the certainty of the threat and the fulfillment of divine prophecy as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>.<p><b>and to fill those places with the corpses of the men</b><br>This phrase underscores the severity of the coming judgment. The "places" refer to the streets and public areas of Jerusalem, which would be filled with the dead as a result of the siege. This imagery is a stark reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God. The mention of corpses also connects to the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25-26</a>, where disobedience leads to defeat and death.<p><b>I will strike down in My anger and in My wrath</b><br>God's anger and wrath are expressions of His righteous judgment against sin. This phrase emphasizes that the destruction is not merely a result of human conflict but is divinely ordained as a response to the persistent rebellion and idolatry of the people. Theologically, it reflects the holiness of God and His intolerance of sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a>.<p><b>I have hidden My face from this city</b><br>The hiding of God's face is a metaphor for the withdrawal of His favor and protection. In biblical terms, God's face represents His presence and blessing (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). The hiding of His face indicates a broken relationship due to the people's unfaithfulness. This concept is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, where sin creates a separation between God and His people.<p><b>because of all its wickedness</b><br>The wickedness of Jerusalem included idolatry, injustice, and the rejection of God's commandments. This phrase points to the moral and spiritual corruption that had permeated the society, leading to divine judgment. The prophets, including Jeremiah, repeatedly called out these sins (<a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30-31</a>), urging repentance.

Yet, in the wider context of <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/33.htm">Jeremiah 33</a>, the Lord will later promise restoration once repentance comes, proving that His ultimate purpose&#8212;even in wrath&#8212;is to purify and redeem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">They come to fight with the Chaldeans . . .</span>--The Hebrew construction is participial, and has the force expressed in English by "they" used indefinitely.

"They come" could only refer to the Jews, but these would rather be said to "go out;" the Hebrew writers are particular in distinguishing between to "come" and to "go out." Besides, there is no grammatical connection with the preceding verse.
