In the context of Jeremiah, the Israelites are facing consequences due to their own actions. The Bible often highlights the principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>), where individuals and nations face the outcomes of their choices. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>by forsaking the LORD your God</b><br>Forsaking God refers to the Israelites abandoning their covenant relationship with Yahweh. Historically, this involved turning to idolatry and alliances with foreign nations, contrary to God's commands (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The cultural context of the time included the worship of Baal and other deities, which was prevalent among neighboring nations. This spiritual adultery is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, symbolizing Israel's unfaithfulness (Hosea 1-3).<p><b>when He led you in the way</b><br>This phrase recalls God's guidance and provision during the Exodus and the journey to the Promised Land. It underscores God's faithfulness and the miraculous events that established Israel as a nation (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). The "way" can also be seen as a metaphor for the righteous path God set before them, which they were to follow. This guidance is a type of Christ, who later declares Himself as "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), offering spiritual direction and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Scripture affirms the same pattern throughout history: blessings attend obedience; consequences follow rebellion. The verse urges every reader to heed God&#8217;s guidance, cling to His covenant love, and avoid the bitter fruit of forsaking the Lord who alone leads us in the way.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Hast thou not procured this . . .?</span>--The secret cause of the calamities is brought to light.
