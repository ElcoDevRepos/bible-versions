The term "desolation" indicates complete destruction, leaving the city uninhabitable. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled during the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The "object of scorn" suggests that Jerusalem, once a city of great renown and the center of worship, would become a symbol of shame and derision among the nations. This reflects the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where disobedience leads to becoming a "byword among all nations."<p><b>All who pass by will be appalled and will scoff at all her wounds.</b><br>The imagery of passersby being "appalled" underscores the extent of the devastation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, cities were often judged by their strength and prosperity; thus, a ruined city would evoke shock and horror. The "scoffing" indicates mockery and disdain, suggesting that Jerusalem's downfall would be seen as a cautionary tale. The "wounds" symbolize the physical and spiritual afflictions suffered by the city, reminiscent of <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>, where Jerusalem's enemies mock her downfall. This also foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who bore the scorn and wounds of humanity, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.
