His reign is marked by a return to idolatry and oppression, reversing the reforms of his father Josiah. Jehoiakim's reign was characterized by political instability and subjugation to foreign powers, initially Egypt and later Babylon. His reign is significant in the prophetic ministry of Jeremiah, as it was during this time that Jeremiah's warnings of impending judgment became more urgent. Jehoiakim's rejection of Jeremiah's prophecies, including the burning of the scroll (Jeremiah 36), highlights the spiritual decline of Judah.<p><b>until the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah</b><br>Zedekiah, originally named Mattaniah, was the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile. He was appointed by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon after the deportation of Jehoiachin. Zedekiah's reign was marked by political turmoil and rebellion against Babylonian rule, despite Jeremiah's counsel to submit to Babylon as God's instrument of judgment. The "fifth month of the eleventh year" refers to the time when Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians in 586 BC, marking the end of Zedekiah's reign and the destruction of the city and the temple. This period is crucial in understanding the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecies and the transition to the Babylonian exile.<p><b>when the people of Jerusalem went into exile</b><br>The exile of the people of Jerusalem was a pivotal event in Jewish history, fulfilling the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah. This exile was not only a physical displacement but also a spiritual and cultural crisis for the people of Judah. It marked the beginning of the Babylonian captivity, a period of seventy years as prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>). Theologically, the exile served as a divine judgment for the nation's persistent idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. It also set the stage for future restoration and the coming of the Messiah, as the exilic and post-exilic periods saw a renewed focus on the law and the hope of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

By stating that &#8220;the word of the LORD came&#8230;through the days of Jehoiakim,&#8221; the verse underscores God&#8217;s persistence in speaking even when national leadership hardened its heart.<p>&#8226; This phrase quietly warns that a shift in earthly leadership never silences divine truth. God raised Jeremiah to confront Jehoiakim just as He had strengthened the prophet under Josiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah</b><p>&#8226; Zedekiah, Josiah&#8217;s youngest son, was installed by Nebuchadnezzar after Jehoiachin&#8217;s brief reign (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Jeremiah continued prophesying until &#8220;the fifth month of the eleventh year&#8221; of this king, marking August 586 BC.<p>&#8226; By stating the exact ending point, Scripture fixes Jeremiah&#8217;s public ministry firmly in history; the reliability of the prophetic word is tied to real dates and real kings (<a href="/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also shows God&#8217;s longsuffering. For roughly forty years&#8212;Josiah&#8217;s thirteenth year (627 BC) to Zedekiah&#8217;s eleventh (586 BC)&#8212;the Lord called Judah to repent (<a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3</a>). The clock of mercy kept ticking, yet the people would not listen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when the people of Jerusalem went into exile</b><p>&#8226; The final clause explains why the timeline stops: Jerusalem fell, and the surviving citizens were carried away (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8&#8211;12</a>). Jeremiah had forewarned this outcome (<a href="/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8&#8211;10</a>; 38:2).<p>&#8226; The exile validates Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecies and God&#8217;s covenant justice (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>). Judah&#8217;s broken relationship with the Lord resulted in broken walls and empty streets (<a href="/lamentations/1-3.htm">Lamentations 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the wording &#8220;went into exile&#8221; hints at hope; the same God who sent them out would gather them back (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10&#8211;14</a>).
