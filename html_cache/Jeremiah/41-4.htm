Gedaliah was appointed by the Babylonians as governor over the remnant in Judah after the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. His murder by Ishmael, a member of the royal family, was a significant political upheaval. This act of violence disrupted the fragile peace and order established by the Babylonians. The second day indicates that the news had not yet spread, highlighting the isolation and potential for further chaos.<p><b>when no one yet knew about it</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the secrecy and initial lack of awareness surrounding the assassination. The delay in the dissemination of this news reflects the communication challenges of the time, as well as the potential for further treachery and instability. It also sets the stage for the subsequent events, as the lack of knowledge among the people could lead to confusion and misguided actions. This secrecy can be seen as a metaphor for the hidden sins and treacheries that often go unnoticed until they manifest in larger consequences, a theme prevalent throughout the prophetic writings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gedaliah.htm">Gedaliah</a></b><br>Appointed by the Babylonians as governor over the remnant in Judah after the destruction of Jerusalem.
