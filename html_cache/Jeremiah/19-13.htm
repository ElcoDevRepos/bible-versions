The defilement of the houses signifies a loss of sanctity and divine favor. Topheth, located in the Valley of Hinnom, was a site associated with child sacrifice to the god Molech, making it a symbol of extreme idolatry and abomination. The defilement of the houses of Jerusalem and the royal houses suggests that the same abominations practiced in Topheth have permeated the city and its leadership, leading to inevitable judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's intolerance for idolatry and the consequences of turning away from Him.<p><b>all the houses on whose rooftops they burned incense to all the host of heaven</b><br>Burning incense on rooftops was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religions, often associated with worshiping celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars. This practice was explicitly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), as it constituted idolatry. The reference to "all the host of heaven" indicates a syncretism where the people of Judah adopted pagan practices, blending them with their worship of Yahweh. This act of idolatry on the rooftops, a place visible and open, underscores the blatant and public nature of their rebellion against God.<p><b>and poured out drink offerings to other gods.</b><br>Drink offerings were part of the sacrificial system in Israel, meant to honor Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>). However, here they are offered to "other gods," highlighting the people's apostasy. This act of pouring out drink offerings to idols represents a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and signifies a covenantal breach. The practice of offering to other gods was a recurring issue in Israel's history, leading to divine judgment and exile. This phrase serves as a reminder of the importance of exclusive devotion to God and the dangers of spiritual infidelity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

From the commoner&#8217;s cottage to the king&#8217;s palace, every residence that turned its rooftop into an idol altar will be treated as loathsome as Topheth. The verse underscores a timeless principle: when God&#8217;s people replace exclusive devotion with syncretistic worship&#8212;even within the privacy of their homes&#8212;defilement spreads, and divine justice follows swiftly and thoroughly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Defiled as the place of Tophet.--</span>A difficulty affecting the construction, but not the sense, of the passage, makes the rendering <span class= "ital">as the place of Tophet the defiled </span>preferable.<span class= "bld"><p>Upon whose roofs they have burned incense.</span>--The flat roofs of Eastern houses were used, as for exercise (<a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm" title="And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.">2Samuel 11:2</a>) so also, as in Peter's vision at Joppa (<a href="/acts/10-9.htm" title="On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:">Acts 10:9</a>), for prayer and meditation, and seem from <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm" title="And them that worship the host of heaven on the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;">Zephaniah 1:5</a> to have been specially chosen, as was natural, for worship addressed to the host of heaven. The two altars "on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz" (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>) were probably so situated. Where men had been wont to keep the holy days of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/nehemiah/8-16.htm" title="So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.">Nehemiah 8:16</a>) they had celebrated their idolatrous rites. (See <a href="/jeremiah/32-29.htm" title="And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 32:29</a>.) So Strabo (xvi. p. 1, 131) describes the Nabath?ans as worshipping the sun, and offering incense on an altar on the roof of their houses. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The houses of the kings of Judah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the palaces and other buildings which together made up the king's house (<a href="/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall he defiled as the place of Tophet</span>.
