The mention of Ephraim's moaning indicates a deep sense of repentance and sorrow for past sins. This reflects God's attentiveness to the cries of His people, emphasizing His readiness to listen and respond to genuine repentance. The imagery of moaning suggests a heartfelt lament, akin to the cries of the Israelites in Egypt, which God also heard and responded to.<p><b>You disciplined me severely, like an untrained calf:</b><br>The discipline mentioned here is a reference to the consequences of Israel's disobedience, including exile and suffering. The comparison to an untrained calf suggests stubbornness and a need for guidance and correction. In ancient agricultural societies, calves needed training to be useful, symbolizing Israel's need for spiritual guidance. This discipline is not punitive but corrective, aiming to bring about repentance and restoration, similar to the way a loving parent disciplines a child.<p><b>Restore me, that I may return:</b><br>This plea for restoration highlights the desire for reconciliation with God. The concept of returning is central to the theme of repentance in the Bible, where turning back to God is both a physical and spiritual act. The request for restoration implies a recognition of God's sovereignty and mercy, acknowledging that only He can bring about true renewal. This echoes the prodigal son's return in the New Testament, where restoration follows repentance.<p><b>for You are the LORD my God:</b><br>This declaration reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and His people. By acknowledging God as "the LORD," the speaker recognizes His authority and faithfulness. The use of "my God" indicates a personal relationship, emphasizing trust and reliance on God's character. This phrase connects to the first commandment, underscoring the importance of exclusive devotion to God. It also foreshadows the New Covenant promise of a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ, who restores and reconciles humanity to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used as a symbol for the ten tribes.

God is not distant; His ears are attentive (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>). The cry itself shows the first stirrings of repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/29-12.htm">Jeremiah 29:12&#8211;13</a>).
