In the prophetic books, such declarations often precede a pronouncement of judgment or a call to repentance. It underscores the seriousness of the message and the need for the audience to pay attention.<p><b>Inquire among the nations:</b><br>This suggests a call to look beyond Israel to the surrounding nations for comparison. It implies that the actions of Israel are so unprecedented that even pagan nations would find them shocking. This reflects the cultural context where nations were often compared to highlight Israel's unique relationship with God and their failure to uphold it.<p><b>Who has ever heard things like these?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the gravity and uniqueness of Israel's sin. It suggests that the behavior of Israel is unparalleled and astonishing, even to those outside the covenant community. This phrase serves to highlight the depth of Israel's apostasy and rebellion against God.<p><b>Virgin Israel has done a most terrible thing:</b><br>The term "Virgin Israel" is used ironically here. It traditionally signifies purity and a special, untainted relationship with God, akin to a bride. However, Israel's actions have defiled this status. The "most terrible thing" refers to their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness, which are seen as spiritual adultery. This connects to other scriptures where Israel is depicted as an unfaithful spouse (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>). The imagery also foreshadows the need for redemption and restoration, themes fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/virgin_israel.htm">Virgin Israel</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to the nation of Israel, emphasizing its initial purity and covenant relationship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding peoples and countries who are called to witness the unprecedented actions of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_terrible_thing.htm">The Terrible Thing</a></b><br>The idolatry and unfaithfulness of Israel, which is shocking even to the pagan nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_idolatry.htm">The Seriousness of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just a minor offense; it is a grave sin that breaks the covenant relationship with God.

The Lord Himself is stepping in to interpret Israel&#8217;s situation, the same Lord who spoke creation into existence (<a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>) and who still upholds everything by His word (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). Because Scripture is infallible, this introductory phrase carries the full weight of heaven&#8217;s authority; it demands the same obedient hearing that Moses expected in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>.<p>Key implications:<p>&#8226; The indictment is not Jeremiah&#8217;s personal frustration; it is God&#8217;s verdict.<p>&#8226; The covenant relationship puts Israel under direct divine inspection, paralleling <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>, &#8220;You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Inquire among the nations:</b><p>God invites the surrounding peoples to examine Israel&#8217;s conduct&#8212;a courtroom scene reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a> and <a href="/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1-2</a>.

The term heightens the tragedy: the one who was once chaste has broken faith. What is &#8220;most terrible&#8221; (literally &#8220;abominations&#8221;) becomes clearer in the surrounding passage: idolatry, injustice, and stubborn refusal to heed prophetic warning (<a href="/jeremiah/18-12.htm">Jeremiah 18:12, 15</a>).<p>Points to notice:<p>&#8226; The marital imagery anticipates later restoration promises (<a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3-4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16-60.htm">Ezekiel 16:60</a>), but for now it underscores guilt.<p>&#8226; The gravity of covenant violation matches New Testament language where the church is called a &#8220;pure virgin&#8221; for Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>); unfaithfulness is still treated with the utmost seriousness (<a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s shocking language aims to provoke repentance before judgment falls (<a href="/jeremiah/18-17.htm">Jeremiah 18:17</a>), revealing both His justice and His mercy (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/18-13.htm">Jeremiah 18:13</a> captures God&#8217;s stunned verdict on His covenant people: the Lord Himself speaks, summons the nations as witnesses, declares Israel&#8217;s sin unprecedented, and laments that His once-pure &#8220;virgin&#8221; has committed unspeakable wrong.

This passage is unusually obscure. Literally we must, it would seem, render, <span class="accented">Doth the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field</span> (or possibly, <span class="accented">cease to flow from the rock unto the field</span>)? This is explained as pointing a contrast to the infidelity of God's people. "The snow never leaves the summit of Lebanon; the waters which take their rise therein never dry up; but my people have forgotten the law of their being, the source of their prosperity." The rendering of the first clause is, however, grammatically dubious (there is no example of this construction of '<span class="accented">azabh</span>), and all the old versions point to (or at least favor) a reading, <span class="accented">Shaddai</span> (the Almighty) instead of <span class="accented">sadai</span> (the field). If we keep the text, we must explain "the rock of the field" on the analogy of "my mountain in the field" (<a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>), as meaning "the rock which commands a wide prospect over the open lowland country," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Mount Lebanon. <span class="cmt_word">The cold flowing waters</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the numerous "streams from Lebanon," referred to in <a href="/songs/4-15.htm">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That come from another place;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whoso sources are foreign. But as this does not suit the connection, it is better to take the Hebrew word (<span class="accented">zarim</span>), usually rendered "foreign," in the sense of "pressing or hurrying along," with Ewald, Graf, and virtually Henderson. It thus becomes descriptive of these streams "as contracted within narrow channels while descending through the gorges and defiles of the <span class="accented">rocks</span>." Camp.
