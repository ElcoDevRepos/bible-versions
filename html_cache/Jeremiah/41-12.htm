The gathering of "all their men" suggests a sense of urgency and unity in response to the threat posed by Ishmael. This reflects the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where leaders would rally their people for protection and justice. The mobilization of men for battle is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often seen in the context of defending the nation or upholding God's covenant.<p><b>and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah</b><br>Ishmael, identified as the son of Nethaniah, was a member of the royal family and had assassinated Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians. This act of treachery was not only a political maneuver but also a violation of the covenantal peace that Gedaliah had established. The pursuit of Ishmael by Johanan and his men underscores the importance of justice and the restoration of order. This event is part of the larger narrative of the Babylonian exile, where the remnant of Judah faced internal and external threats.<p><b>And they found him near the great pool in Gibeon</b><br>The "great pool in Gibeon" is a significant geographical location, known for its association with earlier biblical events, such as the battle between Joab and Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a>). Gibeon was a prominent city in the tribal territory of Benjamin, strategically located and historically significant. The mention of the pool suggests a place where people gathered, possibly for water or as a meeting point. This setting highlights the tension and drama of the encounter, as it was a place known for conflict resolution and confrontation. The pursuit and confrontation at Gibeon reflect the ongoing struggle for leadership and control in the aftermath of Jerusalem's fall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael_son_of_nethaniah.htm">Ishmael son of Nethaniah</a></b><br>A member of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, who assassinated Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/johanan_son_of_kareah.htm">Johanan son of Kareah</a></b><br>A military leader who opposed Ishmael and sought to rescue the captives taken by him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>A significant city in ancient Israel, known for its large pool, which served as the location where Johanan caught up with Ishmael.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gedaliah.htm">Gedaliah</a></b><br>The appointed governor of Judah by the Babylonians, whose assassination by Ishmael led to the events in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_pool_in_gibeon.htm">The Great Pool in Gibeon</a></b><br>A landmark in Gibeon where the confrontation between Johanan and Ishmael took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_ignoring_warnings.htm">The Consequences of Ignoring Warnings</a></b><br>Gedaliah's failure to heed Johanan's warning about Ishmael led to his assassination.
