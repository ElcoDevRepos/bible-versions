Historically, this is a significant moment as it marks a shift from God being the protector of Israel to becoming their adversary due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry. This is reminiscent of other instances in the Old Testament where God opposes His people when they turn away from Him, such as in the wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>). Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of covenant unfaithfulness and the consequences that follow.<p><b>with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm</b><br>The imagery of an "outstretched hand and a mighty arm" is often used in the Bible to describe God's power and might, particularly in delivering His people, as seen in the Exodus narrative (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). Here, however, it is used in the context of judgment rather than deliverance. This reversal highlights the severity of Judah's sin and the extent of God's righteous anger. It also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and ability to execute judgment.<p><b>with anger, fury, and great wrath</b><br>These terms collectively emphasize the intensity of God's response to Judah's rebellion. "Anger, fury, and great wrath" are expressions of God's holiness and justice in the face of sin. This triad of terms is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe God's judgment, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-28.htm">Deuteronomy 29:28</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/5-15.htm">Ezekiel 5:15</a>. The repetition and escalation of these terms serve to communicate the depth of God's displeasure and the seriousness of the impending judgment. This passage foreshadows the eventual destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile, which were direct consequences of the nation's persistent sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The emphatic &#8220;I Myself&#8221; underscores that this is not delegated judgment; God personally steps onto the battlefield (<a href="/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments include <a href="/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>, where God says, &#8220;I looked, but there was no one to help&#8230; so My own arm brought Me salvation.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds Judah&#8212;and us&#8212;that the covenant Lord who once fought for them (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>) can just as literally fight against them when they persist in rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will fight against you</b><p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;fight&#8221; pictures open combat. The covenant people had assumed God was automatically on their side (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>), yet their unrepentant sin turned Him from Defender to Opponent.<p>&#8226; This reversal echoes <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>, &#8220;I will set My face against you, and you will be defeated by your enemies.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s warfare language is never metaphorical hype; He actually employs real nations, armies, and events&#8212;here, Babylon&#8212;to execute His verdict (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with an outstretched hand</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Outstretched hand&#8221; recalls the Exodus, where God delivered Israel &#8220;with an outstretched arm&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The identical imagery shows that the same literal power that once rescued now judges. <a href="/ezekiel/20-33.htm">Ezekiel 20:33&#8211;34</a> likewise pairs the phrase with both discipline and eventual restoration.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s hand is decisive; no counter-strategy can pry open His grip when He stretches it out in judgment (<a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a mighty arm</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Mighty arm&#8221; stresses strength that cannot be resisted (<a href="/psalms/89-13.htm">Psalm 89:13</a>, &#8220;You have a mighty arm; strong is Your hand&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The arm of the LORD is not shortened by wavering political alliances or military calculations (<a href="/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s walls, weapons, and treaties would collapse because the true combatant was the Almighty Himself (<a href="/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with anger, fury, and great wrath</b><p>&#8226; Three escalating nouns communicate intensity. <a href="/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a> uses the same trio to describe fire that &#8220;will not be quenched.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s anger is righteous, not capricious. He had warned for generations (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15&#8211;16</a>), yet the people still chose idolatry, injustice, and hardened hearts.<p>&#8226; <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a> affirm that divine wrath is consistent throughout Scripture, culminating in Christ&#8217;s future judgment on unrepentant nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/21-5.htm">Jeremiah 21:5</a> paints a sobering picture: the covenant Lord personally enters the fray against His own wayward people, wielding the same mighty hand and arm that once saved them, now charged with righteous wrath. The verse literally promises that if rebellion persists, God Himself becomes the adversary&#8212;an opponent no army can withstand. Yet the backdrop of Exodus imagery also whispers hope: the hand that judges is able to save all who humble themselves, turn from sin, and trust His covenant mercy ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/21-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I Myself</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will fight</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nil&#183;&#7717;am&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
