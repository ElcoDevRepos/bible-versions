In biblical times, turning one's back was a sign of disrespect and disobedience. This imagery is used to convey the people's intentional choice to ignore God, despite His continuous presence and guidance. The act of turning away from God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where the Israelites are described as a rebellious nation. This turning away is not just physical but spiritual, indicating a heart hardened against God&#8217;s commands and love.<p><b>Though I taught them again and again,</b><br>God's persistent efforts to teach His people reflect His patience and desire for their repentance. The phrase "again and again" underscores the repeated opportunities God provided for correction and instruction. This is consistent with the character of God as seen throughout the Bible, where He sends prophets and leaders to guide His people back to righteousness. In <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, the importance of teaching and remembering God's laws is emphasized, showing that God&#8217;s instructions were meant to be a constant part of life. The historical context reveals that prophets like Jeremiah were sent repeatedly to call the people back to God, yet they were often ignored or persecuted.<p><b>they would not listen or respond to discipline.</b><br>The refusal to listen or respond indicates a stubbornness and unwillingness to change, despite the consequences. This reflects the broader theme of Israel's history, where the people often failed to heed warnings and suffered as a result. <a href="/proverbs/12.htm">Proverbs 12:1 and 15</a>:32 highlight the folly of rejecting discipline, which is meant to correct and guide. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on wisdom and learning from correction, yet the people of Judah chose to ignore this. This phrase also foreshadows the coming judgment and exile, as their persistent disobedience leads to severe consequences. The lack of response to discipline can be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies perfect obedience and submission to the Father, contrasting with the disobedience of the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Like a child swiveling away from a parent&#8217;s embrace, Judah chose idols over the living God (<a href="/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>). Turning the back ends dialogue; it announces, &#8220;I&#8217;m done listening.&#8221; God&#8217;s covenant love was constant, yet their posture shouted indifference.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And not their faces</b><p>Throughout the Bible, seeking God&#8217;s face means open fellowship&#8212;<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a> speaks of His face shining on us. <a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a> urges, &#8220;Your face, Lord, I will seek.&#8221; By refusing to face Him, Judah forfeited the blessing promised to any nation that humbly turns to the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The tragedy is relational: God longs for eye-to-eye communion, but they looked elsewhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though I taught them again and again</b><p>The Lord&#8217;s instruction wasn&#8217;t occasional; He &#8220;rose up early&#8221; sending prophets daily (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>). <a href="/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a> describes His patient, repetitive teaching: &#8220;precept upon precept&#8230; line upon line.&#8221; Repetition underscores mercy&#8212;God never gives up easily. Every warning offered another chance to repent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They would not listen</b><p>Rebellion hardened into selective deafness. <a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a> laments, &#8220;Their ears are closed so they cannot hear.&#8221; Stephen later charged the Sanhedrin with the same resistance (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>). Hearing God&#8217;s word without heeding it deadens conscience and invites judgment; their refusal made exile inevitable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or respond to discipline</b><p>Discipline is love in action (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>). Instead of repenting under corrective blows&#8212;crop failures, foreign threats, prophetic rebukes&#8212;Judah stiffened. <a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a> pictures a bruised body refusing medical care. Ignoring discipline robbed them of restoration and magnified their guilt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/32-33.htm">Jeremiah 32:33</a> sketches a heartbreaking cycle: God offers relationship, instruction, and corrective love; the people answer with turned backs, deaf ears, and stubborn hearts. The verse warns that ongoing refusal to face God invites severe consequences, yet it also testifies to His relentless patience&#8212;He keeps teaching &#8220;again and again.&#8221; The path to restoration, then and now, is simple: turn the face back toward the Father, listen, and embrace His loving discipline.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">They have turned unto me the back . . .--</span>It will be remembered that this image was more or less a favourite one with the prophet.
