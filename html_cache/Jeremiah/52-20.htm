These pillars were not only architectural marvels but also symbolized strength and stability. Their destruction by the Babylonians marked the end of an era and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/27-19.htm">Jeremiah 27:19-22</a>).<p><b>the Sea</b><br>The "Sea" was a large bronze basin used for ceremonial washing by the priests (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>). It symbolized purity and the cleansing necessary for approaching God. Its destruction signifies the loss of ritual purity and the interruption of temple worship, foreshadowing the need for a new covenant.<p><b>the twelve bronze bulls under it</b><br>These bulls supported the Sea and represented the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/7-25.htm">1 Kings 7:25</a>). Their presence under the Sea highlighted the unity and support of the tribes for the priestly functions. The removal of these bulls symbolizes the disintegration of Israel's unity and the scattering of the tribes.<p><b>and the movable stands</b><br>The movable stands, or carts, were used to hold basins for washing (<a href="/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27-39</a>). They were intricately designed and demonstrated the craftsmanship of Solomon's era. Their destruction reflects the loss of Israel's cultural and religious heritage.<p><b>that King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD</b><br>King Solomon's construction of the temple was a fulfillment of God's promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The temple was the center of Israel's worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. Its desecration and the removal of its treasures were a profound spiritual and national tragedy.<p><b>the weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure</b><br>The immense quantity of bronze used signifies the wealth and glory of Solomon's reign. The phrase "beyond measure" emphasizes the loss of this wealth and the futility of relying on material splendor for security. It also points to the fulfillment of prophecy regarding the temple's destruction (<a href="/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17-19</a>).<br><br>This passage serves as a somber reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God and the transient nature of earthly glory. It also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who would establish a new temple not made with hands (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), offering a permanent and perfect means of worship and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet who warned Judah of impending judgment due to their disobedience to God.

By mentioning them here, Jeremiah underscores how even these proud emblems were carted off by Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>), proving no earthly structure can save a nation bent on rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Sea</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;Sea&#8221; was a fifteen-foot-wide basin holding about 11,000 gallons of water for priestly purification (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>; 2 Chron 4:2-6).<p>&#8226; Water for cleansing pointed to God&#8217;s holiness and the continual need for atonement (<a href="/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Its removal signals that Judah&#8217;s unrepentant sin had rendered the nation ceremonially unclean; the very instrument of cleansing is itself judged.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the twelve bronze bulls under it</b><p>&#8226; Twelve oxen, facing the four points of the compass in sets of three, upheld the Sea (<a href="/1_kings/7-25.htm">1 Kings 7:25</a>).<p>&#8226; They represented the twelve tribes supported by God&#8217;s strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>).<p>&#8226;

Nebuchadnezzar melted it down for profit (<a href="/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17, 20</a>), yet no conqueror can quantify what covenant rebellion truly costs (<a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a> piles up temple treasures to drive home one truth: when a people dismiss God&#8217;s Word, even the grandest symbols of faith collapse. The pillars, Sea, bulls, and stands once proclaimed divine strength, cleansing, unity, and heavenly glory, but Judah&#8217;s sin emptied them of meaning. Their immeasurable bronze now smolders in Babylonian furnaces, and the nation that once stood secure is exiled. The verse warns every generation that true security lies not in religious artifacts but in steadfast obedience to the Lord who once filled His house with glory and longs to restore it in hearts that honor Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;na&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - md<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pillars,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;
