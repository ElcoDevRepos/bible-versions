The officials mentioned are likely high-ranking members of the king's administration, possibly including princes or advisors. The courtyard is a significant location, often used for official business and royal decrees. This setting underscores the gravity of the situation, as the officials are bringing a matter of great importance to the king's attention. The act of going to the king suggests a formal and urgent communication, reflecting the seriousness of the message contained in the scroll.<p><b>And having stored the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe,</b><br>Elishama the scribe is a key figure here, likely serving as a royal secretary or record keeper. The chamber of Elishama would have been a secure place for storing important documents, indicating the scroll's significance. This action of storing the scroll suggests a need to protect and preserve the message, possibly due to its controversial or sensitive content. The role of scribes in ancient Judah was crucial, as they were responsible for recording and maintaining official documents. This detail highlights the organized and bureaucratic nature of the Judean court.<p><b>they reported everything to the king.</b><br>The officials' report to the king signifies the transmission of critical information. This act of reporting is a formal procedure, emphasizing the chain of command and the respect for authority within the royal court. The phrase "everything" suggests a comprehensive account, indicating that the officials did not withhold any details from the king. This transparency is crucial, as it allows the king to make informed decisions. The context of this report is the prophetic message from Jeremiah, which warned of impending judgment due to the nation's disobedience. This moment is pivotal, as it tests the king's response to divine warning, reflecting themes of accountability and the consequences of ignoring God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Refers to King Jehoiakim of Judah, who was ruling during the time of Jeremiah's prophetic ministry.

Their caution is justified; Jehoiakim will soon cut up and burn that very scroll (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment parallels how Baruch earlier read the scroll in the temple (<a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>), emphasizing the continuity of preserving and proclaiming divine revelation.<p>&#8226; It illustrates stewardship: God&#8217;s word is not merely to be proclaimed; it must also be protected, as seen when Jehoshaphat&#8217;s priests taught from the Book of the Law (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-9.htm">2 Chronicles 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They reported everything to the king</b><p>&#8226; The officials give the king a full account&#8212;&#8220;everything&#8221;&#8212;showing integrity in relaying God&#8217;s message without omission (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/3-18.htm">1 Samuel 3:18</a>, where Samuel tells Eli &#8220;everything and hid nothing&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Their report establishes judicial knowledge; once the king hears, he is morally responsible (<a href="/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Though they do not yet read the scroll aloud, their summary prepares Jehoiakim for direct confrontation with the written word, reflecting the pattern that &#8220;faith comes by hearing&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows two divergent responses: the officials&#8217; reverent handling versus the king&#8217;s impending rebellion, echoing contrasting receptions in <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11&#8211;13</a> (Bereans vs. Thessalonian agitators).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/36-20.htm">Jeremiah 36:20</a> records a pivotal transfer: the officials move from hearing to acting, from private deliberation to royal disclosure. By securing the scroll, approaching the king, and accurately reporting its contents, they model respect for God&#8217;s unbreakable word and place Jehoiakim under its authority. The verse underscores the twin responsibilities of safeguarding and declaring Scripture, setting the stage for the king&#8217;s fateful response and reminding modern readers that divine truth must be preserved intact and presented courageously, whatever the cost.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">They laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama . . .</span>--The step was a material one, from the official standpoint.
