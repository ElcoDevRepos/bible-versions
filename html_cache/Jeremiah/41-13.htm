Ishmael had recently assassinated Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians, and taken captives from Mizpah. The people with Ishmael were likely a mix of his followers and those he had taken captive, including soldiers, women, children, and court officials. This event occurs during a tumultuous period following the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, when Judah was under Babylonian control.<p><b>saw Johanan son of Kareah</b><br>Johanan, son of Kareah, was a military leader who opposed Ishmael's actions. He had warned Gedaliah about Ishmael's intentions but was not heeded. After the assassination, Johanan pursued Ishmael to rescue the captives. Johanan represents a remnant of the Judean leadership trying to stabilize the region after the Babylonian conquest. His actions are seen as an attempt to restore order and protect the people from further harm.<p><b>and all the commanders of the army with him</b><br>This indicates that Johanan was not acting alone but had the support of other military leaders. These commanders were likely part of the remaining Judean forces that had not been exiled or killed by the Babylonians. Their presence suggests a coordinated effort to counteract Ishmael's rebellion and protect the remaining population of Judah. This reflects the fragmented state of Judah's leadership and military after the fall of Jerusalem.<p><b>they rejoiced</b><br>The people's rejoicing upon seeing Johanan and his commanders suggests relief and hope for deliverance from Ishmael's oppressive control. This reaction highlights the desperation and fear experienced by the captives under Ishmael. The joy also signifies a turning point, as Johanan's intervention offers a chance for stability and safety. This moment can be seen as a foreshadowing of God's deliverance and protection for His people, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>A member of the royal family and one of the officers of the king, who had assassinated Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/johanan_son_of_kareah.htm">Johanan son of Kareah</a></b><br>A military leader who opposed Ishmael and sought to rescue the people Ishmael had taken captive.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_with_ishmael.htm">The People with Ishmael</a></b><br>These were the captives taken by Ishmael after he killed Gedaliah.
