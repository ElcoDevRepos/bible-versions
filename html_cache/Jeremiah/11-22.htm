This title underscores God's sovereignty and His ability to execute judgment. It is a reminder of the divine authority behind the message, similar to other prophetic declarations found throughout the Old Testament, such as in Isaiah and Amos.<p><b>I will punish them:</b><br>The context here is God's response to the covenant unfaithfulness of the people of Judah. The punishment is a direct consequence of their idolatry and rebellion against God's commands. This reflects the covenantal relationship where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The punishment is not arbitrary but a fulfillment of the warnings given through the Law and the prophets.<p><b>Their young men will die by the sword:</b><br>This phrase indicates a specific form of judgment&#8212;military defeat. Historically, this aligns with the Babylonian invasions that led to the fall of Jerusalem. The loss of young men in battle would have been devastating, as they represented the strength and future of the community. This echoes similar judgments found in other prophetic books, such as Ezekiel and Habakkuk, where military defeat is a consequence of national sin.<p><b>their sons and daughters by famine:</b><br>Famine is a recurring theme in biblical judgment, often resulting from siege warfare, as seen in the Babylonian conquest. The mention of sons and daughters highlights the comprehensive nature of the judgment, affecting all generations. This reflects the curses for disobedience in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where famine is a consequence of turning away from God. It also serves as a stark contrast to the blessings of provision promised for obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.

Earlier in the chapter, Judah is reminded of the Sinai covenant they swore to keep (<a href="/jeremiah/11-2.htm">Jeremiah 11:2&#8211;4</a>).
