It indicates a personal lament, reflecting Baruch's own words and feelings. Baruch was a faithful companion to Jeremiah, often writing down the prophet's messages. His role as a scribe was crucial in preserving the prophetic words, and this introduction highlights the personal nature of his complaint.<p><b>&#8216;Woe is me because the LORD has added sorrow to my pain!</b><br>Baruch expresses a deep sense of despair and suffering. The phrase "Woe is me" is a common biblical expression of lamentation, found in other scriptures such as <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a> and <a href="/lamentations/3.htm">Lamentations 3:1</a>. The mention of the LORD adding sorrow suggests a recognition of divine sovereignty over his circumstances. This reflects the broader theme in Jeremiah of God's judgment and the resulting suffering, which is a consequence of the people's disobedience. Baruch's lament can be seen as a microcosm of the larger national distress.<p><b>I am worn out with groaning</b><br>This phrase conveys Baruch's exhaustion and the depth of his emotional and physical fatigue. The Hebrew word for "groaning" often implies a deep, guttural expression of distress, similar to the groans of the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>). This connection underscores the severity of Baruch's situation, likening it to the suffering of the Israelites under bondage.<p><b>and have found no rest.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The lack of rest signifies a state of ongoing turmoil and unrest. In the biblical context, rest is often associated with peace and divine blessing, as seen in the promised rest in the land of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9-10</a>). Baruch's inability to find rest highlights the absence of peace in his life, mirroring the broader unrest in Judah due to impending Babylonian conquest. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate rest found in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>, where Jesus invites the weary to find rest in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>The scribe and faithful companion of the prophet Jeremiah. He is the one lamenting in this verse, expressing his personal distress and the burden of his role.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah. He is the one who recorded Baruch's lament and provided God's response to him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment and destruction due to their disobedience to God. The context of Baruch's lament is set against the backdrop of Judah's turmoil.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The event looming over Judah during this time, as Babylon was set to conquer and exile the people. This historical context adds weight to Baruch's lament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is sovereign over the events unfolding in Judah and who responds to Baruch's lament through Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_human_frailty.htm">Acknowledging Human Frailty</a></b><br>Baruch's lament reminds us of our human limitations and the importance of bringing our burdens to God.

Trusting in God's sovereignty can bring comfort even when circumstances are dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/finding_rest_in_god.htm">Finding Rest in God</a></b><br>True rest is found not in the absence of trouble but in the presence of God.

This personal address reminds us that our private laments are never lost in the wind; they reach the throne room, just as Hannah&#8217;s silent prayer did (<a href="/1_samuel/1-13.htm">1 Samuel 1:13</a>). The verse sets up a tender exchange: Baruch has spoken honestly, and now God will answer just as personally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Woe is me</b><p>Baruch exclaims, &#8220;Woe is me,&#8221; echoing other saints who felt overwhelmed&#8212;Isaiah cried, &#8220;Woe is me, for I am ruined!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>), and Micah lamented, &#8220;Woe is me! For I am like those who gather summer fruit&#8221; (<a href="/micah/7-1.htm">Micah 7:1</a>). Such cries do not disqualify a believer; they mark genuine faith wrestling with pain. Scripture shows that godly people can feel deep discouragement (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8-9</a>), yet the cry of &#8220;woe&#8221; turns them toward God rather than away from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the LORD has added sorrow to my pain</b><p>Baruch feels that God Himself has increased the weight he carries. Job voiced the same tension: &#8220;He multiplies my wounds without cause&#8221; (<a href="/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>). <a href="/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37-38</a> reminds us that both well-being and calamity come by the sovereign decree of God. For Baruch, the extra &#8220;sorrow&#8221; included the rejection of Jeremiah&#8217;s message, the destruction looming over Judah, and the personal cost of faithful ministry. The verse affirms that God&#8217;s hand is behind every circumstance&#8212;never capricious, always purposeful (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am worn out with groaning</b><p>The admission sounds like David&#8217;s: &#8220;I am weary with my groaning; every night I flood my bed with tears&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>). Physical fatigue, emotional depletion, and spiritual heaviness often converge in seasons of prolonged trial. Paul later confessed, &#8220;We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>). Scripture normalizes this exhaustion while also steering us to the One who &#8220;gives strength to the weary&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have found no rest</b><p>Baruch&#8217;s sleepless anguish mirrors Jeremiah&#8217;s own lament, &#8220;I have been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-17.htm">Lamentations 3:17</a>). Israel&#8217;s exile would soon make &#8220;no rest&#8221; a national experience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>). Yet God&#8217;s unfolding plan always holds a future rest: &#8220;My soul finds rest in God alone&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/62-1.htm">Psalm 62:1</a>) and &#8220;Come to Me&#8230;and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). Baruch&#8217;s restless night sets the stage for the Lord&#8217;s promise in the next verses&#8212;preservation amid judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/45-3.htm">Jeremiah 45:3</a> captures Baruch&#8217;s raw confession: he feels crushed, sorrow-laden, exhausted, and restless. God records these words to show that He hears honest lament, affirms His sovereign purpose even in added sorrow, understands the weariness of faithful servants, and prepares to speak comfort. The verse invites believers to bring every burden to the Lord, trusting that the One who notes each groan will also supply sustaining grace and ultimate rest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath added grief to my sorrow.</span> Baruch felt "sorrow" or "pain" at the sinfulness of the people;
