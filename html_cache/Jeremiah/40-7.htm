The "commanders and men of the armies" refer to the remnants of Judah's military forces who had survived the siege and were scattered in the countryside. The phrase suggests a network of communication among these groups, highlighting the importance of leadership and organization even in times of defeat. Historically, these commanders would have been guerilla leaders or local militia heads who managed to evade capture by the Babylonians.<p><b>that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land</b><br>Gedaliah's appointment by the Babylonian king, likely Nebuchadnezzar, signifies a shift in governance from a Davidic monarchy to a Babylonian-controlled administration. Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, was chosen due to his family's pro-Babylonian stance and his father's previous support of the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>). This appointment was meant to stabilize the region and ensure loyalty to Babylon. Gedaliah's role as governor was a political strategy to maintain order and prevent further rebellion.<p><b>and that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children who were the poorest of the land</b><br>This phrase highlights the social and economic conditions post-exile. The "poorest of the land" refers to those left behind after the Babylonian deportations, primarily the lower classes who were not deemed a threat or valuable to the Babylonian empire. This demographic shift left a remnant population that was vulnerable and in need of leadership. Gedaliah's charge over them was intended to provide stability and governance, ensuring that the land remained productive and loyal to Babylon.<p><b>and had not been exiled to Babylon</b><br>The mention of those "who had not been exiled" underscores the selective nature of the Babylonian deportations, which primarily targeted the elite, skilled workers, and leaders of society. This left behind a population that was less likely to rebel and more focused on survival. Theologically, this remnant concept is significant in the biblical narrative, as it often represents hope and the potential for renewal. The idea of a faithful remnant is echoed throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a> and <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, symbolizing God's ongoing covenant with His people despite judgment and exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/commanders_of_the_armies.htm">Commanders of the Armies</a></b><br>These were leaders of the remaining military forces in Judah after the Babylonian conquest.
