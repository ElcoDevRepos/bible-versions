The LORD, the covenant name of God, emphasizes His relationship with Israel. The phrase "the God of Israel" underscores His unique covenant with the nation, reminding them of their identity and obligations. This introduction is typical of prophetic declarations, asserting divine origin and authority, similar to other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>&#8216;Every wineskin shall be filled with wine.&#8217;</b><br>This statement uses a common cultural image. In ancient times, wineskins were made from animal hides and used to store wine. The filling of wineskins with wine is a natural expectation, symbolizing abundance and prosperity. However, in the context of Jeremiah, it is a metaphor for judgment. The wineskins represent the people of Judah, and the wine symbolizes the wrath of God that will fill them. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, where the cup of God's wrath is a metaphor for judgment.<p><b>And when they reply, &#8216;Don&#8217;t we surely know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?&#8217;</b><br>The people's response indicates their familiarity with the metaphor but also their misunderstanding of its significance. They acknowledge the obvious truth of the statement but fail to grasp its deeper meaning. This reflects the spiritual blindness and complacency of Judah, a recurring theme in Jeremiah. Their response is reminiscent of the scoffing attitude found in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>, where people question the coming judgment. The rhetorical question highlights their ignorance and sets the stage for the unfolding of God's message of impending judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The "bottle" in this case is not the "skin" commonly used for that purpose, but the earthen jar or flagon, the "potter's vessel" of <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm" title="And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water with out of the pit.">Isaiah 30:14</a>, the "pitcher" of <a href="/lamentations/4-2.htm" title="The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!">Lamentations 4:2</a>.

The prophet is bidden to go and proclaim to the people a dark saying, which in its literal sense would seem to them the idlest of all truisms.
