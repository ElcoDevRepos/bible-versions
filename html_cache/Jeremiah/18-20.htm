In biblical context, repaying good with evil is condemned (<a href="/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a>). It reflects the broader theme of human ingratitude and betrayal, seen throughout Scripture, such as in the life of David (<a href="/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17</a>). This question underscores the moral and ethical expectations God has for His people.<p><b>Yet they have dug a pit for me.</b><br>The imagery of digging a pit is a metaphor for plotting harm or betrayal, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It evokes the idea of setting a trap, as seen in <a href="/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>. This phrase indicates the severity of the opposition Jeremiah faces from his own people, who should have been his allies. It also foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who was betrayed by those He came to save.<p><b>Remember how I stood before You to speak good on their behalf,</b><br>Jeremiah reminds God of his intercessory role, similar to Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). This reflects the prophet's deep compassion and commitment to his people, despite their rebellion. It highlights the role of a prophet as an intermediary between God and man, a type of Christ who intercedes for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>to turn Your wrath from them.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the theme of divine judgment and mercy. Jeremiah's intercession aimed to avert God's wrath, akin to the role of Christ as the ultimate mediator who turns away God's wrath through His sacrifice (1 <a href="/john/2-2.htm">John 2:2</a>). It underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance to avoid divine judgment, a consistent biblical message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Scripture assumes that good should be met with gratitude (<a href="/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-12.htm">Psalm 35:12</a>).<p>&#8226; David raised a similar protest when Saul hunted him after receiving mercy (<a href="/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord calls His people to overcome evil with good (<a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>), making Judah&#8217;s hostility toward Jeremiah not only personally painful but covenant-breaking.<p>&#8226; In light of God&#8217;s moral order, Jeremiah&#8217;s question exposes sin, preparing the ground for divine judgment if unrepented.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yet they have dug a pit for me.</b><p>The imagery turns from moral reasoning to lethal reality.<p>&#8226; &#8220;They spread a net for my feet&#8230;they dug a pit before me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>) mirrors Jeremiah&#8217;s experience.<p>&#8226; A pit suggests premeditated, hidden violence&#8212;echoing earlier plots against the prophet (<a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: the prophet offers life-giving words (<a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2-3</a>), while the people engineer his death.<p>&#8226; Such betrayal fulfills warnings that rejecting God&#8217;s word leads to attacking His messenger (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Remember how I stood before You to speak good on their behalf, to turn Your wrath from them.</b><p>Jeremiah reminds the Lord of his intercessory role.<p>&#8226; Like Moses pleading for Israel after the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and Samuel praying during Philistine oppression (<a href="/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8-9</a>), Jeremiah &#8220;stood before&#8221; God for the nation (<a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His petitions aimed to &#8220;turn Your wrath,&#8221; foreshadowing the ultimate Mediator who would intercede even from the cross (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s appeal underscores the tragedy: the very one shielding the people from judgment becomes their target.<p>&#8226; This also affirms God&#8217;s willingness to relent when confronted with sincere intercession (<a href="/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/18-20.htm">Jeremiah 18:20</a> captures a heartbroken servant who:<p>1.

Appeals to God&#8217;s memory of his faithful intercession, highlighting the irony that those he sought to save now seek his life.<p>The verse calls believers to honor God&#8217;s messengers, trust His justice when righteousness is mistreated, and continue interceding for others even when that love is not returned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">They have digged a pit for my soul.</span>--The image has become so familiar that we have all but lost its vividness. What it meant here (as in <a href="/psalms/57-6.htm" title="They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have dig a pit before me, into the middle whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.">Psalm 57:6</a>) was that the man was treated as a beast, the prophet who sought their good as the wolf or the jackal whom they entrapped and slew.<p><span class= "bld">Remember that I stood before </span>thee.--The phrase is used frequently, though not uniformly, of the act of worship, of the communion of the soul with God (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/7-10.htm" title="And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?">Jeremiah 7:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-17.htm" title="Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm" title="You stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,">Deuteronomy 29:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm" title="And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before the LORD.

The prophet refers to his repeated though fruitless entreaties for the people in Jeremiah 14, 15. It is interesting to note the description of Jeremiah, in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-14.htm" title="Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of the brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, to wit, Jeremias the prophet of God.">2 Maccabees 15:14</a>, as "a lover of the brethren who prayeth much for the people and the holy city." Men had come to recognise that the spirit of intercession had been the prophet's dominant characteristic. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/18-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Should good</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be repaid</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;&#353;ul&#183;lam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7999.htm">Strong's 7999: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be safe, to be, completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8478.htm">Strong's 8478: </a> </span><span class="str2">The bottom, below, in lieu of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">evil?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Yet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they have dug</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1512;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3738.htm">Strong's 3738: </a> </span><span class="str2">To dig, to plot, to bore, open</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a pit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7745.htm">Strong's 7745: </a> </span><span class="str2">A chasm</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for me.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;nap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
