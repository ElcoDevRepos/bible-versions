Historically, the Israelites had a pattern of disobedience and idolatry, as seen in the books of Kings and Chronicles. The reference to "fathers" points to previous generations who also sinned, but the current generation has surpassed them in wickedness. This reflects the biblical principle that sin can escalate if not addressed, as seen in the cycle of sin in Judges. The comparison to their ancestors underscores the seriousness of their actions and the cumulative nature of sin.<p><b>See how each of you follows the stubbornness of his evil heart</b><br>The "stubbornness of his evil heart" indicates a willful resistance to God's commands. Biblically, the heart is often seen as the center of will and emotion (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). The stubbornness here is akin to the hardening of the heart seen in Pharaoh during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>). This phrase suggests a deliberate choice to reject God's ways, emphasizing personal responsibility. Theologically, it aligns with the doctrine of total depravity, which asserts that every part of human nature is tainted by sin, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>.<p><b>instead of obeying Me.</b><br>This phrase contrasts the people's disobedience with the expected obedience to God. Obedience is a central theme in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The failure to obey God leads to consequences, as seen in the curses for disobedience. This disobedience is not just a failure to follow rules but a rejection of a relationship with God. The call to obedience is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes love and obedience to His commandments (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the blessings tied to obedience and the relational aspect of following God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing impending judgment due to its persistent idolatry and disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fathers.htm">The Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the ancestors of the people of Judah, who had also turned away from God and followed idolatrous practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's prophecy, who were being warned about their continued disobedience and the consequences thereof.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is calling His people to repentance and obedience, highlighting their failure to follow His commands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_stubbornness.htm">The Danger of Stubbornness</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "stubbornness" (sherirut) implies a willful and obstinate heart.

The Lord is not exaggerating; He measures Israel&#8217;s conduct against the clear covenant standards in <a href="/bsb/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20&#8211;23</a> and <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27&#8211;30</a> and finds it worse than that of prior generations.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah had already noted this trend: &#8220;Yet they did not listen to Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck; they did worse than their fathers&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-26.htm">Jeremiah 7:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The same charge was leveled against the northern kingdom before its fall: &#8220;They became stubborn&#8230;like their fathers, who did not believe the LORD their God&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-14.htm">2 Kings 17:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture teaches that each generation must answer for itself (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>), but patterns of sin can intensify when unchecked. Judah&#8217;s compounding guilt shows that ignoring God&#8217;s warnings leads to ever-greater rebellion, never neutrality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>See how each of you follows the stubbornness of his evil heart</b><p>The indictment moves from the national level to the individual: &#8220;each of you.&#8221; No one can hide behind collective identity; personal hearts are in view.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah will soon declare, &#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). Here, that diagnosis is on display.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Stubbornness&#8221; (also in <a href="/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>) pictures an unbending neck, refusing the gentle yoke of God (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29-30</a> for Christ&#8217;s contrast).<p>&#8226; Isaiah had warned, &#8220;We all like sheep have gone astray; each one has turned to his own way&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). Every person trends toward self-rule unless God intervenes.<p>The verse exposes the root problem: sin is not merely external behavior but an internal disposition. Revival, therefore, must start with a changed heart (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Instead of obeying Me</b><p>The people&#8217;s stubborn pursuit replaces the obedience God desires. The contrast is stark: self-will versus God&#8217;s will.<p>&#8226; From Sinai onward, covenant blessing hinged on obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). Judah&#8217;s choice of disobedience consequently invites covenant curses (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>ff).<p>&#8226; God had pleaded, &#8220;Obey My voice, and I will be your God&#8230;and it will be well with you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>). They declined, proving that hearing truth without doing it is futile (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later sharpened the point: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Obedience remains love&#8217;s tangible expression.<p>Thus <a href="/jeremiah/16-12.htm">Jeremiah 16:12</a> confronts hearers with a life-defining decision: persist in self-direction or yield to God&#8217;s authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/16-12.htm">Jeremiah 16:12</a> exposes a generational escalation of sin, traces that escalation back to every individual&#8217;s stubborn heart, and contrasts it with the obedience God requires. The verse warns that ignoring God&#8217;s voice only deepens rebellion, yet it also underscores the hope implicit in repentance: when hearts turn from self-rule to God&#8217;s rule, obedience and blessing follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Imagination.</span>--Better, as before, <span class= "ital">stubbornness.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Imagination</span>;
