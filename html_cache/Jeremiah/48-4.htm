The prophecy of Moab's destruction is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, reflecting its historical enmity with Israel. The term "shattered" indicates a complete and devastating defeat, aligning with other prophecies against Moab found in <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15-16</a> and <a href="/amos/2.htm">Amos 2:1-3</a>. This judgment is part of a broader divine retribution against nations that opposed God's people. Archaeological evidence, such as the Mesha Stele, provides insight into Moab's historical context and its interactions with Israel. The shattering of Moab can also be seen as a type of the ultimate judgment against all nations that oppose God's kingdom.<p><b>her little ones will cry out.</b><br>The phrase "her little ones" likely refers to the children of Moab, symbolizing the nation's vulnerability and the widespread impact of its downfall. The crying out of the little ones underscores the depth of the calamity, affecting even the most innocent and defenseless. This imagery is reminiscent of the lamentations found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>, where the suffering of children highlights the severity of divine judgment. The crying out can also be seen as a call for mercy, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God's compassion for the innocent amidst judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

Centuries of mercy are brought to an end at a moment He appoints (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; This shattering fulfills earlier prophecies: Balaam foresaw a &#8220;star&#8221; that would &#8220;crush the forehead of Moab&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), and Isaiah described a night when Moab would be &#8220;destroyed&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>). God keeps every promise&#8212;both blessings and warnings (<a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>).<p>&#8226; For Israel, the fall of Moab is a reminder that the Lord defends His covenant people (<a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8&#8211;9</a>) and opposes pride wherever it rises (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-29.htm">Jeremiah 48:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>her little ones will cry out</b><p>The second phrase turns from national collapse to personal anguish. &#8220;Her little ones will cry out&#8221; pictures innocent children wailing as the calamity reaches every household.<p>&#8226; Judgment is thorough. When leaders fall, families suffer; sin&#8217;s ripple effects spare no one (<a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s heart still notices the tears. The scene echoes earlier laments over children in war-torn cities (<a href="/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>). Even in wrath, He remains compassionate (<a href="/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The crying voices expose Moab&#8217;s false security. Idolatry had promised protection (<a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7, 13</a>), but in the hour of need, Chemosh cannot save; only the Lord rescues (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>).<p>&#8226; For readers today, the verse cautions us against dismissing sin as merely personal or private. Choices made by adults shape the environment children inherit (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/romans/14-7.htm">Romans 14:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4</a> delivers a blunt, literal forecast: Moab&#8217;s power will be smashed beyond recovery, and the nation&#8217;s most vulnerable will wail in the chaos. God&#8217;s prophetic word proves utterly reliable, highlighting His justice against arrogance and His attentiveness to every cry that rises in the aftermath.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Her little ones.</span>--The Hebrew adjective is the same as the Zoar, the little one, of <a href="/genesis/19-20.htm" title="Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.">Genesis 19:20</a>, and that city may probably have been, as in <a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm" title="My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee to Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.">Isaiah 15:5</a>, in the prophet's mind.

We should expect Ar-Moab. <span class="cmt_word">Her little ones</span>. The received text, as it stands, is untranslatable, and our choice lies between the correction suggested by the vowel points, and the reading of the Septuagint and a few of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, "unto Zoar." In favour of the latter, which is adopted by Ewald and Graf, it may he urged that Zoar and Horenaim are mentioned together, not only in ver. 34, but also in <a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, which has evidently been imitated in the following verse. It is not quite clear what "her little ones" in the first mentioned correction mean. Some think, the children; others, the poor; Hitzig prefers the small towns of Moab. On the site of "Zoar," see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' but compare Canon Tristram in 'The Land of Moab.' <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4124.htm">Strong's 4124: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moab -- a son of Lot,also his descendants and the territory where they settled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be shattered;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#353;&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7665.htm">Strong's 7665: </a> </span><span class="str2">To break, break in pieces</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her little</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#238;&#183;re&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6810.htm">Strong's 6810: </a> </span><span class="str2">Little, insignificant, young</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ones will cry out.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;q&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2201.htm">Strong's 2201: </a> </span><span class="str2">A shriek, outcry</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/jeremiah/48-4.htm">OT Prophets: Jeremiah 48:4 Moab is destroyed (Jer.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/jeremiah/48-3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Jeremiah 48:3"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 48:3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/jeremiah/48-5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Jeremiah 48:5"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 48:5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
