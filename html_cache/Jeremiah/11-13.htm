Each city had its own deity, reflecting a departure from exclusive worship of Yahweh. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29-31</a>, where various gods were worshiped in Israel. The proliferation of gods indicates a deep spiritual decline and a violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Historically, this period was marked by syncretism, where the worship of Yahweh was mixed with Canaanite religious practices.<p><b>the altars of shame you have set up&#8212;</b><br>The "altars of shame" refer to places of idol worship, which were considered abominations in the eyes of God. These altars were often erected on high places, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>, where Judah built high places, sacred stones, and Asherah poles. The term "shame" underscores the moral and spiritual degradation associated with idolatry. Archaeological findings have uncovered numerous high places and altars throughout ancient Judah, confirming the biblical narrative of widespread idol worship.<p><b>the altars to burn incense to Baal&#8212;</b><br>Baal was a prominent Canaanite deity associated with fertility and storms. The worship of Baal involved rituals that were detestable to Yahweh, including child sacrifice and sexual immorality (<a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>). The burning of incense was a common practice in Baal worship, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>, where Josiah removed the idolatrous priests who burned incense to Baal. This practice was a direct challenge to the worship of Yahweh, who alone was to be worshiped with incense offerings (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>).<p><b>are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.</b><br>The comparison to the streets of Jerusalem emphasizes the extent of idolatry, suggesting that idol worship was as common as the streets themselves. Jerusalem, the spiritual center of Judah, had become a hub of idolatrous practices, contrary to its intended role as the city of God (<a href="/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a>). This widespread idolatry foreshadowed the coming judgment and exile, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>. The spiritual state of Jerusalem serves as a warning against turning away from God and highlights the need for repentance and return to true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

Every city has adopted its own false deity, revealing a nationwide departure from covenant faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14</a>).<p>- The phrase exposes a heart issue: the people&#8217;s trust has shifted from the LORD who brought them out of Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>) to a multitude of substitutes. Israel was to be a light to nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>), yet they now mirror the pagan world.<p>- Like the divided loyalty of Ephraim in <a href="/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>, Judah multiplies altars instead of fruit. The increase in &#8220;gods&#8221; signifies spiritual adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3-9.htm">Jeremiah 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The altars of shame you have set up&#8212;the altars to burn incense to Baal</b><p>- &#8220;Altars of shame&#8221; underscores the moral ugliness behind the religious fa&#231;ade (<a href="/psalms/106-36.htm">Psalm 106:36&#8211;39</a>). Burning incense to Baal was not innocent ritual; it violated the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>- The people &#8220;set up&#8221; these altars, revealing intentional rebellion, not ignorance (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9&#8211;10</a>). They chose cultural accommodation over covenant obedience.<p>- Baal worship often included immorality and child sacrifice (<a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>), making these altars doubly offensive. God calls them &#8220;shame&#8221; because sin always degrades the worshiper (<a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22&#8211;25</a>).<p>- Contrast: true incense was to rise only from the Temple altar (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7&#8211;8</a>). By imitating pagan practice, Judah forfeited the privilege of accepted worship (<a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are as many as the streets of Jerusalem</b><p>- The comparison to &#8220;streets&#8221; paints a vivid picture: idolatry saturates everyday life. Just as every path leads somewhere in the city, every direction the people turn they meet another altar (<a href="/jeremiah/2-28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a>).<p>- Jerusalem, meant to be &#8220;the city of the Great King&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1&#8211;2</a>), is inundated with rival shrines. Holiness is replaced by spiritual clutter.<p>- The omnipresence of idols parallels the pervasive sin in Noah&#8217;s day when &#8220;the earth was filled with violence&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>). God&#8217;s grief then foreshadows His righteous anger now (<a href="/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a>).<p>- This saturation also foretells judgment: just as the idols are everywhere, so consequences will touch every street (<a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>). Yet God still extends mercy to any who would tear down altars and return (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a> shows Judah drowning in self-chosen gods, proudly erecting &#8220;altars of shame&#8221; until idolatry lines every street of Jerusalem. The verse confronts us with the seriousness of divided loyalty: multiplying substitutes for the LORD invites His judgment and robs the nation of its calling. Faithfulness means one God, one altar, one Lord&#8212;anything less invites the very shame and ruin Jeremiah warned about.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">According to the number of thy cities . . .</span>--This and <a href="/jeremiah/11-12.htm" title="Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry to the gods to whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.">Jeremiah 11:12</a> reproduce what we have heard already in <a href="/context/jeremiah/2-27.htm" title="Saying to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.">Jeremiah 2:27-28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-17.htm" title="See you not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?">Jeremiah 7:17</a>.
