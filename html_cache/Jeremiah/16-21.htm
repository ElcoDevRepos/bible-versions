The use of "behold" serves as a call to attention, suggesting the importance of the forthcoming message. In the context of Jeremiah, God often communicates through the prophet to warn or instruct the Israelites. This aligns with the prophetic tradition where God reveals His will and plans to His people, often as a response to their disobedience or idolatry.<p><b>and this time I will make them know My power and My might;</b><br>Here, God promises a demonstration of His power and might, suggesting a direct intervention in the affairs of the people. Historically, this can be seen in the context of the Babylonian exile, where God's power was manifested through the judgment and eventual restoration of Israel. The emphasis on "this time" implies a definitive action that will leave no doubt about God's sovereignty. This can be connected to other instances in the Bible where God displays His power, such as the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12) or the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14).<p><b>then they will know that My name is the LORD.</b><br>The phrase underscores the ultimate purpose of God's actions: to ensure that His people recognize and acknowledge Him as the LORD. The use of "My name is the LORD" reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where knowing God's name implies understanding His character and authority. This is reminiscent of God's self-revelation to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where He declares, "I AM WHO I AM." The acknowledgment of God's name is a recurring theme in the prophets, emphasizing the need for Israel to return to true worship and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often the focus of Jeremiah's prophecies due to their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The impending event where Judah would be taken captive by Babylon as a consequence of their sin, serving as a backdrop for Jeremiah's prophecies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of false gods, a recurring sin of the Israelites that led to their judgment and exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_revelation_of_himself.htm">God's Revelation of Himself</a></b><br>God desires to make Himself known to His people, often through acts of power and might.
