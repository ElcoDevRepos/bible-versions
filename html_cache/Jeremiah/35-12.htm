Jeremiah, a major prophet, often received direct messages from God to deliver to the people of Judah. This underscores the authority and divine origin of the message.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* Jeremiah's ministry took place during a tumultuous period in Judah's history, leading up to the Babylonian exile. Prophets like Jeremiah were crucial in guiding the people and calling them back to covenant faithfulness.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* The phrase "the word of the LORD came" is frequently used in the Old Testament to introduce prophetic messages (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, <a href="/jonah/1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>). It emphasizes the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces.<br><br>*Prophecy:* This introduction often precedes a message of warning, instruction, or future promise. In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/35.htm">Jeremiah 35</a>, it follows the account of the Rechabites, who obeyed their ancestor's command, contrasting with Judah's disobedience to God.<br><br>*Types of Jesus Christ:* While this specific phrase does not directly typify Christ, the role of a prophet as a mediator of God's word foreshadows Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<br><br>*Archaeological Insights:* While there are no direct archaeological findings related to this specific phrase, the broader context of Jeremiah's ministry is supported by historical records of the Babylonian conquest and exile, which align with biblical accounts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
