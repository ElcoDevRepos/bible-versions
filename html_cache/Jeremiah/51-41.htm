This cryptic reference emphasizes the impending doom and divine judgment upon Babylon. Historically, Babylon was a dominant empire known for its grandeur and power, but its capture signifies the fulfillment of God's prophecy against it. The fall of Babylon is a pivotal event, symbolizing the ultimate defeat of human pride and rebellion against God.<p><b>The praise of all the earth has been seized.</b><br>Babylon was renowned for its splendor, wealth, and cultural achievements, often admired by surrounding nations. It was considered the "praise of all the earth" due to its impressive architecture, such as the Hanging Gardens, and its influential role in the ancient world. The seizing of this praise indicates a dramatic reversal of fortunes, where what was once celebrated is now brought low. This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly glory and the sovereignty of God over all nations.<p><b>What a horror Babylon has become among the nations!</b><br>The transformation of Babylon from a place of admiration to one of horror underscores the severity of its judgment. This phrase highlights the shock and awe experienced by other nations witnessing Babylon's downfall. It serves as a warning of the consequences of pride and idolatry. In a broader biblical context, Babylon often symbolizes the epitome of human arrogance and opposition to God, as seen in Revelation, where it represents the ultimate worldly system opposed to God's kingdom. The horror of Babylon's fall prefigures the final judgment against all ungodly powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheshach.htm">Sheshach</a></b><br>A cryptic name for Babylon, used in a form of Hebrew atbash cipher, where letters are substituted with their counterparts from the opposite end of the alphabet.
