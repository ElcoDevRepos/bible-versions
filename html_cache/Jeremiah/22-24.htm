His name is significant because the prefix "Jeho-" (meaning "Yahweh") is dropped, possibly indicating divine disfavor. The historical context is crucial here: Jehoiachin's reign was marked by political instability and the looming threat of Babylonian conquest. His lineage is important in the Davidic line, yet his removal signifies a break in the royal continuity due to disobedience.<p><b>were a signet ring on My right hand,</b><br>The signet ring symbolizes authority, identity, and personal ownership. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, a king's signet ring was used to seal documents, representing the king's power and approval. The right hand signifies strength and favor. The imagery here suggests that even if Coniah held a position of utmost importance and favor, his status would not protect him from God's judgment.<p><b>I would pull you off.</b><br>This phrase indicates a decisive and irreversible action. The removal of a signet ring signifies the loss of authority and favor. It reflects God's judgment and rejection of Coniah due to the sins of his reign and the nation's unfaithfulness. This act foreshadows the exile and the end of the Davidic kingship in its current form, yet it also points to the future hope of restoration through the Messiah, who would ultimately fulfill the Davidic covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>) in a spiritual and eternal sense.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>Also known as Coniah or Jeconiah, he was the son of Jehoiakim and king of Judah.

This sets a solemn tone, echoing earlier warnings to Judah such as &#8220;As I live, declares the LORD, surely you have spoken falsely&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/5-2.htm">Jeremiah 5:2</a>) and &#8220;As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely&#8230; I will bring judgment upon you&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>).

Similar prophetic markers appear throughout the book (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>; 22:3&#8211;5), reminding hearers that to ignore the message is to ignore God Himself. <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a> reinforces that whatever God speaks &#8220;will not return to Me void, but will accomplish what I please.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even if you, Coniah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah</b><p>The name &#8220;Coniah&#8221; (also called Jehoiachin in <a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8-16</a>) identifies the last king of David&#8217;s line to rule before Babylonian exile. Coniah was only eighteen when he reigned and is characterized as doing &#8220;evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/24-9.htm">2 Kings 24:9</a>).

The Lord&#8217;s oath guarantees that unrepentant sin results in removal from His favor, no matter how close the relationship once seemed.

The name of this prince appears in three forms :--(1) The abbreviated Coniah, as here and in <a href="/jeremiah/37-1.htm" title="And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.">Jeremiah 37:1</a> : this was probably the name by which he was known before he was proclaimed as king. (2) Jeconiah, with slight variations, in <a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm" title="The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-20.htm" title="Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;">Jeremiah 27:20</a>, and elsewhere. (3) Jehoiachin, also with varied spelling--probably the regal title assumed on his accession (<a href="/jeremiah/52-31.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.">Jeremiah 52:31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a>). The meaning of the name "Jehovah establishes" is constant in all the forms. In <a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm" title="Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.">2Kings 24:8</a> he is said to have been eighteen years old when he began to reign. In <a href="/2_chronicles/36-9.htm" title="Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.">2Chronicles 36:9</a> the age is given as eight. The latter is obviously an error of transcription. His reign lasted for three months only. There is probably a touch of scorn, as in the case of Shallum, in the prophet's use of the earlier name instead of that which he had assumed as king. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Coniah</span>. A shorter form of Jeconiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>), found again in <a href="/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>. Perhaps this was the name this king bore prior to his accession, after which it was certainly Jehoiachin; Jeremiah has already spoken of one king by his earlier name in ver. 11.
