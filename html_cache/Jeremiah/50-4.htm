It suggests a divinely appointed time when God will act decisively. This language is common in prophetic literature, pointing to events that are part of God's redemptive plan. It echoes similar phrases in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/joel/3.htm">Joel 3:1</a> and <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, which also speak of significant eschatological events.<p><b>the children of Israel and the children of Judah will come together</b><br>Historically, Israel and Judah were divided kingdoms after the reign of Solomon. This division led to separate destinies, with Israel (the northern kingdom) falling to Assyria in 722 BC and Judah (the southern kingdom) to Babylon in 586 BC. The prophecy of coming together signifies a future reunification, symbolizing the healing of past divisions and the restoration of God's people. This reunification is also seen as a type of the unity found in Christ, as referenced in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, where Christ breaks down the dividing wall of hostility.<p><b>weeping as they come</b><br>The weeping signifies repentance and sorrow for past sins. It reflects a genuine turning back to God, reminiscent of the weeping of the Israelites in <a href="/judges/2-4.htm">Judges 2:4-5</a> when they realized their disobedience. This emotional response is a necessary part of true repentance, as seen in <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>, where God calls His people to return with fasting, weeping, and mourning.<p><b>and will seek the LORD their God</b><br>Seeking the LORD implies a sincere desire to return to a covenant relationship with Him. This pursuit is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where seeking God is associated with obedience and blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).

But the description of the latter is a remarkable one. We are by no means to regard it as an idealized picture of the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel, any more than we can suppose the glowing promises in the second part of Isaiah to have their sole fulfilment in that disappointing event. No; it is the characteristic of Messianic prophecy that, with "foreshortened perspective," the prophets represent as equally near events which are really separated by ages. In the Book of Isaiah, for instance, preliminary judgments are repeatedly described in terms which, properly speaking, only apply to the great final judgment. In fact, each great political revolution is a stage in the Divine drama of judgment, which will reach its close in the final cataclysm. And so too here (as well as in <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-46</a>.) the promise of mercy to Israel, which began to be fulfilled in the edict of Cyrus, is represented as if the still future conversion of the people of Israel were actually accomplished. The description reminds us of <a href="/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18-21</a>. Notice the penitence of the returning exiles, and the reunion of Israel and Judah (see on Jeremiah 3:18). <span class="cmt_word">Going and weeping; they shall go;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they shall go, weeping as they go.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;In those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1436;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
