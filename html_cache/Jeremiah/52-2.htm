His reign was marked by political instability and spiritual decline. The phrase "did evil in the sight of the LORD" is a common biblical expression indicating disobedience to God's commandments and a failure to uphold the covenant. Zedekiah's actions included idolatry and alliances with pagan nations, which were against God's instructions. This phrase underscores the moral and spiritual failures that led to the Babylonian exile. The "sight of the LORD" emphasizes God's omniscience and the divine standard by which actions are judged.<p><b>just as Jehoiakim had done</b><br>Jehoiakim, Zedekiah's predecessor, also did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as recorded in earlier chapters. His reign was characterized by idolatry, oppression, and rebellion against Babylon, which ultimately led to his downfall. The comparison to Jehoiakim highlights a pattern of disobedience among Judah's kings, contributing to the nation's decline. This continuity of sinfulness among the leaders of Judah reflects the broader theme of Israel's unfaithfulness and the need for repentance. The reference to Jehoiakim serves as a historical reminder of the consequences of ignoring prophetic warnings, as both kings faced similar judgments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned from 597 to 586 BC.
