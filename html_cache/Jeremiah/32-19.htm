The term "great in counsel" reflects God's wisdom and perfect understanding, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>, where God's unparalleled wisdom is emphasized. "Mighty in deed" underscores His power and ability to act, reminiscent of His mighty works in creation and history, such as the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>). This duality of wisdom and power is a recurring theme in Scripture, affirming God's sovereignty and reliability.<p><b>whose eyes are on all the ways of the sons of men</b><br>This indicates God's omnipresence and omniscience, suggesting that nothing escapes His notice. <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a> states, "The eyes of the LORD are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good," reinforcing the idea that God is aware of all human actions. This awareness is not passive; it is active and discerning, as God evaluates the moral and spiritual quality of human conduct.<p><b>to reward each one according to his ways</b><br>This phrase speaks to the principle of divine justice and retribution. It echoes the biblical concept of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where individuals are held accountable for their actions. This principle is also evident in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience to God's commandments. It underscores the moral order established by God, where actions have consequences.<p><b>and according to the fruit of his deeds</b><br>This emphasizes the results or outcomes of one's actions. The "fruit" metaphor is common in Scripture, symbolizing the visible evidence of one's inner character and choices, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>, where Jesus speaks about recognizing people by their fruits. This phrase reinforces the idea that God evaluates not just actions but their impact and the heart behind them, aligning with the biblical theme of integrity and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
