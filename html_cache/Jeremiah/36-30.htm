Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, reigned as king of Judah from 609 to 598 BC. His reign was marked by disobedience to God and oppression of his people. The phrase underscores the seriousness of God's judgment against a king who failed to uphold the covenantal responsibilities of his office.<p><b>He will have no one to sit on David&#8217;s throne:</b><br>This prophecy indicates the end of Jehoiakim's dynastic line, a significant statement given the Davidic covenant in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, which promised an everlasting kingdom. Jehoiakim's son, Jehoiachin, did briefly reign but was quickly deposed and taken into Babylonian captivity, fulfilling this prophecy. This highlights the conditional nature of the Davidic promise, contingent on the king's faithfulness to God.<p><b>and his body will be thrown out and exposed to heat by day and frost by night:</b><br>This phrase describes a dishonorable death and burial, a severe judgment in ancient Near Eastern culture where proper burial was crucial for honor and legacy. The exposure of Jehoiakim's body signifies divine retribution and shame, contrasting with the typical royal burials. This prophecy was fulfilled as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>, where Jehoiakim's death is mentioned without the honor of a burial, aligning with Jeremiah's earlier warnings in <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during Jeremiah's prophetic ministry.
