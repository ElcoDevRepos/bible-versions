The context is a rebuke against false prophets who were misleading the people of Judah. The phrase underscores the need for individuals to hold each other accountable in their pursuit of divine revelation. In ancient Israelite society, community and family were central, and spiritual discussions were often held within these close-knit groups. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>, "As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another," highlighting the importance of mutual edification in faith.<p><b>&#8216;What has the LORD answered?&#8217;</b><br>This question implies an expectation of direct communication from God, which was a common belief in the prophetic tradition of Israel. The people were encouraged to seek genuine answers from the LORD, contrasting with the false assurances given by deceitful prophets. This phrase also points to the practice of seeking God's will through prayer and prophecy, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Moses and Samuel, who often inquired of the LORD for guidance. It emphasizes the need for discernment and the pursuit of authentic divine messages, as opposed to human inventions.<p><b>or &#8216;What has the LORD spoken?&#8217;</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the importance of God's spoken word, which was considered authoritative and binding. In the historical context, the spoken word of God was delivered through prophets, who were regarded as God's mouthpieces. The phrase calls for a return to the true prophetic word, as opposed to the false prophecies that were prevalent at the time. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the power and reliability of God's word, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, "so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty." It also foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's word through Jesus Christ, who is described in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> as the Word made flesh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah was called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
