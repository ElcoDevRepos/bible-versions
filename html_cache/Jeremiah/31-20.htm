This imagery reflects the intimate relationship God desires with His people, despite their rebellion. The term "precious" indicates value and affection, while "delightful" suggests joy and pleasure. This echoes the father-son relationship seen in <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>, where God calls Israel His son. The use of "Ephraim" specifically highlights the tribe's prominence and its historical role as a leader among the northern tribes.<p><b>Though I often speak against him, I still remember him.</b><br>God's pronouncements against Ephraim are due to their idolatry and disobedience, as seen throughout the prophetic books. Yet, "I still remember him" signifies God's enduring covenantal faithfulness. This tension between judgment and mercy is a recurring theme in the prophets, illustrating God's justice and His unwavering commitment to His promises. The remembrance here is not merely cognitive but relational, indicating a desire for restoration.<p><b>Therefore My heart yearns for him;</b><br>The phrase "My heart yearns" conveys deep emotional longing, akin to a parent's love for a wayward child. This anthropomorphic expression reveals God's compassionate nature and His desire for reconciliation. The Hebrew term used here can also imply a stirring or tumult within, suggesting the intensity of God's feelings. This yearning is consistent with the portrayal of God in passages like <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>, where God's compassion is likened to that of a mother's for her child.<p><b>I have great compassion for him,&#8221; declares the LORD.</b><br>God's compassion is central to His character, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where He is described as "compassionate and gracious." This compassion is not passive but active, leading to forgiveness and restoration. The declaration "declares the LORD" underscores the certainty and authority of this promise. It assures the reader of God's unchanging nature and His ultimate plan for redemption, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's compassion and offers salvation to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the Northern Kingdom of Israel, often used as a symbol for the entire nation due to its prominence.

On the former view, the words express the yearning of a father's heart towards the son whom he still loves in spite of all his faults. Jehovah wonders, as it were, at his affection for one who has been so rebellious. On the latter, they give prominence to the faults as having deprived him of all claim to love, even though the father's heart yearned towards the prodigal in pity. The former gives, beyond all doubt, the best meaning. In every word, whether of reproof or invitation, there was implied a loving remembrance.<p><span class= "bld">For since I spake against him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">As often as I speak to him. </span>The preposition can hardly have the meaning of "against," for which Jeremiah uses different words, and implies rather (as in the "communed with" of <a href="/1_samuel/25-39.htm" title="And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept his servant from evil: for the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.">1Samuel 25:39</a>; "When she shall be spoken for," Song <a href="/songs/8-8.htm" title="We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?">Song of Solomon 8:8</a>)--speaking with a view to win. By some commentators (Ewald) the word for "speak" is rendered "smite," but the ordinary rendering gives an adequate meaning. The original gives both for "earnestly remember" and "surely have mercy" the Hebrew idiom of reduplication--<span class= "ital">Remembering, I remember; pitying, I pity. </span>The thought expressed is that Jehovah could not bring himself to utter the sentence of rejection. His love turned to the penitent who turned to Him. We have something like a foreshadowing of the love of the father of the prodigal in <a href="/luke/15-20.htm" title="And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.">Luke 15:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The Divine speaker asks, as it were in surprise, whether Ephraim, who has so flagrantly sinned against him, can really be his <span class="cmt_word">dear</span> (or, <span class="accented">precious</span>) <span class="cmt_word">son</span>, his <span class="cmt_word">pleasant child</span> (literally, <span class="accented">child of caressing, i.e.</span> one caressed). The latter expression occurs in a remarkable passage of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Since I spake against him;</span> rather, as <span class="accented">often as I spake against him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as often as I pronounced sentence against Ephraim - such a sentence as is recorded in <a href="/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8-21</a> (where the future tenses should he perfects) and Isaiah 28:1-4. We must remember that, with God, to speak is to perform. Often as Jehovah punished Israel, he still remembered him in love - a love which was the pledge of his future restoration to favour upon his true repentance. <span class="cmt_word">I do earnestly remember;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">verily</span> <span class="accented">remembered.</span> "To remember" is the Old Testament term for providential care (comp. <a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-29.htm">Genesis 19:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My bowels are troubled;</span> literally, <span class="accented">sound, moan</span> (so <a href="/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>). Something analogous to the thrilling sensation of deep human grief is predicated of Jehovah. Such is the "humility" of the God of revelation (<a href="/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>; comp. <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Is not Ephraim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_669.htm">Strong's 669: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ephraim -- a son of Joseph, also his descendants and their territory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a precious</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(yaq&#183;q&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3357.htm">Strong's 3357: </a> </span><span class="str2">Very precious, dear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son to Me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1461;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
