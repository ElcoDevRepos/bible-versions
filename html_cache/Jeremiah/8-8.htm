In the biblical context, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord and adherence to His commandments (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The people claimed to possess wisdom because they had the Law, or Torah, which was central to Jewish life and worship. However, their actions and attitudes contradicted this claim. Historically, the Law was given to Israel as a covenant, a guide for living in a way that was pleasing to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5-8</a>). The irony here is that despite having the Law, the people were not living according to its precepts, thus nullifying their claim to wisdom.<p><b>when in fact the lying pen of the scribes has produced a deception?</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the corruption and unfaithfulness of the scribes, who were responsible for copying and interpreting the Scriptures. The "lying pen" suggests that they were distorting the truth, either through intentional misinterpretation or by altering the text to suit their purposes. This deception led the people away from true understanding and obedience to God's Law. In the broader biblical narrative, scribes were expected to be guardians of the Law (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6, 10</a>), but here they are accused of leading the people astray. This critique foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus frequently rebukes the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy and legalism (<a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13-36</a>). The phrase also serves as a warning against false teachings and the importance of adhering to the true Word of God, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Like the prophet&#8217;s earlier warning, &#8220;Do not trust in deceptive words&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>), the line challenges Judah&#8217;s smug confidence. God is not impressed by pious talk; He weighs the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The question itself signals that their boast will not stand under divine scrutiny, just as Paul later asks, &#8220;You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We are wise</b><p>&#8226; The people congratulate themselves on discernment, yet Proverbs warns, &#8220;Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?

By rejecting that foundation, Judah&#8217;s claim collapses (<a href="/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries later, Paul echoes Jeremiah by urging believers to become &#8220;fools&#8221; in the world&#8217;s estimation so that they might gain real wisdom from God (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the Law of the LORD is with us</b><p>&#8226; They possess the Scriptures physically (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5-8</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-19.htm">Psalm 147:19-20</a>) and assume that mere possession guarantees blessing.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah has already exposed this ritualistic confidence: &#8220;This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>).

Religious professionalism without truth always misleads.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has produced a deception</b><p>&#8226; The outcome is not harmless misunderstanding but full-blown delusion. Isaiah mourns, &#8220;Truth is missing&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/59-15.htm">Isaiah 59:15</a>), and Paul warns that persistent rejection of truth invites a &#8220;powerful delusion&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Deception spreads: leaders corrupt the text, people applaud, and society unravels (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).

The verse calls every generation to honor God&#8217;s word with humble obedience, ensuring that the pen&#8212;and the life&#8212;tell the truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">How do ye say . . .?</span>--The question is put to priests and prophets, who were the recognised expounders of the Law, but not to them only. The order of scribes, which became so dominant during the exile, was already rising into notice. Shaphan, to whom Hilkiah gave the re-found Book of the Law, belonged to it (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-15.htm" title="And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.">2Chronicles 34:15</a>), and the discovery of that book would naturally give a fresh impetus to their work. They were boasting of their position as the recognised instructors of the people.<p><span class= "bld">Lo, certainly . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Verily, lo! the lying pen of the scribes hath made it </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., the Law</span>)<span class= "ital"> as a lie. </span>The <span class= "ital">pen </span>was the iron <span class= "ital">stylus </span>made for engraving on stone or metal. The meaning of the clause is clear. The sophistry of men was turning the truth of God into a lie, and emptying it of its noblest meaning. Already, as in other things, so here, in his protest against the teaching of the scribes, with their traditional and misleading casuistry, Jeremiah appears as foreshadowing the prophet of Nazareth (<a href="/context/matthew/5-20.htm" title="For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:20-48</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/23-2.htm" title="Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:">Matthew 23:2-26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How do ye say, We are wise</span>? Jeremiah is evidently addressing the priests and the prophets, whom he so constantly described as among the chief causes of Judah's ruin (comp. Ver. 10; <a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8, 26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-9.htm">Jeremiah 4:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>), and who, in Isaiah's day, regarded it as an unwarrantable assumption on the part of that prophet to pretend to instruct them in their duty (<a href="/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The law of the Lord is with us</span>. "With us;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in our hands and mouths. (comp. Psalm 1:16). The word <span class="accented">torah</span>, commonly rendered" Law," is ambiguous, and a difference of opinion as to the meaning of this verse is inevitable. Some think these self-styled "wise" men reject Jeremiah's counsels on the ground that they already have the divinely given Law in a written form (comp. <a href="/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-20</a>), and that the Divine revelation is complete. Others that <span class="accented">torah</span> here, as often elsewhere in the prophets (e.g. <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>), simply means "instruction," or "direction," and describes the authoritative counsel given orally by the priests (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>) and prophets to those who consulted them on points of ritual and practice respectively. The usage of Jeremiah himself favors the latter view (see <a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; and especially Jeremiah 26:4, 5, where "to walk in my <span class="accented">Torah"</span> is parallel to "to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets." The context equally points in this direction. The most natural interpretation, then, is this: The opponents of Jeremiah bade him keep his exhortations to himself, seeing that they themselves were wise and the divinely appointed teachers of the people. To this Jeremiah replies, not (as the Authorized Version renders) <span class="cmt_word">Lo, certainly in vain made he it</span>, etc.; but, <span class="accented">Yea</span>, <span class="accented">behold I for a lie hath it wrought - the lying pen of the scribes</span> (so Authorized Version, margin). <span class="accented">Soferim</span> (scribes) is the term proper to all those who practiced the art of writing (<span class="accented">sefer</span>); it included, therefore, presumably at least, most, if not all, of the priests and prophets of whom Jeremiah speaks. There are indications enough that the Hebrew literature was not entirely confined to those whom we look up to as the inspired writers, and it is perfectly credible that the formalist priests and false prophets should have availed themselves of the pen as a means of giving greater currency to their teaching. Jeremiah warns his hearers to distrust a literature which is in the set-vice of false religious principles - a warning which prophets in the wider sense of the term ('The Liberty of Prophesyings') still have but too much occasion to repeat, tit is right, however, to mention another grammatically possible rendering, which is adopted by those who suppose <span class="accented">torah</span> in the preceding clause to mean the Mosaic Law: "Yea, behold, the lying pen of the scribes hath made (it) into a lie;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the professional interpreters of the Scriptures called scribes have, by their groundless comments and inferences, made the Scriptures (especially the noblest part, the Law) into a lie, so that it has ceased to represent the Divine will and teaching. The objections to this are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the necessity of supplying an object to the verb - the object would hardly have been omitted where its emission renders the meaning of the clause so doubtful; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that this view attributes to the word <span class="accented">soferim</span> a meaning which only became prevalent in the time of Ezra (comp. <a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6, 11</a>).] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_349.htm">Strong's 349: </a> </span><span class="str2">How?, how!, where</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can you say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;We</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1463;&#1428;&#1495;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;na&#7717;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_587.htm">Strong's 587: </a> </span><span class="str2">We</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are wise,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1499;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2450.htm">Strong's 2450: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the law</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;w&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
