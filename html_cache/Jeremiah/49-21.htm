The "sound" signifies the magnitude of the event, suggesting a significant and impactful collapse. Historically, Edom was a powerful nation, but its fall was prophesied due to its pride and hostility towards Israel. This echoes the broader biblical theme of divine justice against nations that oppose God's people, as seen in other prophetic books like Obadiah.<p><b>the earth will quake</b><br>The imagery of the earth quaking symbolizes the severity and widespread impact of Edom's destruction. Earthquakes in the Bible often accompany divine intervention or judgment, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a> during the giving of the Law at Sinai. This phrase emphasizes the power of God's judgment, affecting not just the immediate area but having a broader, possibly even cosmic, significance.<p><b>their cry will resound</b><br>The cry of Edom's fall is depicted as loud and far-reaching, indicating the distress and despair of the nation. This cry can be seen as a metaphor for the realization of their impending doom and the consequences of their actions. It also serves as a warning to other nations about the seriousness of opposing God's will, similar to the cries of other judged nations in Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>to the Red Sea</b><br>The mention of the Red Sea highlights the geographical extent of the impact, suggesting that the news of Edom's fall will travel far. The Red Sea is significant in biblical history as the site of the Israelites' miraculous escape from Egypt (Exodus 14). This connection may imply that just as God delivered His people from Egypt, He will also deliver them from their enemies, reinforcing the theme of divine deliverance and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often at odds with Israel.
