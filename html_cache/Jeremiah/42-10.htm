The context is post-Babylonian exile, where the people are contemplating fleeing to Egypt for safety. Staying in the land signifies trust in God's promise and His sovereignty. Historically, the land of Judah was the covenant land given to the Israelites, and remaining there was an act of faithfulness to God's covenant.<p><b>then I will build you up and not tear you down;</b><br>This promise echoes the language of restoration and hope. The imagery of building up suggests stability, growth, and prosperity. It contrasts with the earlier prophecies of destruction due to disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>). The assurance of not being torn down reflects God's mercy and willingness to restore His people if they obey.<p><b>I will plant you and not uproot you,</b><br>The metaphor of planting signifies establishing roots and permanence. It is reminiscent of the promises in <a href="/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>, where God speaks of watching over the people for their good. The idea of not being uprooted contrasts with the exile, where the people were forcibly removed from their land. This promise indicates a reversal of their previous judgment.<p><b>for I will relent of the disaster I have brought upon you.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's compassion and readiness to forgive. The disaster refers to the Babylonian conquest and exile, seen as divine judgment for the people's sins. The concept of God relenting is seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>, where God spares Nineveh.

The command is simple: remain where the Lord has placed you.<p>&#8226; Obedience here required faith&#8212;Babylon still ruled the land, cities lay in ruins, and fear was real. Yet God&#8217;s will was clear.<p>&#8226; Earlier, He had already promised, &#8220;Serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/40-9.htm">Jeremiah 40:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Choosing to &#8220;stay&#8221; echoes the principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, where life and blessing hinge on clinging to the Lord in the place He assigns.<p>&#8226; The same contrast shows up in <a href="/jeremiah/27-11.htm">Jeremiah 27:11</a>: those who submit live; those who resist perish. Remaining was therefore a concrete test of trust in God&#8217;s word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then I will build you up and not tear you down</b><p>The God who once tore down Jerusalem now pledges to become the master builder for His obedient people.<p>&#8226; This is covenant language of reversal: judgment gives way to restoration. &#8220;I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land; I will build them up and not tear them down&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise recalls <a href="/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;Again I will build you, and you will be rebuilt, O Virgin Israel.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Note the literal certainty: God Himself does the building; the people simply receive the blessing by staying put.<p>&#8226; Like the house on the rock (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>), obedience secures stability that no external pressure can topple.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will plant you and not uproot you</b><p>God shifts to agricultural imagery, stressing permanence.<p>&#8226; Planting speaks of security, fruitfulness, and future generations (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah had earlier heard the same words in 24:6 and 32:41, underscoring that this is not a new idea but a steady divine intention.<p>&#8226; Uprooting was the picture of exile (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>). The reversal means an end to wandering and the gift of a settled life under God&#8217;s blessing.<p>&#8226; For a traumatized remnant, the assurance of being &#8220;planted&#8221; rather than swept away would have sounded like life itself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for I will relent of the disaster I have brought upon you</b><p>God explains why He can offer such hope: His judgment has achieved its purpose, and He is now ready to withdraw it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/18-8.htm">Jeremiah 18:8</a> states the principle: if a nation turns from evil, God &#8220;will relent of the disaster&#8221; He intended.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a> affirms the same heart&#8212;&#8220;He relents from sending disaster.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a> shows the pattern in real time: repentance leads to divine relenting.<p>&#8226; Importantly, God does not deny the justice of the past discipline; He simply shows that mercy triumphs when His people respond rightly.<p>&#8226; The remnant&#8217;s path to safety is therefore not escape to Egypt but humble trust in the God who stands ready to withhold further calamity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10</a> offers a fourfold promise conditioned on one act of obedience&#8212;remaining in the land God assigned. Stay, and He will rebuild what He once tore down, plant what He once uprooted, and turn away further judgment. The passage vividly displays the Lord&#8217;s unchanging pattern: obedience brings blessing, repentance invites mercy, and His promises can be trusted literally, even when circumstances argue otherwise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Then will I build you, and not pull you down . . .</span>--We note the characteristic recurrence of the formulae with which Jeremiah's work as a prophet had begun (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm" title="See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.">Jeremiah 1:10</a>). The word for "repent" does not imply regret for the past, as men repent of their sin, but, as in <a href="/jeremiah/18-8.htm" title="If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.">Jeremiah 18:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm" title="If so be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.">Jeremiah 26:3</a>, a change of purpose from what had been the mind of judgment to one of mercy. The prophet's counsel is, as it had been all along, that the people should accept the punishment which God had inflicted on them, that they should stay where they were and as they were, and not in terror or suspicion seek safety in plans of their own devising.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Build you, and not pull you down,</span> etc. Some of Jeremiah's favourite phrases (see on Jeremiah 24:6). <span class="cmt_word">I repent me.</span> And yet in <a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a> we read that "Israel's Trust... is not a man that he should repent." The key to the discrepancy may be found in <a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25, 26</a>, "With the pious thou showest thyself pious... and with the froward thou showest thyself froward." There is no change in the nature or purpose of God, but only in his conduct towards man.
