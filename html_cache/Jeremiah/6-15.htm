In biblical terms, "abomination" often refers to idolatry and practices detestable to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>). The lack of shame indicates a hardened heart, a theme echoed in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel, where the people are often called out for their spiritual adultery and idolatry (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16-30.htm">Ezekiel 16:30</a>).<p><b>No, they have no shame at all;</b><br>The absence of shame signifies a deep spiritual decay. In the ancient Near Eastern context, shame was a powerful social and religious deterrent. The people&#8217;s inability to feel shame suggests a complete moral collapse, similar to the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19), which serves as a typology for divine judgment.<p><b>they do not even know how to blush.</b><br>Blushing is a natural response to embarrassment or guilt. The people&#8217;s inability to blush indicates a seared conscience, as described in <a href="/1_timothy/4-2.htm">1 Timothy 4:2</a>. This phrase underscores their complete desensitization to sin, a condition that often precedes divine judgment.<p><b>So they will fall among the fallen;</b><br>This phrase predicts the inevitable downfall of those who persist in sin. The imagery of falling is common in prophetic literature, symbolizing defeat and destruction (<a href="/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>, <a href="/lamentations/1-14.htm">Lamentations 1:14</a>). It suggests that the people of Judah will share the fate of other nations that have fallen under God&#8217;s judgment.<p><b>when I punish them, they will collapse,&#8221;</b><br>The certainty of divine punishment is emphasized here. The collapse is both literal and metaphorical, indicating both the physical destruction of Jerusalem and the spiritual downfall of its people. This aligns with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to national calamity.<p><b>says the LORD.</b><br>The divine authority behind the message is underscored by this phrase. It serves as a reminder that the words spoken by Jeremiah are not his own but are the declarations of Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. This assurance of divine authorship is a common feature in prophetic literature, reinforcing the certainty and seriousness of the message (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
