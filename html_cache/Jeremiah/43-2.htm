His name means "Yahweh has helped," which is ironic given his opposition to Jeremiah's message. The mention of his father, Hoshaiah, provides a genealogical context, emphasizing the importance of lineage in Jewish culture. This highlights the tension between those who should be leading the people in faithfulness to God and their actual rebellion.<p><b>Johanan son of Kareah</b><br>Johanan is another leader of the remnant, previously seen as a protector of the people (<a href="/jeremiah/40-13.htm">Jeremiah 40:13-16</a>). His name means "Yahweh is gracious," yet his actions contradict this, as he rejects God's guidance through Jeremiah. The mention of his father, Kareah, again underscores the importance of family heritage and the expectation of faithfulness to God's covenant.<p><b>and all the arrogant men</b><br>The term "arrogant" indicates a prideful and rebellious attitude, which is a recurring theme in the Bible regarding those who oppose God's prophets. This pride leads to a refusal to listen to divine instruction, a common issue among the Israelites that often resulted in judgment (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>said to Jeremiah</b><br>Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," faced significant opposition throughout his ministry. His role as a prophet was to deliver God's messages, often met with resistance. This interaction is part of a larger narrative where Jeremiah's warnings are consistently ignored, reflecting the broader theme of prophetic rejection.<p><b>&#8220;You are lying!</b><br>Accusing Jeremiah of lying is a serious charge, as it implies that he is falsely claiming to speak for God. This accusation reflects a deep mistrust and unwillingness to accept God's message, reminiscent of other instances where prophets were doubted or persecuted (<a href="/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>).<p><b>The LORD our God has not sent you</b><br>This statement challenges Jeremiah's prophetic authority and divine commission. It reflects a broader biblical theme where true prophets are often doubted, while false prophets are readily accepted (<a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>). The use of "our God" indicates a superficial acknowledgment of God, contrasting with their disobedience.<p><b>to say, &#8216;You must not go to Egypt to reside there.&#8217;</b><br>The command not to go to Egypt is significant, as Egypt represents a place of past bondage and a temptation to rely on human strength rather than God. Historically, Egypt was seen as a powerful nation, but God warned against seeking refuge there (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>). This command is a test of faith, echoing the Israelites' past struggles with trust in God during the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah_son_of_hoshaiah.htm">Azariah son of Hoshaiah</a></b><br>A leader among the remnant of Judah, who opposed Jeremiah's prophecy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/johanan_son_of_kareah.htm">Johanan son of Kareah</a></b><br>Another leader of the remnant, who also rejected Jeremiah's message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet of God, delivering a message to the people of Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place where the remnant of Judah desired to flee for safety, against God's command.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_judah.htm">The Remnant of Judah</a></b><br>The remaining people of Judah after the Babylonian conquest, seeking refuge.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>The "arrogant men" rejected God's message through Jeremiah.

He had witnessed God&#8217;s judgment firsthand, yet still distrusted the prophet.<p>&#8226; Like the princes who opposed Jeremiah earlier (<a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>), Azariah shows how position does not guarantee spiritual discernment.<p>&#8226;

Disobedience would place them where divinely decreed judgment would follow (<a href="/jeremiah/42-22.htm">Jeremiah 42:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The temptation to trust worldly refuge over divine promise echoes <a href="/numbers/14-3.htm">Numbers 14:3&#8211;4</a> when Israel longed for Egypt again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/43-2.htm">Jeremiah 43:2</a> records leaders who, driven by pride and fear, reject God&#8217;s explicit warning, accuse His prophet of deceit, and insist on their preferred path. The verse exposes the danger of selective obedience: invoking God&#8217;s name while sidelining His directives. True faith listens, even when the message disrupts our plans, trusting that God&#8217;s commands&#8212;however challenging&#8212;always lead to life and protection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/43.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XLIII.</span><p>(2) <span class= "bld">Azariah the son of Hoshaiah.</span>--The LXX., it will be remembered, gives this name in <a href="/jeremiah/42-1.htm" title="Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,">Jeremiah 42:1</a>, where the Hebrew has Jezaniah. Possibly, however, as suggested above, the two names represent brothers who were both prominent as leaders of the people. Here, we may note, he takes precedence of Johanan, probably as the chief spokesman of the prevailing discontent. The special mention of "all the proud men" suggests the thought that there were some who, left to themselves, would have been willing to follow the prophet's counsel. Those who join in the protest content themselves with a flat denial of his inspiration, and charge him, as he had been charged before (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm" title="And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>), with sinister intentions. It is suggestive, in connexion with the view taken in the Note on <a href="/jeremiah/42-17.htm" title="So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.">Jeremiah 42:17</a>, that the LXX., following apparently a different reading of the Hebrew, gives "all the aliens" instead of "all the proud."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the proud men.</span> It would seem as if the "proud men" were distinguished from others.
