Scrolls were the primary medium for recording important documents in ancient times. This act of writing on a scroll underscores the prophetic authority and the divine origin of the message. The use of a single scroll also indicates the completeness and unity of the prophecy against Babylon.<p><b>about all the disaster that would come upon Babylon</b><br>The disaster refers to the impending judgment and destruction of Babylon, a major world power at the time. This prophecy is significant as Babylon was seen as invincible. The disaster foretold is a direct consequence of Babylon's pride, idolatry, and oppression of God's people. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when the Medes and Persians conquered Babylon in 539 BC.<p><b>all these words that had been written concerning Babylon</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the prophecy. The words written are not just predictions but divine decrees that will surely come to pass. The phrase also suggests that there were previous prophecies concerning Babylon, highlighting the consistency and reliability of God's word. This connects to other scriptures where Babylon is a symbol of human pride and opposition to God, such as in Revelation, where Babylon represents the ultimate rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies of judgment and restoration.
