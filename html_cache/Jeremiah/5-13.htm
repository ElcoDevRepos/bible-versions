In the biblical context, wind often symbolizes something transient or insubstantial (<a href="/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>). The prophets in Jeremiah's time were misleading the people of Judah by proclaiming peace and safety when destruction was imminent (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>). This reflects a broader biblical theme where false prophets are condemned for leading people away from God's truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/13-3.htm">Ezekiel 13:3</a>).<p><b>for the word is not in them</b><br>The absence of God's word in these prophets indicates their lack of divine authority and inspiration. In the Old Testament, true prophets were characterized by their reception of God's word (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8-9</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of discerning true prophecy, which aligns with God's revealed will and character (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>). This also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on the Word made flesh, Jesus Christ, who embodies the ultimate revelation of God (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>So let their own predictions befall them.</b><br>This is a call for the consequences of the false prophets' own words to return upon them, a principle seen throughout Scripture where individuals reap what they sow (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). Historically, the false prophets in Jeremiah's time predicted peace and prosperity, contrary to God's warnings of judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13-16</a>). This phrase reflects the justice of God, who allows the falsehoods of these prophets to lead to their downfall, serving as a warning to others (<a href="/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>). It also highlights the biblical theme of accountability for one's words and actions (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
