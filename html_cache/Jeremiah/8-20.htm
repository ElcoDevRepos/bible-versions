In ancient Israel, the harvest was a critical period for gathering crops, which provided sustenance for the coming months. The harvest season was a time of hope and expectation, and its passing without a successful yield would have been a cause for concern. Biblically, harvests often symbolize times of divine judgment or blessing (e.g., <a href="/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a>). The passing of the harvest here suggests a missed chance for repentance and divine intervention.<p><b>The summer has ended</b><br>Summer in the ancient Near East was a time of intense heat and dryness, following the harvest. It was a period when people would prepare for the coming winter. The end of summer signifies the closing of a season of preparation and opportunity. In a spiritual sense, it implies that the time for repentance and turning back to God has elapsed. This echoes the urgency found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>, which urges seeking the Lord while He may be found.<p><b>But we have not been saved</b><br>This lamentation highlights the people's realization of their dire situation. Despite the passing of the harvest and summer, they remain in a state of peril. Historically, this reflects the context of Jeremiah's ministry, where Judah faced impending judgment due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry. Theologically, it underscores the theme of salvation and deliverance, which is central to the biblical narrative. This phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate salvation offered through Jesus Christ, who is often depicted as the Savior who comes at the appointed time (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>). The lament also serves as a call to recognize the urgency of turning to God before it is too late.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah. His ministry spanned the reigns of several kings and was marked by his deep emotional connection to his people and his message.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing impending judgment due to its persistent idolatry and disobedience to God. Jeremiah's prophecies were directed primarily at this kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_harvest_and_summer.htm">The Harvest and Summer</a></b><br>These terms symbolize times of opportunity and provision. In an agrarian society, the harvest and summer were critical periods for gathering food and resources.

When that window closes, no second &#8220;harvest&#8221; is coming. The people&#8217;s sigh, &#8220;The harvest has passed,&#8221; admits that a God-given season of opportunity is over (<a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4</a>).<p>- Spiritually, the Lord had sent prophets, warnings, even lesser judgments to gather His people back to Himself, yet they ignored them (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-26</a>).<p>- Jesus later used the same image: &#8220;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>), underlining the urgency to respond while the field is white.<p>- When God speaks of harvest, He is not casual. <a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a> pictures a final reaping; delaying repentance risks missing that ultimate gathering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The summer has ended</b><p>- After grain harvest comes the hot, late-summer stretch when figs and grapes ripen. By September, vines are bare and trees picked clean&#8212;no more produce till the next year. &#8220;The summer has ended&#8221; therefore means every last chance has slipped away (<a href="/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1-2</a>; <a href="/micah/7-1.htm">Micah 7:1</a>).<p>- Judah kept waiting for political rescue&#8212;perhaps Egypt would deter Babylon&#8212;but the calendar rolled on. Their human hopes paralleled the shriveling fields (<a href="/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10-11</a>).<p>- The line warns us that life&#8217;s &#8220;window&#8221; does not stay open indefinitely. Jesus&#8217; parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-20</a>) shows how fast a presumed future can disappear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But we have not been saved</b><p>- The lament reaches its ache: time is gone, and still there is no deliverance. This is not divine failure; it is human refusal. The very next verses ask, &#8220;Is there no balm in Gilead? &#8230; Why then has the healing of the daughter of my people not come?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>). The remedy existed; the patient would not take it.<p>- Jeremiah records similar cries: &#8220;Have You utterly rejected Judah? Has Your soul loathed Zion?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>). Yet God had already pledged rescue for any heart that would turn (<a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12-14</a>).<p>- New-Testament echoes deepen the warning:<p>&#8226; &#8220;How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Now is the favorable time; now is the day of salvation&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;There is salvation in no one else&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<p>- The only sufficient balm is Christ, whose blood secures the salvation Judah pictured but never embraced (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/8-20.htm">Jeremiah 8:20</a> captures the sorrow of forfeited opportunity. First, God provided a &#8220;harvest&#8221; season&#8212;clear calls to repent. Next, even the extra stretch of &#8220;summer&#8221; ran out. Finally, the people admitted the awful truth: still unsaved, they faced certain judgment. The verse presses us to seize God&#8217;s offered grace today. Seasons close, calendars turn, but in Christ the door of salvation stands open&#8212;until, at last, it doesn&#8217;t.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">The harvest is past . . .</span>--The question of Jehovah, admitting of no answer but a confession of guilt, is met by another cry of despair from the sufferers of the future. They are as men in a year of famine--"The harvest is past," and there has been no crop for men to reap.<p><span class= "bld">Summer.</span>--In <a href="/isaiah/16-9.htm" title="Therefore I will mourn with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water you with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for your summer fruits and for your harvest is fallen.">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/40-10.htm" title="As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come to us: but you, gather you wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.">Jeremiah 40:10</a>, and elsewhere, the word is rendered by "summer fruits." "The summer" (better, <span class= "ital">the fruit-gathering</span>) is ended, and yet they are not saved from misery and death. All has failed alike. The whole formula had probably become proverbial for extremest misery. It is well to remember that the barley-harvest coincided with the Passover, the wheat-harvest with Pentecost, the fruit-gathering with the autumn Feast of Tabernacles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The harvest is past</span>, etc. For "summer," read <span class="accented">fruit-gathering</span> (the vintage began in September). The people again becomes the speaker. The form of the speech reminds one of a proverb. When the harvest was over and the fruit-gathering ended, the husbandmen looked for a quiet time of refreshment. Judah had had its "harvest-time" and then its "fruit-gathering;" its needs had been gradually, increasing, and, on the analogy of previous deliverances (comp. <a href="/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>), it might have been expected that God would have interposed, his help being only delayed in order to be the more signally supernatural. <span class="cmt_word">But we are not saved</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">delivered</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/8-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;The harvest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1510;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7105.htm">Strong's 7105: </a> </span><span class="str2">Severed, harvest, the crop, the time, the reaper, a limb</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has passed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7687;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the summer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;yi&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7019.htm">Strong's 7019: </a> </span><span class="str2">To awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has ended,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3615.htm">Strong's 3615: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be complete, at an end, finished, accomplished, or spent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but we</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1463;&#1430;&#1495;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;na&#7717;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
