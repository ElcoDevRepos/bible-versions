The wrath of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. The people have broken the covenant, and divine justice demands a response. This wrath is not arbitrary but is a reaction to the people's idolatry and injustice, as seen throughout the book of Jeremiah.<p><b>I am tired of holding it back.</b><br>Jeremiah expresses the burden of carrying the message of impending judgment. The prophet's role is to communicate God's message, and here, he conveys the urgency and inevitability of divine judgment. This reflects the prophetic tension between mercy and justice, as God has been patient, but the time for judgment has come. This mirrors the patience of God seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where God is described as patient, not wanting anyone to perish.<p><b>&#8220;Pour it out on the children in the street,</b><br>The imagery of children in the street highlights the totality of the coming judgment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, children playing in the streets was a sign of peace and normalcy. The mention of children indicates that the judgment will be comprehensive, affecting all levels of society. This also underscores the severity of the situation, as even the most innocent and vulnerable will not be spared.<p><b>and on the young men gathered together.</b><br>Young men represent the strength and future of the nation. In the context of ancient warfare, young men were often the defenders of the city. Their gathering could imply preparation for defense or social interaction, but the judgment will render them powerless. This reflects the futility of human strength against divine judgment, as seen in other biblical narratives where human efforts are insufficient without God's favor.<p><b>For both husband and wife will be captured,</b><br>The capture of both husband and wife signifies the breakdown of family units, which were the foundational social structures in ancient Israel. This phrase indicates the complete disruption of societal norms and the devastating impact of the coming judgment. The capture of families also reflects the historical context of exile, where entire communities were uprooted and taken into captivity, as happened during the Babylonian conquest.<p><b>the old and the very old alike.</b><br>The inclusion of the elderly in this judgment emphasizes its totality and impartiality. In ancient cultures, the elderly were respected and often spared in times of conflict due to their vulnerability. However, this judgment is so severe that even they are not exempt. This highlights the seriousness of the people's sin and the comprehensive nature of God's justice. It also serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, as seen in the broader narrative of Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

The passage warns that sin&#8217;s consequences are comprehensive and inevitable once divine patience reaches its limit. Yet behind the severity lies a deeper call: repent while there is still time, for the same Lord who judges also promises restoration to all who return to Him (<a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>; 29:11&#8211;14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">I am full of the fury . . .</span>--The prophet feels himself filled, frail vessel as he is, with the righteous wrath of Jehovah. It will not be controlled.<p><span class= "bld">I will pour it out.</span>--Better, as the command coming from the mouth of Jehovah, <span class= "ital">Pour it out. </span>The words that follow describe the several stages of man's life, upon all of which that torrent of wrath is to flow forth--the children abroad, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>playing in the streets (as in <a href="/zechariah/8-5.htm" title="And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.">Zechariah 8:5</a>); the assembly, or gathering of young men, whether in their natural mirth (<a href="/jeremiah/15-17.htm" title="I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your hand: for you have filled me with indignation.">Jeremiah 15:17</a>) or for secret plans (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm" title="Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.">Proverbs 15:22</a>); the husband and wife in full maturity; the "aged," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the elder, still active as well as venerable; lastly, the man "full of days," whose time is nearly over and his sand run out.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I am full</span>; rather, <span class="accented">But I am full</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I will pour it out</span>. The text has "pour it out." The sudden transition to the imperative is certainly harsh, and excuses the <span class="accented">conjectural emendation</span> which underlies the rendering of the Authorized Version. If we retain the imperative, we must explain it with reference to Jeremiah's inner experience. There are, we must remember, two selves in the prophet (comp. <a href="/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a>), and the higher prophetic self here addresses the lower or human self, and calls upon it no longer to withhold the divinely communicated burden. All classes, as the sequel announces, are to share in the dread calamity. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the children abroad</span>; literally, <span class="accented">upon the child in the street</span> (comp. <a href="/zechariah/8-5.htm">Zechariah 8:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The assembly of young men</span>. It is a social assembly which is meant (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a>, "the assembly of the laughers"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But I am full of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1433;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb -
