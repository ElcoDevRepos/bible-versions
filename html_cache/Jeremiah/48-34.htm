Heshbon was a significant city, once an Amorite capital, and later a Levitical city in the tribe of Reuben. The cry from these cities signifies distress and lamentation, likely due to impending judgment or invasion. This reflects the broader theme of divine judgment against Moab, a nation often in conflict with Israel.<p><b>they raise their voices to Jahaz,</b><br>Jahaz was a site of a significant battle where Israel defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23-24</a>. The raising of voices to Jahaz indicates a call for help or a warning of danger. This location is symbolic of past victories and current desperation, highlighting the reversal of fortunes for Moab.<p><b>from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah;</b><br>Zoar, Horonaim, and Eglath-shelishiyah were towns in Moab. Zoar is historically linked to Lot's escape from Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22-23</a>). Horonaim is mentioned in other prophetic texts as a place of lament (<a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>). Eglath-shelishiyah, meaning "the third Eglath," suggests a specific location or a notable event. The mention of these towns underscores the widespread nature of the calamity affecting Moab.<p><b>for even the waters of Nimrim have dried up.</b><br>The waters of Nimrim were likely a vital water source for the region, and their drying up symbolizes severe drought or divine judgment. This imagery of dried waters is often used in the Bible to depict desolation and the removal of God's blessing. It serves as a metaphor for the spiritual barrenness and impending doom facing Moab, aligning with the prophetic theme of judgment throughout Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>A significant city in Moab, often associated with the Amorites and later the Israelites.

Its name appears often in oracles of judgment.<p>&#8226; Elealeh sits only a couple of miles north, so the &#8220;cry&#8221; racing between them pictures panic spreading through tightly linked communities.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the chapter the Lord declared, &#8220;No one will speak Moab&#8217;s name again&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>), showing that the outcry here fulfills the foretold humiliation.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that when a nation exalts itself against God, judgment touches every layer of society (see <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-17.htm">Jeremiah 25:17&#8211;26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they raise their voices to Jahaz</b><p>&#8220; &#8230;they raise their voices to Jahaz &#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Jahaz is where Israel, under Moses, defeated Sihon (<a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23&#8211;24</a>). It became a historical marker of God&#8217;s superiority over pagan kingdoms.<p>&#8226; Now Moab&#8217;s fleeing crowds &#8220;raise their voices&#8221; toward the same battleground, signaling desperation. What was once a site of Israel&#8217;s victory is now the route of Moab&#8217;s retreat.<p>&#8226; The Lord earlier said, &#8220;The sound of an outcry will be heard at Horonaim, devastation and great destruction!&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-3.htm">Jeremiah 48:3</a>). The shouting from Jahaz matches that prophecy.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s past acts are never mere history; they stand as ongoing testimony that He will always bring down pride (<a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah</b><p>&#8220; &#8230;from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah &#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Zoar, at Moab&#8217;s southern edge near the Dead Sea plain, anchors the breadth of the calamity (<a href="/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Horonaim, whose name means &#8220;double cavern,&#8221; lies further up the ascent, pointing to people scrambling uphill in flight (<a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-5.htm">Jeremiah 48:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Eglath-shelishiyah, literally &#8220;the third-year heifer,&#8221; pictures Moab as a pampered but unbroken animal suddenly driven to slaughter (<a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The sweep &#8220;from Zoar to Horonaim&#8221; shows no refuge left; every refuge crumbles when God&#8217;s hand moves (<a href="/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for even the waters of Nimrim have dried up</b><p>&#8220; &#8230;for even the waters of Nimrim have dried up &#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Nimrim&#8217;s streams supplied life to Moab&#8217;s arid land (<a href="/isaiah/15-6.htm">Isaiah 15:6</a>).

Heshbon&#8217;s outcry, Jahaz&#8217;s shouts, the flight from Zoar to Horonaim, and the drying of Nimrim together testify that no fortress, heritage, or natural resource can shield a people who exalt themselves against the Lord. The verse calls us to humility, dependence on God, and confidence that His judgments are precise, righteous, and certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">From the cry of Heshbon . . .</span>--Elealeh (now <span class= "ital">El-Al</span>) and Heshbon (now <span class= "ital">Hesban</span>) were about two miles apart. The panic-cry of the one city was echoed in the other; it reached even to Jahaz (see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/48-21.htm" title="And judgment is come on the plain country; on Holon, and on Jahazah, and on Mephaath,">Jeremiah 48:21</a>), to the south-west of Heshbon.<p><span class= "bld">From Zoar even unto Horonaim . . .</span>--Both names represent the south district of Moab. In the "heifer of three years old" (see <a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm" title="My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee to Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.">Isaiah 15:5</a>) many critics find simply a proper name, "the third Eglath," and conjecture that it was either one of three towns having the same name, or part of a <span class= "ital">tripolis </span>or tripartite city, the other two members of which were Zoar and Horonaim. Nothing is known, however, of any town so constituted, and the epithet of the "third-year heifer," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a heifer not brought under the yoke, would be a suitable name enough for either Zoar or Horonaim, as a virgin fortress, as yet untaken by the foe. (Comp. <a href="/hosea/4-16.htm" title="For Israel slides back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.">Hosea 4:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-11.htm" title="And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loves to tread out the corn; but I passed over on her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.">Hosea 10:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</span>--Recent travellers, Seetzen and De Saulcy, have found a brook Nimrah, with a mass of ruins near it, near the southern extremity of the Dead Sea. The Nimrah of <a href="/numbers/32-3.htm" title="Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,">Numbers 32:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/32-36.htm" title="And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.">Numbers 32:36</a>; Josh. 14:27, is probably too far to the north. Tristram (<span class= "ital">Land of Israel, </span>p. 54) identifies it with the <span class= "ital">Wady-Shaib </span>near the fords of the Jordan, and possibly with the Bethabara of <a href="/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - Based on <a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4-6</a>. The cry of one town echoes to another, and is taken up afresh by its terrified inhabitants. Heshbon and Elealeh lay on eminences but a short distance apart, so that the shrill cry of lamentation would be heard far away in the southeast at Jahaz. Zoar and Horonaim both lay in the southern half of Moah (see on vers. 3, 4). <span class="cmt_word">An heifer of three years old.</span> If this is the right rendering, the phrase is descriptive of Horonaim, which may, in the time of Jeremiah, have been a "virgin fortress." But the phrase, thus understood, comes in very oddly, and in the parallel passage in Isaiah it stands, not after Horonaim, but after Zoar; it hardly seems likely that there were two Gibraltars in Moab. Another rendering (Ewald, Keil) is, "(to) the third Eglath." This involves an allusion to the fact that there were other places in Moab called Egiath or Eglah, which has been rendered highly probable by Gesenius. <span class="cmt_word">The waters also of Nimrhn.</span> Canon Tristram speaks of the "plenteous brooks gushing from the lofty hills into the Ghor-en-Numeira." Consul Wetzstein, however, says that nature appears there under so unspeakably gloomy an aspect, that the identification is impossible. He proposes a site in the Wady So'eb, about fourteen miles east of the Jordan, which with its luxuriant meadows, covered with the flocks of the Bedouin, is probably suitable to the passages in Isaiah and Jeremiah (Excursus it. in Delitzsch's 'Jesaja,' 4th edit., pp. 572, 573). So also Seetzen, who remarks that the lower part of this wady is still called Nahr Nimrin. In <a href="/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> a place called Beth - nimrah is mentioned as situated in the valley (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jordan valley); no doubt this was in the wady referred to by the prophets. "The valley" seems to have been sometimes used in a wider signification, so as to include lateral valleys like that of Nimrim. The antiquity of the name is shown by its occurrence in the Annals of Thothmos III., who penetrated into the heart of Palestine, and, in the temple of Karnak, enumerates the cities which he conquered. From before <span class="date">B.C. 1600</span> to nearly A.D. this secluded valley has borne precisely the same name! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There is a cry</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1494;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(miz&#183;za&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;qa&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
