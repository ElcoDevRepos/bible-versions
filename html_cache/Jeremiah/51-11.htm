In ancient warfare, arrows were a primary weapon, and sharpening them indicates a call to arms. This preparation reflects the seriousness of the divine judgment that is about to be executed.<p><b>Fill the quivers!</b><br>Filling the quivers suggests ensuring an ample supply of arrows, symbolizing thorough preparation and the inevitability of the coming attack. It underscores the completeness of God's plan and the certainty of Babylon's downfall. The imagery of a full quiver also conveys the idea of being fully equipped for the task at hand.<p><b>The LORD has aroused the spirit of the kings of the Medes,</b><br>This indicates divine intervention in human affairs, where God stirs the Medes to act as His instrument of judgment against Babylon. Historically, the Medes, in alliance with the Persians under Cyrus the Great, played a crucial role in the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. This aligns with God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to use them to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>because His plan is aimed at Babylon to destroy her,</b><br>God's plan to destroy Babylon is a fulfillment of His prophetic word. Babylon, known for its grandeur and power, also symbolizes pride and opposition to God. The destruction of Babylon serves as a reminder of God's justice and the consequences of defying Him. This aligns with prophecies found in Isaiah and Daniel regarding Babylon's fall.<p><b>for it is the vengeance of the LORD&#8212;</b><br>The concept of divine vengeance is rooted in God's justice and righteousness. It is not mere retaliation but a rightful response to sin and rebellion. The vengeance of the LORD is a theme throughout the Old Testament, where God acts to uphold His holiness and the covenant with His people.<p><b>vengeance for His temple.</b><br>Babylon's destruction is specifically linked to its desecration of the temple in Jerusalem, which was a central place of worship and the symbol of God's presence among His people. The Babylonians, under Nebuchadnezzar, destroyed the temple in 586 BC, leading to the exile of the Israelites. This act of vengeance is thus a divine response to the violation of what was sacred to God, highlighting the importance of the temple in Israel's relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who orchestrates events according to His divine purpose and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kings_of_the_medes.htm">The Kings of the Medes</a></b><br>Rulers of the Median Empire, whom God uses as instruments to execute His judgment against Babylon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its conquest of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple, representing human pride and opposition to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem, symbolizing God's presence and the center of Jewish worship, which was desecrated by Babylon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vengeance_for_his_temple.htm">Vengeance for His Temple</a></b><br>God's retributive justice for the desecration and destruction of His holy temple by the Babylonians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of history and uses nations to accomplish His purposes, even in judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_retribution.htm">Divine Retribution</a></b><br>God's justice is perfect, and He will avenge wrongs done against His people and His holy name.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_nations.htm">The Role of Nations</a></b><br>Nations and their leaders are instruments in God's hands, whether they acknowledge Him or not.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_the_temple.htm">The Importance of the Temple</a></b><br>The temple was central to Israel's identity and worship, and its desecration was a grave offense to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_justice.htm">Hope in God's Justice</a></b><br>Believers can find hope in knowing that God will ultimately right all wrongs and bring justice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_51_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 51:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_51_11_s_guide_for_spiritual_prep.htm">How does Jeremiah 51:11 encourage us to prepare for spiritual battles today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_sharpen_the_arrows.htm">What does "sharpen the arrows" symbolize in our Christian walk?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Align_actions_with_God_s_will_in_Jer_51_11.htm">How can we align our actions with God's purposes as in Jeremiah 51:11?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Links_Jeremiah_51_11_Ephesians_6_10-18.htm">What scriptural connections exist between Jeremiah 51:11 and Ephesians 6:10-18?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_keep_hearts_stirred_for_God_s_plans.htm">How can we ensure our hearts are "stirred" for God's plans in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_51_11_God_s_judgment_on_Babylon.htm">How does Jeremiah 51:11 relate to God's judgment on Babylon?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Which_events_fulfill_Jeremiah_51_11.htm">What historical events fulfill the prophecy in Jeremiah 51:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_choose_the_Medes_in_Jer_51_11.htm">Why does God use the Medes as His instrument in Jeremiah 51:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_51.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 51?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_jer._50_9_match_babylon's_fall.htm">How does Jeremiah 50:9 align with recorded history of Babylon's overthrow by the Medes and Persians, given the text's specific military descriptions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_punish_babylon_if_god_used_it.htm">Jeremiah 51:7 calls Babylon a 'golden cup' in God's hand;

"The reason, probably, is twofold: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the name <span class="accented">Madai</span> became known to the Jews at an earlier period than <span class="accented">Paras</span>, 'Persia;' and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the generals of Cyrus were apparently Medes (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Mazares and Harpagus, Herod., 1:157, 162)" (Cheyne's 'Prophecies of Isaiah,' 2:275, 276). The new Cyrus inscription throws light on the latter circumstance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Sharpen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1305.htm">Strong's 1305: </a> </span><span class="str2">To clarify, examine, select</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the arrows!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;i&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
