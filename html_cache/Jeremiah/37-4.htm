At this point, he was not yet imprisoned, allowing him to move freely and deliver God's messages. This freedom highlights a temporary period of relative peace for Jeremiah, contrasting with the frequent opposition he faced. His ability to move among the people suggests a time when his prophetic voice was still accessible to the public, emphasizing the urgency and availability of God's warnings through him.<p><b>for they had not yet put him in prison</b><br>Jeremiah's imprisonment was a recurring theme in his ministry, reflecting the resistance and hostility he faced for his prophecies. This phrase indicates a specific time before his incarceration, which would later occur due to his unpopular messages predicting Jerusalem's fall. His eventual imprisonment symbolizes the rejection of God's word by the leaders and people of Judah. This period of freedom can be seen as a grace period, where the opportunity to heed God's warnings was still available. Jeremiah's experiences foreshadow the suffering of Christ, who also faced rejection and persecution for speaking truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile.

The people could not claim ignorance; Jeremiah&#8217;s words were ringing in their streets (<a href="/jeremiah/11-6.htm">Jeremiah 11:6</a>).<p>&#8226; It also demonstrates courage. Walking freely among those who resented his message recalls Paul moving openly in Ephesus despite opposition (<a href="/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For they had not yet put him in prison</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;for they had not yet put him in prison.&#8221; The phrase foreshadows coming persecution.<p>&#8226; Chapters 37&#8211;38 record that his freedom would soon vanish: he would be beaten and confined in a dungeon (<a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15&#8211;16</a>) and later cast into a cistern (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;not yet&#8221; underscores human resistance to God&#8217;s Word. Jeremiah&#8217;s arrest would not silence him; instead, like Peter and John later released and re-arrested (<a href="/acts/5-18.htm">Acts 5:18&#8211;20</a>), his testimony would grow louder through suffering.<p>&#8226; This line also exposes the leaders&#8217; shifting alliances. Early in the chapter Zedekiah seeks Jeremiah&#8217;s prayers (<a href="/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>), yet shortly afterward, fear of public opinion drives the king to imprison the very man of God he had consulted&#8212;echoing Pilate&#8217;s vacillation regarding Jesus (<a href="/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/37-4.htm">Jeremiah 37:4</a> captures a fleeting moment of prophetic freedom, emphasizing three truths: God grants merciful space for repentance, His messengers must live transparently among the people they serve, and opposition to divine truth may be delayed but will eventually manifest. Jeremiah&#8217;s brief liberty stands as a gracious invitation to hear and obey before the door of opportunity closes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Jeremiah came in and went out among the people.</span>--The statement is made in reference to the event narrated in <a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm" title="Why the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.">Jeremiah 37:15</a>.
