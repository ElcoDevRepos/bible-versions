Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and deported many of its inhabitants. The land in question is the Promised Land, which was given to the Israelites as part of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The casting out signifies a breach of this covenant due to the people's persistent idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>into a land that neither you nor your fathers have known.</b><br>The "land" refers to Babylon, a place unfamiliar to the Israelites and their ancestors. This highlights the severity of the punishment, as they are being sent to a foreign land with different customs, languages, and gods. The unfamiliarity underscores the loss of identity and the severance from their heritage and traditions. This also serves as a reversal of the Exodus, where God brought them into a land they did not know, but for blessing rather than judgment.<p><b>There you will serve other gods day and night,</b><br>This phrase indicates the forced assimilation into Babylonian culture, where the exiles would be surrounded by idol worship. It reflects the irony of their situation; in their own land, they chose to worship other gods, and now in exile, they would be compelled to do so. This serves as a fulfillment of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36-37</a>, where God warned of serving other gods in a foreign land as a consequence of disobedience.<p><b>for I will show you no favor.</b><br>The absence of divine favor signifies a period of judgment and discipline. In the context of the covenant, favor from God was contingent upon obedience. The withdrawal of favor is a direct result of the people's persistent sin and rejection of God's commandments. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual restoration, as the lack of favor is not permanent but serves a purpose in God's redemptive plan, ultimately pointing to the need for a savior, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

The land was a gracious gift (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), yet ownership was always conditional on obedience. By vowing to evict Judah, the Lord reaffirms that sin forfeits blessing, just as Adam&#8217;s sin expelled him from Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into a land that neither you nor your fathers have known</b><p>Exile would remove the people to an unfamiliar, hostile environment&#8212;specifically Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>). The phrase underscores isolation: no ancestral memories, no covenant symbols, no temple worship. Earlier generations had never experienced life outside the promised land, so this threat was jarring. It parallels <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>, where God forewarned that a foreign king would take them &#8220;to a nation you and your fathers have not known.&#8221; By stressing the unknown, God makes clear that sin leads to disorientation and loss of identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There you will serve other gods day and night</b><p>While Judah loved idols at home (<a href="/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11</a>), exile would plunge them deeper into idolatrous surroundings, turning their sinful choice into forced servitude. Babylon&#8217;s culture would demand participation in pagan rituals (cf. <a href="/daniel/3-1.htm">Daniel 3:1-6</a>). &#8220;Day and night&#8221; suggests unrelenting domination. The Lord allows their chosen idols to master them, illustrating <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>&#8212;God &#8220;gave them over&#8221; to what they desired. Yet this captivity would also expose idols&#8217; emptiness, paving the way for later repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/29-12.htm">Jeremiah 29:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for I will show you no favor.</b><p>During the exile&#8217;s onset God withholds relief; protection enjoyed under the covenant is suspended (<a href="/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8-9</a>). The phrase recalls <a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>, &#8220;the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from His presence.&#8221; Divine favor&#8212;grace, covenant love&#8212;had preserved Judah despite past failures, but persistent rebellion exhausted the period of mercy. Still, even this stern sentence is not God&#8217;s final word; elsewhere Jeremiah promises future restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>). Judgment serves a redemptive goal: to purge sin and bring hearts back to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a> warns that ongoing idolatry will cost Judah the land, security, and divine favor. God will exile His people to an unknown nation where paganism dominates, turning their sinful preferences into oppressive reality. The verse highlights covenant accountability: blessings hinge on obedience, and rebellion invites judgment. Yet the same God who casts out also plans to restore a repentant remnant, underscoring both His holiness and His steadfast love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">There shall ye serve other gods day and night.</span>--The words are spoken in the bitterness of irony: "You have chosen to serve the gods of other nations here in your own land; therefore, by a righteous retribution, you shall serve them in another sense, as being in bondage to their worshippers, and neither night nor day shall give you respite."<p><span class= "bld">Where I will not shew you favour.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">since, </span>or <span class= "ital">for, </span>I will not shew you favour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A grim irony</span>.
