The "high plain" refers to the elevated plateau region of Moab, a nation east of the Jordan River. Historically, Moab was often in conflict with Israel, and its high plains were known for their strategic military advantage. The judgment here is part of a larger prophecy against Moab, reflecting God's sovereignty over all nations and His response to their sins, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Amos.<p><b>upon Holon,</b><br>Holon is one of the cities in Moab mentioned in this judgment. Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the region of the Moabite plateau. The mention of specific cities underscores the comprehensive nature of the judgment. Holon, like other cities, would have been a center of Moabite culture and religion, which often included idolatry and practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh. This judgment serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>Jahzah,</b><br>Jahzah, also spelled Jahaz, is historically significant as the site of a battle where the Israelites, led by Moses, defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites (<a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23-24</a>). This victory allowed the Israelites to settle in the region. The mention of Jahzah in Jeremiah's prophecy connects past victories of God's people with the present judgment against Moab, highlighting the continuity of God's plan and His justice throughout history.<p><b>and Mephaath,</b><br>Mephaath is another city in the region of Moab, mentioned in the context of the Levitical cities given to the tribe of Reuben (<a href="/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37</a>). Its inclusion in the prophecy against Moab indicates the thoroughness of the coming destruction. The Levitical connection may also symbolize the loss of spiritual heritage and the consequences of abandoning God's covenant. This judgment reflects the broader theme of divine retribution found throughout the prophetic literature, where cities and nations are held accountable for their actions against God's people and His laws.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/holon.htm">Holon</a></b><br>A city in Moab, mentioned in the context of judgment.

The &#8220;high plain&#8221; is the elevated plateau east of the Dead Sea, a fertile region where many Moabite towns thrived.<p>&#8226; The wording is sweeping: no corner of the plateau escapes God&#8217;s verdict (<a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1&#8211;9</a> echoes the same breadth).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Moab trusted in its natural defenses and wealth (<a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>). Now, even the heights they depended on are penetrated.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s consistent pattern appears&#8212;He resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The plateau&#8217;s prominence could not shield Moab from the literal, historic judgment God decreed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>upon Holon</b><p>The next phrase narrows the spotlight to Holon, one of several towns strung across the plateau (<a href="/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>). Though Scripture gives limited background on this specific location, its inclusion teaches important lessons:<p>&#8226; Each community is personally accountable to the LORD; judgment is not merely &#8220;national&#8221; in the abstract.<p>&#8226; Holon&#8217;s mention alongside more famous towns reinforces that God sees the small and the great alike (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; As with the cities of Judah listed in <a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>, individual names make the prophecy concrete, underscoring its literal fulfillment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jahzah</b><p>&#8220;upon Jahzah.&#8221; Jahzah has richer biblical history:<p>&#8226; Israel defeated Sihon the Amorite here on the way to the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries later, Jahzah lay within territory assigned to Reuben (<a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Under Moabite control in Jeremiah&#8217;s day, it now falls under divine judgment&#8212;illustrating that a past victory or spiritual heritage cannot substitute for present obedience (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-12</a>).<p>The mention of Jahzah therefore warns any people who drift from earlier commitments to the LORD. God&#8217;s word is consistent: He blesses obedience and disciplines rebellion, whether the setting is the wilderness era or the prophetic era.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mephaath</b><p>Finally, &#8220;and Mephaath.&#8221; Like Jahzah, Mephaath was a Levitical city in Reuben&#8217;s allotment (<a href="/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37</a>). Its priestly background highlights two truths:<p>&#8226; Proximity to spiritual privilege does not guarantee protection; only genuine faith and obedience do (<a href="/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; When a society turns from God&#8217;s standards, even its religious centers face accountability (<a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6</a> notes a similar warning to Shiloh).<p><a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40-42</a> shows Moab&#8217;s downfall will be comprehensive; Mephaath&#8217;s inclusion proves the completeness of that judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a> teaches that God&#8217;s judgment on Moab is thorough, moving from the broad &#8220;high plain&#8221; down to individual towns&#8212;Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath. Each name underlines the literal accuracy of prophecy and the personal accountability of every community. History, geography, or past spiritual privilege offer no refuge from divine justice; only humble trust and ongoing obedience to the LORD provide true security.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And judgment is come upon the plain country . . .</span>--We enter here upon a list of less known names, of which Jahaz, Beth-diblathaim, Beth-Baal-meon are found on the Moabite Stone inscription (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, xi.</span> 165-168).
