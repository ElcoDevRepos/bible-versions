It is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to signify that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. This underscores the importance and reliability of the message that follows.<p><b>If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night:</b><br>The reference to a covenant with day and night alludes to the natural order established by God at creation (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-19</a>). This covenant is unbreakable by human means, highlighting God's control over creation. The imagery of day and night is also used in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/74-16.htm">Psalm 74:16</a>, to demonstrate God's sovereignty. The use of "covenant" here signifies a binding agreement, reflecting the unchanging nature of God's promises, similar to His covenant with Noah in <a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>.<p><b>so that day and night cease to occupy their appointed time:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the regularity and reliability of the natural order, which is a testament to God's faithfulness. The appointed time for day and night is a reflection of God's precise and orderly creation. In Jeremiah's context, this serves as an assurance of God's unchanging promises to Israel, despite their current circumstances. The imagery of day and night ceasing is hyperbolic, illustrating the impossibility of God's covenant being broken. This also foreshadows the eternal nature of God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-25.htm">Revelation 21:25</a>, where there is no night.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-making God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_with_day_and_night.htm">Covenant with Day and Night</a></b><br>A metaphorical expression of God's unbreakable promises, referring to the regularity and reliability of day and night as established by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, to whom Jeremiah's prophecies were primarily directed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Jeremiah's prophecies, during which Judah was taken into captivity by Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Just as the day and night are reliable and consistent, so are God's promises.

Therefore, God&#8217;s redemptive promises are at least this secure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And My covenant with the night</b><p>Nighttime, too, is under covenant.<p>&#8226; The heavens &#8220;pour forth knowledge&#8221; both &#8220;day after day&#8221; and &#8220;night after night&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/19-2.htm">Psalm 19:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God asked Job, &#8220;Have you ever in your days commanded the morning, appointed the dawn to know its place?&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-12.htm">Job 38:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah earlier anchored Israel&#8217;s future to the same daily cycle (<a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35-36</a>).<p>If breaking daylight is impossible, extinguishing night is equally unthinkable. God pairs them to stress the total impossibility of overturning His plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that day and night cease to occupy their appointed time</b><p>The challenge is hypothetical. If someone could halt the cosmic clock, then&#8212;only then&#8212;could God&#8217;s covenant promises fail.<p>&#8226; Immediately after this verse, God applies the logic: just as day and night can&#8217;t be annulled, neither can His covenant with David&#8217;s line or with the Levitical priests (<a href="/jeremiah/33-21.htm">Jeremiah 33:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; The apostle Paul echoes this certainty: &#8220;The gifts and call of God are irrevocable&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Revelation closes Scripture by depicting eternal light supplied by God&#8217;s own presence (<a href="/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>), proving the cycle culminates&#8212;not collapses&#8212;in His faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20</a> uses the unbreakable cycle of day and night to illustrate the unbreakable nature of God&#8217;s promises. Just as no one can stop the sun from rising or force night to skip its turn, no power in heaven or on earth can cancel the Lord&#8217;s covenant purposes. His word is more certain than the sunrise, more lasting than the stars, and utterly dependable for all who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - The constant, regular succession of day and night is an emblem of the equally regular supply of royal descendants of David and of Levitical priests, and the countless grains of sand are symbolic of the wonderful increase of their numbers. At first sight the latter part of the promise seems a little unlike a blessing. But we have seen already (on <a href="/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3</a>) that the members of the various branches of the royal family probably occupied the principal offices of the state, and the prophet imagines the future in forms borrowed from the present. A numerous sacerdotal class seemed equally necessary for the due magnificence of the ritual; and we must remember that preternatural fertility of the soil was a standing element of Messianic descriptions. The expressions used are, no doubt, hyperbolical, but the meaning seems clear enough. (Hengstenberg's notion, that the prophet rather indicates the abolition of the royal and sacerdotal distinctions (comp. <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), is surely very far fetched.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/33-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1434;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you can break</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1433;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#234;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6565.htm">Strong's 6565: </a> </span><span class="str2">To break up, to violate, frustrate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My covenant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
