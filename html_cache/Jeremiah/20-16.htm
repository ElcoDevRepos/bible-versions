The reference to these cities highlights the severity of the judgment Jeremiah wishes upon the man who announced his birth. The lack of compassion underscores the totality of divine judgment, emphasizing that God's justice can be executed without mercy when warranted. This reflects the seriousness of sin and rebellion against God, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament. The destruction of these cities serves as a warning and a type of the final judgment, pointing to the ultimate justice that will be executed by Christ at His second coming (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>).<p><b>May he hear an outcry in the morning and a battle cry at noon,</b><br>The "outcry in the morning" and "battle cry at noon" suggest a state of constant distress and impending doom. In ancient warfare, attacks often began at dawn, and the sound of battle cries would signal the start of conflict. This imagery conveys a sense of relentless turmoil and fear, symbolizing the consequences of living in opposition to God's will. The morning and noon times indicate that the threat is pervasive, affecting the entire day, and leaving no time for peace or rest. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin, as seen in the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-57</a>, where disobedience leads to continuous fear and destruction. The imagery also foreshadows the spiritual battles faced by believers, reminding them of the need for vigilance and reliance on God's strength (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is speaking in this passage.

&#8220;Without compassion&#8221; reminds us that when divine patience ends, judgment is thorough (<a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s words are not vindictive excess but a candid expression of anguish that God Himself records, showing Scripture&#8217;s honesty about human emotion (<a href="/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3&#8211;10</a>;

The imagery of overthrown cities, morning cries, and midday alarms underscores the severity of divine judgment and reflects Jeremiah&#8217;s own experience of unending opposition. Even in its intensity, the verse affirms the certainty of God&#8217;s justice and the sobering reality that rejecting His purposes invites total ruin&#8212;truths fully consistent with the wider testimony of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">The cities which the Lord overthrew.</span>--The verb is the same as that used in <a href="/genesis/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelled.">Genesis 19:29</a>, and the reference is clearly to the "cities of the plain," whose destruction is there described.
