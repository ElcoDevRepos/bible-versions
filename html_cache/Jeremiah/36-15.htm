In ancient Near Eastern culture, sitting was often a posture for teaching or delivering important messages, as seen in other biblical instances such as Jesus sitting to teach (<a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>). The request to sit down also implies a readiness to listen attentively, highlighting the gravity of the situation. The officials' request shows their recognition of the authority of the message, which is a scroll dictated by the prophet Jeremiah.<p><b>&#8220;and read it in our hearing.&#8221;</b><br>The officials' request for Baruch to read the scroll aloud underscores the oral tradition prevalent in ancient times, where public reading was a primary means of communication. This practice ensured that those who were illiterate could still receive the message. The phrase also emphasizes the communal aspect of receiving God's word, as hearing together can lead to collective understanding and response. This mirrors the public readings of the Law in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-8</a>, where Ezra reads the Law to the assembly.<p><b>So Baruch read it in their hearing.</b><br>Baruch, Jeremiah's scribe, faithfully fulfills his role by reading the scroll. This act of reading signifies obedience to God's command, as Jeremiah had instructed Baruch to write and read the words of the Lord (<a href="/jeremiah/36-4.htm">Jeremiah 36:4-6</a>). Baruch's role as a scribe is crucial, as scribes were responsible for preserving and transmitting God's word. This moment also foreshadows the New Testament practice of reading Scripture in the early church gatherings (<a href="/1_timothy/4-13.htm">1 Timothy 4:13</a>). The reading of the scroll is a pivotal moment, as it sets the stage for the officials' reaction and the subsequent events in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>The scribe and faithful companion of the prophet Jeremiah.

Their demeanor reminds us of moments when people paused everything to listen to Scripture&#8212;such as when Josiah heard the rediscovered Law and tore his robes in repentance (<a href="/2_kings/22-10.htm">2 Kings 22:10&#8211;13</a>) or when Ezra read to the returned exiles and &#8220;all the people were attentive&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/8-2.htm">Nehemiah 8:2&#8211;3</a>). By asking Baruch to be seated, they create a setting of thoughtful, deliberate listening, showing that God&#8217;s message deserves an unhurried place in daily affairs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they said</b><p>&#8220;They&#8221; are the royal officials listed in <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12&#8211;14</a>.<p>&#8226; They had just heard of Baruch&#8217;s public reading at the temple and exercised their responsibility to verify the scroll&#8217;s contents.<p>&#8226; Their initiative echoes the Bereans, who &#8220;received the word with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures daily&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode illustrates <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>: leaders should listen fully before responding.
