The assurance of rescue highlights God's faithfulness to those who act righteously and courageously. This phrase reflects God's sovereignty and His ability to deliver His people from peril, a theme consistent throughout Scripture, such as in the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>).<p><b>so that you do not fall by the sword.</b><br>The context here is the impending fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians. The sword represents the violence and death that would accompany the city's capture. God's promise to Ebed-Melech is a personal assurance of safety amidst widespread destruction, similar to how God protected Noah and his family during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-23.htm">Genesis 7:23</a>).<p><b>Because you have trusted in Me,</b><br>Trust in God is a central theme in the Bible, often linked to faith and righteousness. Ebed-Melech's trust is demonstrated through his actions to save Jeremiah, showing his belief in God's prophet and, by extension, in God Himself. This trust is reminiscent of Abraham's faith, which was credited to him as righteousness (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>).<p><b>you will escape with your life like a spoil of war,</b><br>The imagery of escaping with one's life as a spoil of war suggests a narrow escape from death, akin to a soldier surviving a battle. This metaphor underscores the value of life and the preciousness of God's deliverance. It also reflects the biblical theme of God granting victory and deliverance to His faithful, as seen in the story of David's triumphs (<a href="/1_samuel/17-50.htm">1 Samuel 17:50</a>).<p><b>declares the LORD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The declaration by the LORD emphasizes the authority and certainty of the promise. It is a divine assurance that what God has spoken will come to pass, reflecting His unchanging nature and faithfulness. This phrase is a reminder of the prophetic nature of God's word, as seen throughout the book of Jeremiah and other prophetic writings, where God's declarations are fulfilled in history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, including the promise of deliverance found in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ebed-melech.htm">Ebed-Melech</a></b><br>The Ethiopian eunuch who trusted in God and was promised deliverance in this chapter.
