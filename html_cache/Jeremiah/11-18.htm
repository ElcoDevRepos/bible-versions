In the context of the prophetic ministry, God often revealed hidden truths to His prophets (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). Jeremiah, as a prophet, was privy to divine knowledge that was not accessible to others. This revelation underscores the intimate relationship between God and His prophets, where God communicates His will and plans. The phrase also reflects the theme of God&#8217;s omniscience and His ability to disclose the intentions and plans of people, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>).<p><b>Then You showed me their deeds.</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to the specific content of the revelation. God not only informs Jeremiah but also provides insight into the actions and intentions of the people around him. This is significant in the context of Jeremiah's ministry, as he often faced opposition and conspiracy from those who rejected his message (<a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>). The deeds likely refer to the plots against Jeremiah's life, as revealed in the subsequent verses. This revelation serves as a warning and a call to action for Jeremiah, emphasizing the theme of divine protection and guidance for those who are faithful to God's calling. The phrase also foreshadows the suffering and persecution that Jeremiah, as a type of Christ, would endure, paralleling the opposition Jesus faced during His earthly ministry (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

God actively &#8220;informed&#8221; him, underscoring the personal relationship between the prophet and the LORD (cf. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; <a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The action is entirely God-initiated. Jeremiah did not discover the conspiracy by clever investigation; he received it because the Lord &#8220;searches every heart and understands every desire and every thought&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording this moment, Scripture affirms that the God who spoke in Jeremiah&#8217;s day continues to disclose truth. The passage assures believers that the Word we hold is trustworthy and literal, for it rests on God&#8217;s direct disclosure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so I knew</b><p>&#8226; Knowledge follows revelation. Jeremiah moves from uncertainty to certainty, mirroring how divine insight turns confusion into clarity (cf. <a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22&#8211;23</a>; <a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s confidence is grounded in God&#8217;s word, not personal intuition. In the same way, the church is called to &#8220;test everything; hold fast to what is good&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>) because God&#8217;s revelation provides an objective standard.<p>&#8226; This line also shows the protective nature of God&#8217;s guidance. By letting Jeremiah &#8220;know,&#8221; the LORD equips him to respond wisely, echoing <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>: &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God&#8230; and it will be given to him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then You showed me their deeds</b><p>&#8226; God unveils the hidden actions of Jeremiah&#8217;s opponents, especially the men of Anathoth who plotted his death (see <a href="/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21</a>). Comparable exposures appear in <a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6&#8211;12</a>, where the LORD reveals secret idolatry, and in <a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3&#8211;4</a>, where Ananias&#8217;s deceit is laid bare.<p>&#8226; The disclosure of &#8220;their deeds&#8221; highlights divine justice: &#8220;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, such passages reinforce both comfort and accountability. Comfort, because God defends His servants (<a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1&#8211;3</a>). Accountability, because our works are open before Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The sequence&#8212;revelation, understanding, exposure&#8212;models how God protects truth and righteousness in every generation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/11-18.htm">Jeremiah 11:18</a> reveals a three-step pattern: God speaks, the servant understands, and hidden sin is exposed.
