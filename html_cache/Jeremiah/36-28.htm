Scrolls were the primary medium for writing during this period, made from papyrus or parchment. The act of taking another scroll emphasizes the durability and permanence of God's message, reflecting <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>, "The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever."<p><b>and rewrite on it</b><br>The instruction to rewrite indicates the importance of the message that was lost. It underscores the belief that God's word is not only inspired but also necessary for His people. This act of rewriting is a testament to the divine inspiration and authority of Scripture, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, which states that all Scripture is God-breathed.<p><b>the very words that were on the original scroll</b><br>This phrase highlights the precision and accuracy required in transmitting God's word. It reflects the meticulous care taken by scribes in preserving the Scriptures throughout history. The emphasis on "the very words" suggests the inerrancy and infallibility of the biblical text, a core belief in conservative theology.<p><b>which Jehoiakim king of Judah has burned</b><br>Jehoiakim's act of burning the scroll is a historical event that illustrates the rejection of God's word by the leadership of Judah. This act of defiance is recorded in <a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>, where Jehoiakim cuts and burns the scroll piece by piece. It serves as a warning against the consequences of rejecting divine revelation, as seen in the eventual downfall of Judah.

Like Paul in <a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a> (&#8220;The word of God is not bound,&#8221;), Jeremiah learns that divine revelation cannot be chained to a single parchment.<p>- Obedience precedes insight: Jeremiah must first &#8220;take&#8221; the new scroll before hearing the rest of God&#8217;s instructions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and rewrite on it</b><p>- The prophet is told to reproduce, not reinvent. Preservation is an act of worship.<p>- <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a> required Israel&#8217;s king to hand-copy the Law; likewise, Jeremiah&#8217;s rewriting underscores how copying Scripture reinforces commitment.<p>- <a href="/revelation/10-11.htm">Revelation 10:11</a> tells John, &#8220;You must prophesy again,&#8221; echoing the same perseverance called for here. God&#8217;s messengers keep speaking until the audience finally listens&#8212;or faces judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the very words</b><p>- God cares about precise wording, not merely general ideas. <a href="/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a> affirms, &#8220;The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me; His word was on my tongue,&#8221;.<p>- &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), so every syllable carries divine authority.<p>- By insisting on &#8220;the very words,&#8221; the LORD teaches verbal inspiration: what He originally spoke remains exactly what He still intends.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that were on the original scroll,</b><p>- Continuity matters. The second copy must match the first, proving that the message has not changed with cultural pressures or royal opposition.<p>- <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>, &#8220;Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in heaven,&#8221;, guarantees textual permanence; heaven&#8217;s settled word demands earthly fidelity.<p>- <a href="/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a> echoes the same stability: &#8220;It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law,&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which Jehoiakim king of Judah has burned.</b><p>- Burning Scripture reveals hardened rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>).
