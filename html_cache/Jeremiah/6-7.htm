Wells were essential for survival, and their water was expected to be pure and life-giving. The comparison suggests that just as a well naturally and abundantly provides water, so does the city naturally and abundantly produce evil. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical passages where water is used as a metaphor for abundance, such as in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where Jesus speaks of living water. However, here the abundance is negative, highlighting the depth of the city's corruption.<p><b>so she pours out her evil</b><br>The city of Jerusalem is personified as a woman who actively and continuously produces evil. This reflects the moral and spiritual decay prevalent among the people. The use of "pours out" indicates an unrestrained and deliberate action, suggesting that the evil is not accidental but rather a result of willful disobedience to God's laws. This aligns with the broader context of Jeremiah, where the prophet repeatedly calls out the people's idolatry and injustice (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). The imagery of pouring out also connects to the idea of judgment, as seen in <a href="/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16:1</a>, where God's wrath is poured out upon the earth.<p><b>Violence and destruction resound in her</b><br>The terms "violence" and "destruction" highlight the social and moral chaos within Jerusalem. These words indicate not only physical harm but also the breakdown of societal order and justice. The sound of violence and destruction "resounding" suggests that these acts are pervasive and inescapable, echoing throughout the city. This reflects the historical context of Jeremiah's time, where political instability and foreign threats were constant. The prophet's warnings are consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to societal collapse.<p><b>sickness and wounds are ever before Me</b><br>"Sickness and wounds" symbolize the spiritual and physical consequences of sin. In the ancient Near East, physical ailments were often seen as manifestations of spiritual failings. The phrase "ever before Me" indicates that God is continually aware of the people's condition, emphasizing His omniscience and the seriousness of their sin. This aligns with the biblical theme that God sees and judges the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The imagery of wounds also points to the need for healing and redemption, foreshadowing the ultimate healing brought by Jesus Christ, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, where the Messiah is described as bearing our wounds for our healing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah. His ministry spanned the reigns of several kings and was marked by his deep emotional connection to the messages he delivered.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city referred to metaphorically as a well that gushes forth wickedness. It was the capital of Judah and the spiritual center for the Israelites, but at this time, it was steeped in sin and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His observation of the persistent sinfulness of Jerusalem. God is portrayed as a just judge who is deeply grieved by the moral decay of His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/violence_and_destruction.htm">Violence and Destruction</a></b><br>These are the consequences of the wickedness that Jerusalem is pouring out. They are both literal and symbolic of the societal breakdown and impending judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sickness_and_wounds.htm">Sickness and Wounds</a></b><br>These represent the spiritual and physical consequences of sin. They are ever-present before God, indicating the pervasive nature of the people's rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_sin.htm">The Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not a static condition but is often described as something that overflows or gushes forth, much like water from a well. This imagery suggests that sin, if unchecked, will continue to spread and affect all areas of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_awareness.htm">God's Awareness</a></b><br>God is fully aware of the sins of His people. The imagery of sickness and wounds being ever before Him indicates that nothing is hidden from His sight. This should lead us to live lives of transparency and repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The violence and destruction mentioned are both the natural and divine consequences of persistent sin. Understanding this should motivate believers to pursue righteousness and justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The passage serves as a call to repentance. Just as Jerusalem was called to turn from its wicked ways, believers today are called to examine their lives and turn back to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_health.htm">Spiritual Health</a></b><br>The imagery of sickness and wounds can be applied to our spiritual health.
