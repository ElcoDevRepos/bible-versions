The imagery of a vine is frequently used in Scripture to symbolize Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>). The choice vine indicates a selection of the best, suggesting God's favor and the potential He saw in His people. This planting signifies God's covenant relationship with Israel, where He nurtured and protected them, much like a gardener tends to a prized vine. The vine metaphor also points to the expectation of fruitfulness and righteousness, which God desired from Israel.<p><b>from the very best seed</b><br>The "very best seed" implies purity and quality, indicating that God provided Israel with everything necessary to thrive spiritually and morally. This can be seen as a reference to the patriarchs and the covenant promises given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The seed represents the foundational truths and laws given to Israel, which were meant to guide them in holiness and set them apart from other nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). The best seed also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>).<p><b>How could you turn yourself before Me</b><br>This phrase expresses God's astonishment and disappointment at Israel's unfaithfulness. The rhetorical question highlights the contrast between God's intentions and Israel's actions. It suggests a willful turning away, indicating that Israel's corruption was not due to external forces but their own choices. This turning away is akin to spiritual adultery, as Israel pursued other gods and forsook their covenant with Yahweh (Hosea 1-3). The phrase underscores the personal nature of Israel's rebellion, as it was done "before Me," emphasizing the direct affront to God.<p><b>into a rotten, wild vine?</b><br>The transformation into a "rotten, wild vine" signifies Israel's moral and spiritual decay. Wild vines were considered inferior and unproductive, often producing sour or bitter fruit. This imagery contrasts sharply with the "choice vine" and indicates a complete departure from God's intended purpose for Israel. The term "rotten" suggests corruption and worthlessness, reflecting the idolatry and injustice prevalent in Israel at the time (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13, 19</a>). This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns of the consequences of not abiding in Him, the true vine (<a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>). The wild vine serves as a warning of the dangers of forsaking God's ways and the inevitable judgment that follows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
