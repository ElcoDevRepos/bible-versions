Historically, this points to the return from Babylonian exile, where leaders like Zerubbabel, a descendant of David, played a significant role. Theologically, it emphasizes God's intention to restore Israel's autonomy and identity. This also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who was born from the line of David, fulfilling the prophecy of a leader arising from among the people.<p><b>and their ruler will arise from their midst</b><br>The ruler arising from their midst signifies a leader who is intimately connected with the people, understanding their struggles and needs. This can be seen as a contrast to foreign rulers who did not share the same heritage or faith. In a messianic context, this prefigures Christ, who lived among His people and shared in their humanity. The phrase underscores the importance of a leader who is both relatable and divinely appointed.<p><b>And I will bring him near, and he will approach Me</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's active role in establishing the leader's relationship with Him. It suggests divine selection and empowerment, ensuring that the leader is not only politically but also spiritually aligned with God's purposes. This is reminiscent of the priestly role, where approaching God was a significant aspect of intercession. In the New Testament, Jesus is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of this, as He is both King and High Priest, who approaches God on behalf of humanity.<p><b>for who would dare on his own to approach Me?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the holiness and sovereignty of God, indicating that approaching Him is not a matter to be taken lightly. It underscores the necessity of divine invitation and mediation. In the Old Testament, only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year. This foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the mediator who grants believers access to God, highlighting the gravity and privilege of such an approach.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase affirms the authority and certainty of the prophecy. It is a divine declaration, ensuring that the promises made will be fulfilled according to God's sovereign will. Throughout Scripture, when the LORD declares something, it is a guarantee of His faithfulness and power to bring it to pass. This assurance is foundational for the hope and faith of believers, both in the immediate context of Israel's restoration and in the broader messianic expectation fulfilled in Christ.<div

So in Isaiah we have a like introduction of the figure of the conqueror, "Who is this that cometh from Edom?" (<a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1</a>). As in <a href="/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1-3</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>, the dominant thought is that of one who will not be treacherous or faithless, like the degenerate heirs of the house of David whom Jeremiah had known, but one who would "engage" (literally, <span class= "ital">pledge, </span>or <span class= "ital">give as security</span>) his heart and soul to the service of Jehovah. In the advent of such a king the true relation between God and His people (<a href="/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm" title="And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return to me with their whole heart.">Jeremiah 24:7</a>) should yet be re-established. In the words "to approach unto me" we have the germ of the thought that the true King will also be a priest, and will enter, as others could not enter, into the Holy Place (see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/35-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.">Jeremiah 35:19</a>, and <a href="/numbers/16-5.htm" title="And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near to him.">Numbers 16:5</a>); a priest, such as <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a> had spoken of, after the order of Melchizedek. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The future rulers of Israel shall be of the native stock, not foreign tyrants. <span class="cmt_word">Their nobles;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his noble one</span>, a synonym for "his ruler," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the (earthly) king of Israel. It is remarkable that no reference is made here to the Messiah, who, in fact, is not as conspicuous a figure in the prophecies of Jeremiah as in those of Isaiah. And yet even in Isaiah there is one striking prophecy in which the inspired seer uses language not (in the hands of a literalist) reconcilable with the prospect of the personal Messiah. The Messiah appears, as it were, in a lightning flash, and then disappears for a time. The prophecy of Isaiah referred to is <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1, 2</a> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>), in which the prospect of a truly God-fearing king, with princes of the same high character, entirely occupies the mind of the writer. "Nothing indicates that the Messiah is intended; king and princes are placed quite on a level, in accordance with the actual state of things under the so called monarchy." <span class="cmt_word">And I will cause him to draw near.</span> It is doubtful whether Israel or Israel's ruler is referred to. A priestly relation (such as "drawing near" implies, see <a href="/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>) might be predicated of either, at any rate in the regenerate form of the Israelitish commonwealth; but it is more natural to suppose the ruler to be here indicated, for it is scarcely descriptive enough to say that he shall belong to the chosen people. <span class="cmt_word">Who is this that engaged his heart;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that pledgeth his heart</span> (or, <span class="accented">courage</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that ventureth. The rejection of thee old line of Davidic kings might well raise the thought that the intimate relation between Jehovah and his earthly representative for Israel, promised of old to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>.), could no longer be hoped for. But with this renewed promise the kings of the new Davidic line may venture to "draw near;" otherwise - who is he <span class="accented">that ventureth?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Their leader</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ad&#183;d&#238;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
