The "yoke" and "chains" symbolize the obligations and commitments Israel had under the Mosaic Law. Breaking them signifies a deliberate rejection of God's authority and guidance. Historically, this rebellion can be traced back to the period of the Judges and the monarchy, where Israel repeatedly turned away from God to follow other deities. The imagery of a yoke is often used in the Bible to represent submission and servitude (<a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>, <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29-30</a>). The breaking of the yoke indicates a desire for autonomy and self-rule, rejecting the divine leadership that was meant to guide and protect them.<p><b>saying, &#8216;I will not serve!&#8217;</b><br>This declaration of defiance highlights Israel's refusal to serve God, despite His deliverance and provision. It echoes the rebellious spirit seen throughout Israel's history, such as during the wilderness wanderings (Exodus 32) and the period of the kings (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7-8</a>). The phrase underscores a willful decision to reject God's sovereignty, choosing instead to follow their own desires. This rebellion is not just a physical act but a spiritual and moral decision to turn away from the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>Indeed, on every high hill and under every green tree</b><br>This imagery is associated with idolatrous worship practices common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. High places and green trees were often sites for pagan altars and rituals (<a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>, <a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>). These locations were chosen for their elevation and natural beauty, believed to be closer to the divine. The use of "every" suggests the widespread nature of Israel's idolatry, indicating that this was not an isolated incident but a pervasive problem throughout the land.<p><b>you lay down as a prostitute</b><br>This metaphor of prostitution is frequently used in the Bible to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15</a>). It conveys the idea of spiritual adultery, where Israel, likened to an unfaithful spouse, seeks other gods and engages in practices contrary to their covenant with Yahweh. This imagery is powerful, illustrating the depth of Israel's betrayal and the personal nature of their sin against God. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the Church as the Bride of Christ, called to faithfulness and purity (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The verse warns that casting off God&#8217;s authority never leads to freedom but to deeper bondage.

The Authorised Version, which follows the received Hebrew reading, may, however, be understood as referring to the deliverance of Israel from their Egyptian bondage.<p><span class= "bld">Thou saidst, I will not transgress</span>--Perhaps, following a various reading adopted by the LXX., Vulg., and Luther, <span class= "ital">I will not serve. </span>The words so taken paint vividly the wilful defiance of the rebellious nation. It threw off its allegiance. If we retain the Authorised version rendering, it would be better to take the verb in the present, <span class= "ital">I transgress not, </span>as expressing a like defiance.<p><span class= "bld">When.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for, </span>as giving an illustration of the rebellious temper. The "high hill" and the "green tree" point to the localities of idol-worship--the "high places" that meet us so frequently in 1 and 2 Kings, the "tops of the mountains," and the "oaks and poplars and elms" of <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm" title="They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit prostitution, and your spouses shall commit adultery.">Hosea 4:13</a>. Tree-worship in Judaea, as elsewhere, appears to have exercised a wonderful power of fascination, and though the word translated "grove" (<span class= "ital">Asherah</span>) has not that meaning, it was probably connected with the same <span class= "ital">cultus.</span><p><span class= "bld">Playing the harlot.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">laying thyself down. </span>The idolatrous prostration was as an act of spiritual prostitution, often, as in the orgiastic worship of Baal and Ashtaroth, united with actual impurity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Here a new section begins. <span class="cmt_word">I have broken... burst</span>. This is, grammatically, a possible rendering, but inconsistent with the second person in <span class="cmt_word">thou saidst</span>, unless indeed (with Ewald) we suppose that something has fallen out of the text between the first and the second clauses of the verse. The best critics, except Ewald and Dr. Payne Smith, are agreed that we should follow the Septuagint and Vulgate in rendering "thou hast broken... (and) burst." This does not, strictly speaking, imply a new reading of the text, for <span class="accented">ti</span> was the old form of the suffix of the 2nd pers. fem, sing.; there is a precisely similar case in <a href="/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>. It is a true description of the history of Israel before the exile. It would almost seem as if there was a fusion of two races among the Israelites, and that the smaller but nobler stock supplied all the great men in the sphere of religion; just as in Florence, most of the men who have illustrated her annals bear names of Teutonic origin. So we might argue, if we wished to explain the Biblical history from purely natural causes. But God (to apply the Caliph Omar's words) "knoweth his own." <span class="cmt_word">Bands</span> (see on Jeremiah 5:5). <span class="cmt_word">I will not transgress.</span> This is the translation of the marginal reading in the Hebrew Bible, which, though implied also in the Targum, is probably a conjecture of the Jewish critics. The text reading (also that of the Septuagint and the Syriac) is, "I will not serve," (equivalent to "I will not be a slave any longer"). Obviously this does not harmonize with the rendering "I have broken," etc., in the first clause (unless, with Dr. Payne Smith, we explain "I will not serve" as virtually equivalent to "I will still serve my idol-gods"); hence the Jewish critics, by just adding a <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>), changed "serve" into "transgress." They did not venture to alter the next clause, which, quite as much as the first, presupposes the reading "serve" (see next note). <span class="cmt_word">When</span> - rather, <span class="accented">for</span> - <span class="cmt_word">upon every high hill</span>, etc. Bare, treeless heights were favorite spots for sacrifices, especially for Baal; groves, and leafy trees, in general, for the lascivious rites of Asherah and Ashtoreth. The apparently extreme statement of the prophet is not to be minimized. Travelers still tell us of vestiges of ancient and doubtless pro-Christian idolaters worship still visible on almost every attractive spot in the open country in Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">Under every green tree</span>. We have no single word to convey the "fluid" meaning of this expressive word. It combines, in fact, the senses of pliant, sappy, leafy (comp. note on Jeremiah 11:16). <span class="cmt_word">Thou wanderest</span>; rather, thou <span class="accented">wast stretching thyself out</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">long ago</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
