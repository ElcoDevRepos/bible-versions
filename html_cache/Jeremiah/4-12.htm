In the context of Jeremiah, the "wind" symbolizes the impending Babylonian invasion, which would be swift and devastating. The imagery of wind is often used in the Bible to represent God's judgment or presence (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/13-13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a>). The phrase "comes from Me" emphasizes that this is a divine act, not merely a natural disaster or human conflict. It underscores God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate judge. The wind being "too strong" suggests that it is beyond human control or resistance, highlighting the futility of Judah's reliance on their own strength or foreign alliances.<p><b>Now I also pronounce judgments against them.&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse indicates a shift from warning to the declaration of judgment. The use of "now" suggests immediacy and urgency, implying that the time for repentance has passed, and the consequences are imminent. The "judgments" refer to the specific punishments that God will bring upon Judah for their idolatry and disobedience. This is consistent with the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The pronouncement of judgment is a common theme in prophetic literature, serving as both a warning and a call to repentance. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will come at the end of times, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

This &#8220;scorching wind&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a>) pictures an unstoppable, devastating force rather than a gentle, useful one.<p>&#8211; The image points to the Babylonian armies sweeping in from the desert, a judgment so severe that it destroys instead of purifies, much like the &#8220;east wind of the LORD&#8221; in <a href="/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a> or the &#8220;stormy wind&#8221; God uses in <a href="/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>.<p>&#8226; Just as wheat is tossed into a manageable breeze for separation, the people expected manageable discipline; instead, they will meet a hurricane of wrath (compare <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The wind&#8217;s intensity warns that sin has progressed past mild correction; see <a href="/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a> and <a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a> where the Lord&#8217;s chastening escalates when earlier calls to repent are ignored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>comes from Me</b><p>&#8211; The Lord claims full ownership: &#8220;a wind too strong for that comes from Me.&#8221; Nothing is random; God directs even invading armies (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a> asks, &#8220;If calamity comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?&#8221; The same truth stands here: divine sovereignty over both blessing and disaster (<a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the wind originates with God, human defenses are useless (<a href="/jeremiah/37-10.htm">Jeremiah 37:10</a>). The only refuge is in returning to Him (<a href="/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also comforts the faithful remnant&#8212;judgment is purposeful, not chaotic. The Lord who wounds also heals (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now I also pronounce judgments against them</b><p>&#8211; The Prophet transitions from metaphor to verdict. Having identified the storm, God states the legal outcome: &#8220;I also pronounce judgments against them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This judicial language echoes <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>, where God said, &#8220;I will pronounce My judgments against them for all their wickedness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Specific charges appear throughout the chapter: stubbornness (4:4), deceit (4:14), and idolatry (4:22; 5:19).<p>&#8226; The plural &#8220;judgments&#8221; points to layered consequences&#8212;military defeat (<a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22&#8211;26</a>), exile (25:8&#8211;12), and the loss of temple and land (52:12&#8211;15).<p>&#8211; Pronouncement means finality. Like the sealed sentence in <a href="/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11&#8211;14</a>, once spoken, the decree will be carried out unless genuine repentance intervenes (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a> moves from image to indictment. The Lord warns of a desert wind so fierce it destroys rather than sifts, symbolizing Babylon&#8217;s invasion. He declares Himself the author of this tempest, underscoring His sovereign rule over judgment. Finally, He announces the legal sentence against a persistently rebellious people. The verse stands as both a sober reminder that sin invites God&#8217;s active discipline and an invitation to seek His mercy before the storm breaks.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">A full wind from those places.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a wind fuller than those, </span>or, <span class= "ital">fuller than for this<span class= "bld"> . . .</span></span> <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>more tempestuous than those which serve for the work of the thresher, and blowing away both grain and chaff together.<p><span class= "bld">Shall come unto me.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for me, as doing my pleasure.</span><p><span class= "bld">Give sentence against them.</span>--<span class= "ital">sc</span>., against the sinful people of Judah and Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even a full wind from those places</span>.
