In the biblical context, God is portrayed as one who searches the hearts and minds of individuals (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). The question implies that God is actively seeking truth, yet finding it lacking in Judah. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's justice and His requirement for His people to live in truth (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>).<p><b>You struck them, but they felt no pain.</b><br>Here, the imagery of divine discipline is evident. Despite God's corrective actions, the people of Judah remain unresponsive. This can be compared to the plagues in Egypt, where Pharaoh's heart was hardened despite the clear signs of God's power (Exodus 7-11). The lack of pain signifies a spiritual numbness or insensitivity to God's chastisement, highlighting the depth of their rebellion.<p><b>You finished them off, but they refused to accept discipline.</b><br>This phrase suggests that God has brought severe consequences upon the people, yet they remain obstinate. Historically, this could refer to the various calamities that befell Judah, such as invasions and famines, which were intended as calls to repentance. The refusal to accept discipline is a recurring theme in the prophets, where the people ignore God's warnings (<a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>).<p><b>They have made their faces harder than stone</b><br>The metaphor of hardened faces indicates a stubborn and unyielding attitude. In biblical symbolism, a hard heart or face often represents resistance to God's will (<a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7-9</a>). This imagery is used to convey the people's determination to persist in their sinful ways, despite the consequences.<p><b>and refused to repent.</b><br>Repentance is a central theme in the prophetic books, calling for a return to covenant faithfulness. The refusal to repent underscores the people's rebellion and the seriousness of their sin. This connects to the broader biblical narrative where repentance is necessary for restoration and forgiveness (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The call to repentance is also a precursor to the message of John the Baptist and Jesus, who both preached repentance as essential for entering the Kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2, 4</a>:17).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The God who &#8220;looks for truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>) has examined them and found them wanting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You struck them, but they felt no pain</b><p>- Divine chastening had already fallen: drought, invading armies, national instability (see <a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-10</a>).<p>- Yet the people were numb; <a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a> laments a similar hard-heartedness&#8212;&#8220;But the people have not returned to Him who struck them.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a> teaches that discipline is an act of love, echoed in <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>. Judah&#8217;s dull response shows how far they&#8217;ve drifted: pain meant to awaken them merely produced indifference.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You consumed them, but they refused to accept discipline</b><p>- &#8220;Consumed&#8221; (or &#8220;finished them off&#8221;) intensifies the prior line: repeated judgments escalated until only a remnant remained (<a href="/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>).<p>- Instead of softening, they &#8220;refused to accept discipline&#8221; as in <a href="/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a>, where the nation is called &#8220;a nation that has not obeyed the LORD or responded to correction.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/proverbs/15-10.htm">Proverbs 15:10</a> warns, &#8220;He who hates correction will die.&#8221; The refusal isn&#8217;t intellectual; it is moral rebellion, just as <a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20-21</a> portrays end-times humanity who &#8220;did not repent of the works of their hands&#8221; even after severe plagues.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Faces harder than stone and refused to repent</b><p>- The imagery moves from action to character.
