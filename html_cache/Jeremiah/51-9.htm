Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire known for its grandeur and influence, yet it was also marked by idolatry and moral corruption. The attempt to "heal" Babylon can be seen as efforts by its allies or inhabitants to restore its former glory or avert its downfall. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of the inability of human efforts to remedy spiritual decay without divine intervention. The phrase also echoes the prophetic declarations of Babylon's inevitable destruction found in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon represents the ultimate fall of worldly systems opposed to God.<p><b>Abandon her!</b><br>This command signifies a call to separate from Babylon, both physically and spiritually. In the historical context, it was a warning to those living in Babylon to flee before its impending destruction. Spiritually, it serves as a metaphor for believers to distance themselves from sinful practices and worldly influences. This call to "come out" is reiterated in <a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>, where God's people are urged to leave Babylon to avoid sharing in her sins and plagues. It underscores the necessity of holiness and separation from evil in the life of a believer.<p><b>Let each of us go to his own land,</b><br>This phrase suggests a return to one's origins or homeland, indicating a dispersal of people who had been living in Babylon. Historically, this could refer to the exiles and foreigners who had settled in Babylon during its period of dominance. Theologically, it can symbolize a return to one's spiritual roots or a call to return to God. The idea of returning to one's land is reminiscent of the Israelites' return from Babylonian captivity, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>, where God promises to bring His people back to their land after 70 years of exile.<p><b>for her judgment extends to the sky and reaches to the clouds.</b><br>This imagery of judgment reaching the sky emphasizes the completeness and inevitability of Babylon's downfall. It suggests that Babylon's sins are so great that they have reached the heavens, warranting divine retribution. This hyperbolic language is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the magnitude of sin and the certainty of God's judgment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a> regarding Sodom and Gomorrah. The phrase also highlights the justice of God, who sees all and will not leave sin unpunished. It serves as a warning of the consequences of pride and rebellion against God, reinforcing the message that no power, however great, can withstand divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A significant empire in biblical history, known for its power and eventual downfall due to its pride and idolatry.

When God decrees final collapse, no policy, treaty, or reform can stop it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abandon her!</b><p>&#8226; This is not cold indifference but a lifesaving alarm. Earlier Jeremiah had pleaded, &#8220;Flee from Babylon; run for your lives!&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/51-6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Revelation repeats the call: &#8220;Come out of her, My people, so that you will not share in her sins&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience here means decisive separation from a system under judgment&#8212;whether physical departure for the ancient hearers or a moral/spiritual exit for believers today (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let each of us go to his own land</b><p>&#8226; Foreign merchants, diplomats, and exiles were urged to leave before the siege tightened (<a href="/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>).<p>&#8226; For Judah&#8217;s captives this hinted at homecoming: God would soon &#8220;stir up the spirit of Cyrus&#8221; to send them back (<a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The line underscores personal responsibility; no one could hide behind Babylon&#8217;s walls and claim ignorance once the warning sounded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for her judgment extends to the sky</b><p>&#8226; Like the builders of Babel who said, &#8220;Come, let us build ourselves a city&#8230; with its top in the heavens&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>), Babylon&#8217;s sins stacked higher than its ziggurats.<p>&#8226; Sodom&#8217;s outcry had once &#8220;reached&#8221; the LORD (<a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20</a>); now Babylon&#8217;s verdict does the same (<a href="/revelation/18-5.htm">Revelation 18:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The image conveys total exposure&#8212;nothing is hidden from the Judge of all the earth (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and reaches to the clouds</b><p>&#8226; The parallel phrase intensifies the picture: guilt piled so high it pierces the very realm once thought unreachable (<a href="/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Nebuchadnezzar had boasted, &#8220;Is this not Babylon the great I have built?&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>), so the city&#8217;s arrogance boomerangs into a sentence lifted &#8220;to the skies.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The finality is unmistakable: when judgment is this elevated, no counterclaim, appeal, or earthly power can lower it (<a href="/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a> lays out a sobering sequence: earnest but futile attempts to reform Babylon, an urgent call to separate, and the divine verdict towering to heaven.

For God&#8217;s people the mandate is clear&#8212;leave the doomed system, return to the place of covenant blessing, and trust the Lord who always fulfills His word, both in warning and in rescue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/51.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">We would have healed Babylon . . .</span>--This is the dramatic answer of the Israelite exiles to the prophet's appeal. They have done what they could, but all was in vain. The guilt could not be washed away, the punishment could not be averted. The "judgment" is measureless as is the distance from heaven to earth. This is also reproduced in <a href="/revelation/18-5.htm" title="For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.">Revelation 18:5</a>. For the phrase, as applied to Nebuchadnezzar, see <a href="/daniel/4-20.htm" title="The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;">Daniel 4:20</a>. Possibly there may be an allusive reference to the tower of Babel, "reaching unto heaven," as the type of Babylonian greatness (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm" title="And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.">Genesis 11:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We would have healed Babylon.</span> Experience shows that it is useless to attempt to correct such inveterate evils. <span class="cmt_word">Everyone into his own country</span> (as <a href="/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Her judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her punishment.
