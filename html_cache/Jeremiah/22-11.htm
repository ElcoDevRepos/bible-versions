In the prophetic books, such declarations often precede a message of judgment or hope. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting the seriousness of the message.<p><b>concerning Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah</b><br>Shallum is another name for Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah. He reigned for only three months before being deposed by Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt. This reference situates the prophecy in a specific historical context, during a time of political instability following Josiah's death. Josiah was a reformer king, and his death marked a turning point for Judah, leading to a rapid decline.<p><b>who succeeded his father Josiah</b><br>Jehoahaz's succession to the throne was short-lived, and his reign did not continue the reforms of his father. This transition highlights the contrast between Josiah's faithfulness and the subsequent unfaithfulness of his successors. The brevity of Jehoahaz's reign is a testament to the political turmoil and divine judgment upon Judah.<p><b>but has gone forth from this place</b><br>This phrase indicates Jehoahaz's removal from Jerusalem and Judah. Historically, he was taken captive to Egypt by Pharaoh Necho II. This removal signifies the loss of God's protection and the beginning of Judah's subjugation to foreign powers, a theme prevalent in the prophetic literature.<p><b>&#8220;He will never return,&#8221;</b><br>The finality of this statement underscores the irreversible nature of God's judgment on Jehoahaz. It also serves as a warning to the people of Judah about the consequences of disobedience. This prophecy was fulfilled as Jehoahaz died in Egypt, never returning to his homeland. Theologically, it reflects the broader theme of exile and the loss of God's favor due to covenant unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shallum.htm">Shallum (Jehoahaz)</a></b><br>Also known as Jehoahaz, Shallum was the son of King Josiah and briefly reigned as king of Judah.

Such changes were common at the time, as in the case of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.">2Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm" title="And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.">2Kings 24:17</a>). Shallum (= retribution) might probably have seemed a name of evil augury. In <a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1Chronicles 3:15</a> a Shallum appears as the fourth son of Josiah, Jehoiakim being the second, and one otherwise unknown, Johanan, the eldest. This may have been the same as the one now referred to (the order of the last two names being in some way inverted), or there may have been two brothers bearing the same name. The short and disastrous reign of Shallum, and the meaning of the word probably account for the prophet's using the private rather than the kingly name. The fact that the name had been borne by one of the later kings of Israel whose reign lasted but for a single month (<a href="/2_kings/15-13.htm" title="Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.">2Kings 15:13</a>) may have given a further point to its use, as being full of disastrous memories that made it ominous of evil.
