Historically, the Israelites were chosen to be a light to the nations, exemplifying God's laws and statutes (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5-8</a>). The call to "diligently learn" suggests a thorough and sincere effort to understand and live by these divine principles. This reflects the broader biblical theme of transformation and renewal, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, where believers are urged to be transformed by the renewing of their minds.<p><b>and swear by My name,</b><br>Swearing by God's name indicates a commitment to truth and allegiance to Him. In ancient Israel, oaths were taken seriously and were a way to invoke God's authority and presence (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>). This practice contrasts with swearing by other deities, which was common among surrounding nations. The emphasis here is on exclusive devotion to Yahweh, aligning with the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>saying, &#8216;As surely as the LORD lives&#8217;&#8212;</b><br>This phrase is a common oath formula in the Old Testament, affirming the reality and sovereignty of God (<a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>). It underscores the belief in God's active presence and involvement in the world. The phrase also serves as a declaration of faith, similar to the New Testament confession that Jesus is Lord (<a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>).<p><b>just as they once taught My people to swear by Baal&#8212;</b><br>Baal worship was a significant issue in Israel's history, often leading the people away from God (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>). This reference highlights the past influence of pagan practices on the Israelites, which led to idolatry and spiritual decline. The comparison serves as a warning and a call to repentance, echoing the prophetic messages found throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>).<p><b>then they will be established among My people.</b><br>This promise of being "established" signifies acceptance and integration into the community of God's people. It reflects the biblical theme of inclusion and restoration, as seen in the prophetic vision of nations coming to worship the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>). This also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the Gentiles being grafted into the spiritual family of God (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>), emphasizing God's redemptive plan for all humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, often warning them of impending judgment due to their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who desires His people to follow His ways and commands, and who is the ultimate authority and judge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often rebuked by Jeremiah for their idolatry and failure to follow God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal.htm">Baal</a></b><br>A Canaanite deity that the Israelites were often tempted to worship, representing a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding nations that influenced Israel and Judah, often leading them into idolatry and away from the worship of the true God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_learning_god's_ways.htm">The Importance of Learning God's Ways</a></b><br>God desires that all people, including those outside of Israel, learn and adopt His ways.

To acknowledge Jehovah in all the most solemn forms of adjuration (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/5-2.htm" title="And though they say, The LORD lives; surely they swear falsely.">Jeremiah 5:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-11.htm" title="But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.">Psalm 63:11</a>), and to do this, not hypocritically, but in the spirit of reverence and righteousness, was the ideal state of the restored Judah. To be led by her example of faith and holiness, instead of leading her to acknowledge Baal by like forms of speech as they had done, was the ideal state of the nations round about her. In this hope the prophet was echoing that of <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="/micah/4-2.htm" title="And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Micah 4:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Israel has been converted and restored, and if the other nations follow his example and <span class="cmt_word">swear by my name</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> adopt the religion of Jehovah (comp. <a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>), they shall be rewarded by being suffered to dwell safely in Israel's midst.
