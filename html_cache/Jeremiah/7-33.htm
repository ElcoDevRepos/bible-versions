The imagery of corpses indicates a severe consequence, highlighting the seriousness of their rebellion against God. Historically, this reflects the grim reality of ancient warfare, where defeated armies often left bodies unburied, a sign of disgrace and divine disfavor.<p><b>will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth</b><br>This imagery is a common biblical motif symbolizing utter defeat and humiliation (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/17-44.htm">1 Samuel 17:44</a>). In ancient Near Eastern culture, proper burial was crucial, and the lack of it was seen as a curse. This phrase underscores the totality of God's judgment, where even the dignity of burial is denied. It also echoes the covenant curses outlined in the Mosaic Law, where disobedience leads to such dire consequences.<p><b>and there will be no one to scare them away</b><br>This indicates the complete desolation and abandonment of the people. In times of war, survivors or family members would typically protect the bodies of the dead from scavengers. The absence of anyone to perform this role suggests total destruction and captivity, leaving the land desolate. This phrase also emphasizes the thoroughness of God's judgment, as there will be no remnant left to care for the dead, reflecting the severity of the people's sin and the resulting divine wrath.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
