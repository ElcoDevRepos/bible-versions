The imagery of a "fortified city" suggests impenetrability and resilience. In ancient times, fortified cities were centers of security and defense, often surrounded by thick walls and strong gates. This metaphor indicates that Jeremiah will be protected against opposition. The concept of God making someone like a fortified city is reminiscent of God's promises of protection to other prophets and leaders, such as Moses and Joshua, emphasizing divine empowerment.<p><b>an iron pillar</b><br>The "iron pillar" symbolizes strength and stability. Iron was a valuable and strong metal in ancient times, often used for tools and weapons. This imagery suggests that Jeremiah will be unyielding and steadfast in his mission. The use of iron also implies durability and the ability to withstand pressure, reflecting the prophet's role in delivering God's message despite opposition. This can be connected to the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to stand firm in their faith (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>).<p><b>and bronze walls</b><br>Bronze, like iron, was a symbol of strength and endurance. Bronze walls would be resistant to attack and decay, indicating that Jeremiah's prophetic ministry would be enduring and resilient. In the ancient Near East, bronze was used for making strong and durable items, including armor and shields. This metaphor reinforces the idea that Jeremiah will be protected and his message will endure. The imagery of bronze can also be seen in the description of the heavenly beings in <a href="/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>, symbolizing divine strength and glory.<p><b>against the whole land&#8212;against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land</b><br>Jeremiah's mission is comprehensive, facing opposition from all levels of society. The "kings of Judah" refers to the political leadership, while "its officials" and "its priests" indicate the administrative and religious authorities. "The people of the land" encompasses the general populace. This highlights the widespread resistance Jeremiah would encounter, as his messages often called for repentance and warned of impending judgment. The opposition from these groups underscores the societal corruption and spiritual decline of Judah at the time. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of prophets facing resistance, as seen in the ministries of Elijah, Isaiah, and even Jesus Christ, who faced opposition from religious and political leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

The assurance is two-fold: resistance is inevitable, but so is preservation.

The prophet is represented as attacked by kings, princes, priests, and people, as the cities of Judah are by the invading armies. But the issue is different. They fall: he will hold out. The iron pillar is that which, rising in the centre of an Eastern house or temple (as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="/judges/16-25.htm" title="And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.

The plural is used instead of a collective term for the whole circle of fortifications. In the parallel passage (<a href="/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>) the singular occurs; the same alternation of plural and singular as in <a href="/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>. The combination of figures strikingly expresses the invincibility of one whose strength is in his God. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of Judah</span>. Why the plural? Most reply, Because Jeremiah would have to do with successive sovereigns. But this meaning would have been just as well conveyed by the singular: "the king of Judah," without any name being added - would moan the king who from time to time happened to be reigning.
