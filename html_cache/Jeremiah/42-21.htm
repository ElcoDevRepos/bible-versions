Jeremiah, as a prophet, often delivered messages that required immediate attention and action. The context here is post-exilic, where the remnant of Judah is seeking guidance after the fall of Jerusalem. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to convey God's will directly to the people, highlighting the importance of listening to prophetic voices.<p><b>but you have not obeyed</b><br>Disobedience is a recurring theme in the history of Israel. The Israelites frequently struggled with following God's commands, leading to consequences such as exile. This phrase underscores the people's persistent rebellion and the human tendency to resist divine instruction. It reflects the broader biblical narrative of humanity's struggle with sin and the need for repentance.<p><b>the voice of the LORD your God</b><br>The "voice of the LORD" signifies divine authority and the personal relationship between God and His people. In the Old Testament, God's voice is often associated with His commandments and guidance. This phrase reminds the audience of the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God spoke directly to the Israelites, and they agreed to follow His laws.<p><b>in all He has sent me to tell you</b><br>Jeremiah's role as a messenger is emphasized here. Prophets were chosen by God to deliver His messages, often facing opposition and persecution. This phrase highlights the completeness and sufficiency of God's revelation through His prophets. It also points to the responsibility of the people to heed the entire message, not just parts of it. This can be connected to the New Testament, where Jesus is seen as the ultimate prophet and messenger of God's will, fulfilling and expanding upon the messages of the Old Testament prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
