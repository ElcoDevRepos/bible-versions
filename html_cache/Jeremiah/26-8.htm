This phrase indicates the immediacy and urgency of Jeremiah's prophetic mission. The phrase "everything the LORD had commanded him to say" underscores the divine authority behind Jeremiah's words, emphasizing that he was not speaking on his own behalf but as a mouthpiece for God. This reflects the role of prophets in the Old Testament, who were often tasked with delivering difficult messages of warning and repentance. Jeremiah's faithfulness in delivering God's message, despite the personal risk, is a testament to his obedience and courage.<p><b>the priests and prophets and all the people seized him</b><br>The reaction of the priests and prophets, along with the people, highlights the tension between Jeremiah and the religious establishment. The priests and prophets mentioned here were likely those who were aligned with the temple and the king, often opposing Jeremiah's messages of impending judgment. This reflects a broader theme in the Old Testament where true prophets of God often faced opposition from false prophets and religious leaders who were more concerned with maintaining their own power and status. The act of seizing Jeremiah indicates the hostility and rejection he faced, which is a common experience for many prophets, including Jesus Christ, who was also rejected by the religious leaders of His time.<p><b>shouting, &#8220;You must surely die!&#8221;</b><br>The demand for Jeremiah's death reveals the severity of the opposition he faced. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Judah, blasphemy or speaking against the temple and the city could be considered a capital offense. The phrase "You must surely die" echoes the legal language found in the Mosaic Law, where certain offenses were punishable by death. This reaction also foreshadows the treatment of Jesus Christ, who was similarly condemned by the religious leaders of His day. The hostility towards Jeremiah serves as a type of Christ, illustrating the pattern of rejection and persecution faced by those who faithfully deliver God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often facing opposition and persecution for his prophecies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Judah who were responsible for temple worship and maintaining the spiritual life of the nation.

The "people" appear to have been always under some constraint. As long as the priests and prophets were alone, they dominated the unofficial classes, but when the princes appeared (ver. 11), the new influence proved superior. In ver. 16 princes and people together go over to the side of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely die</span>. Death was the legal penalty both for blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>) and for presuming to prophesy without having received a prophetic revelation (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>). Jeremiah's declaration ran so entirely counter to the prejudices of his hearers that he may well have been accused of both these sins, or crimes. True, Isaiah and Amos had already predicted the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5, 6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a>; <a href="/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1, 2</a>); but it may have been contended that the timely repentance of Judah under Hezekiah and Josiah had effectually cancelled the threatened doom, and though <a href="/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a> evidently refers to a time later than Josiah, and represents the ruin of Jerusalem as practically certain, it would seem that the prophetic book (<a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>.) to which this belongs (to say the least) was not generally known. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and as soon as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;
