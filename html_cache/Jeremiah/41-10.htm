Mizpah was a significant location in the territory of Benjamin, serving as a center of governance after the fall of Jerusalem. The remnant refers to those left behind after the Babylonian conquest, indicating a vulnerable group. This act of taking captives reflects the political instability and treachery during this period.<p><b>the daughters of the king along with all the others who remained in Mizpah</b><br>The mention of the "daughters of the king" suggests that members of the royal family were still present in Mizpah, possibly as hostages or under protection. This highlights the continued influence and importance of the Davidic line, even in exile. The inclusion of "all the others" indicates that Ishmael's actions affected a broad spectrum of society, emphasizing the widespread impact of his betrayal.<p><b>over whom Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam</b><br>Nebuzaradan was a high-ranking Babylonian official, and his appointment of Gedaliah as governor shows Babylon's strategy of using local leaders to maintain control. Gedaliah, known for his loyalty to Babylon and his efforts to stabilize the region, was a son of Ahikam, who had protected the prophet Jeremiah. This connection underscores the intertwining of political and prophetic narratives in Judah's history.<p><b>Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive</b><br>Ishmael's lineage is significant, as he was of royal descent, which may have fueled his ambition and sense of entitlement. His actions can be seen as a power grab, driven by personal and political motives. This act of taking captives is a direct challenge to Babylonian authority and Gedaliah's leadership, reflecting the ongoing conflict and division among the people of Judah.<p><b>and set off to cross over to the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were traditional enemies of Israel, located east of the Jordan River. Ishmael's intention to flee to them suggests a betrayal not only of his people but also of his heritage. This move indicates a strategic alliance with foreign powers, highlighting the complex political landscape of the time. The Ammonites' involvement points to the broader regional dynamics and the constant threat of external influence on Judah's remnant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael_son_of_nethaniah.htm">Ishmael son of Nethaniah</a></b><br>A member of the royal family and one of the officers of the king of Judah.
