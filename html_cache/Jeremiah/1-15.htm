The "north" refers to Babylon, which, although geographically east, would invade from the north due to the topography and trade routes. This aligns with historical records of Babylon's rise to power under Nebuchadnezzar. The summoning of these kingdoms fulfills earlier prophecies of judgment against Judah for their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6, 6</a>:22). The phrase underscores God's authority over geopolitical events, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p><b>Their kings will come and set up their thrones at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem.</b><br>The imagery of setting up thrones at the gates signifies conquest and judgment. In ancient cities, gates were central to civic life, serving as places for legal matters and public announcements. The presence of foreign kings at Jerusalem's gates symbolizes the city's subjugation and the loss of its autonomy. This prophecy was fulfilled during the Babylonian siege and eventual destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC (<a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-4</a>). The gates, once a place of strength and decision-making, become a symbol of defeat and foreign rule.<p><b>They will attack all her surrounding walls and all the other cities of Judah.</b><br>The mention of "surrounding walls" highlights the comprehensive nature of the impending judgment. Jerusalem's walls, meant for protection, would be breached, signifying the city's vulnerability and the failure of human defenses against divine judgment. The reference to "all the other cities of Judah" indicates that the devastation would not be limited to Jerusalem but would extend throughout the nation, affecting both urban and rural areas. This widespread destruction is documented in the accounts of the Babylonian campaigns (<a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>).

And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.">2Samuel 15:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/127-5.htm" title="Happy is the man that has his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.">Psalm 127:5</a>). In <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a> we have a literal fulfilment of the prediction.<p><span class= "bld">Against all the walls.</span>--As the previous words speak of a formal usurpation of power, so do these of invasion and attack, the storming of the lesser cities of Judah, while Jerusalem became the centre of the foreign government.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will call</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I am calling</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. I am about to call. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdoms of the north</span>; alluding possibly to the varied origin of the population of Assyria and Babylonia. But more probably it is simply a suggestive phrase, for the wide extent of the hostile empire referred to (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall set every one his throne</span>, etc. The kings, or. the, generals, representing "all the families, etc., shall set up the high seat of power and judicial authority at the broad space within the gate of the city, which constituted the Oriental forum (comp. <a href="/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>; <a href="/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>; <a href="/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21</a>). Thither the besieged would have to come to surrender themselves (<a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>) and to hear their fate. A similar prediction is made with regard to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9, 10</a>). It is true the seat of authority is there said to be placed at the entrance of the palace, but this was in fact another place where justice was wont to be administered (<a href="/jeremiah/22-2.htm">Jeremiah 22:2, 3</a>). Jerome's view, adopted by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Nagelsbach, that "to set one's seat" means "to besiege" is against usage, and does not accord with the opening words of ver. 16. There is, however, an element of truth in it. The judgment executed ministerially by the northern kings or generals began with the siege of Jerusalem and the other cities, and hence the words with which the prophet continues. <span class="cmt_word">And against all the walls</span>, etc. We should have expected something like "and shall set themselves in array against," etc. (comp. <a href="/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a> b);
