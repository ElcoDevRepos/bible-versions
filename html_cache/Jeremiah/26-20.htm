The act of prophesying in the name of the LORD indicates that Uriah claimed divine authority for his messages. This reflects the biblical principle that true prophets speak not from their own authority but as messengers of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-22</a>). The presence of multiple prophets during this period highlights the seriousness of the message God was delivering to Judah.<p><b>Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim</b><br>Uriah is identified by his lineage and hometown, which was a common practice to establish identity and credibility. Kiriath-jearim was a town in the territory of Judah, known for its association with the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). This geographical detail situates Uriah within the cultural and religious landscape of Judah, emphasizing that he was a local prophet with a vested interest in the fate of his people.<p><b>He prophesied against this city and against this land</b><br>Uriah's message was directed against Jerusalem and the land of Judah, similar to Jeremiah's prophecies. This indicates that Uriah's message was one of warning and impending judgment, consistent with the themes of the prophetic literature of the time. The focus on "this city" and "this land" underscores the specific and localized nature of the prophetic warnings, which were often tied to the covenantal relationship between God and Israel (Leviticus 26, <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>).<p><b>the same things that Jeremiah did</b><br>This phrase highlights the consistency of the prophetic message delivered by both Uriah and Jeremiah. It suggests that Uriah's prophecies were in alignment with the warnings of destruction and calls for repentance that Jeremiah was known for. This consistency serves to reinforce the validity of the prophetic message, as it was not isolated to a single voice but confirmed by multiple prophets. Theologically, this reflects the principle that God often confirms His word through multiple witnesses (<a href="/2_corinthians/13.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_son_of_shemaiah.htm">Uriah son of Shemaiah</a></b><br>A prophet who, like Jeremiah, spoke against Jerusalem and Judah.

A man from this spiritually significant locale preaching repentance highlights Judah&#8217;s responsibility to heed God.<p>- Mentioning his father, Shemaiah, follows the biblical pattern of rooting ministry in concrete family lines, affirming both authenticity and accountability (<a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23-38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He prophesied against this city and against this land</b><p>- Like Jeremiah, Uriah&#8217;s message targeted both Jerusalem (&#8220;this city&#8221;) and the broader nation (&#8220;this land&#8221;), calling out systemic sin (<a href="/jeremiah/7-1.htm">Jeremiah 7:1-7</a>; <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8-12</a>).<p>- &#8220;Against&#8221; signals warning: impending judgment unless repentance occurs (<a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s love is displayed in warning before disciplining (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the same things that Jeremiah did</b><p>- Agreement validates the prophecy: two independent voices deliver identical warnings, confirming God&#8217;s unchanging standard (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22-23</a>).<p>- The verse implicitly rebukes those who dismissed Jeremiah: rejecting Uriah too removes the excuse of singling out one prophet (<a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>).<p>- Sadly, verses 21-23 reveal Uriah was executed, illustrating the cost of faithfulness and foreshadowing opposition faced by later servants, including Christ Himself (<a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-39</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36-38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20</a> introduces Uriah as a corroborating witness who, empowered by God&#8217;s authority, delivered the same hard truth Jeremiah proclaimed. His rooted identity, identical message, and subsequent martyrdom stress that Judah&#8217;s problem was not misunderstanding but defiance of clear, repeated warnings. The verse assures us that God faithfully raises multiple voices to affirm His Word, and it challenges readers today to heed Scripture promptly, lest repeated mercy be met with persistent unbelief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And there was also a man that prophesied . . .</span>--The verses that follow, seeing that they state a fact which tends in the opposite direction, cannot be regarded as part of the argument of the "elders" of <a href="/jeremiah/26-17.htm" title="Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,">Jeremiah 26:17</a>. Nor is there any sufficient reason for supposing, in the absence of any statement to that effect, that the case of Urijah was alleged in a counter-argument by the priests and prophets. <a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a> shows rather that Jeremiah, or the compiler of the book, wished to record the fact that he did not stand absolutely alone, and that at least one prophet had been, as an Abdiel,--"faithful found among the faithless,"--who had courage to follow his example. He took up the strain of Jeremiah, and reproduced it. Of this Urijah we know nothing beyond what is here recorded. It is, perhaps, worth noting that the history of his native place may in some measure have influenced his thoughts, as presenting, like Shiloh, the history of a sacred place that had lost its sanctity (<a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.">1Samuel 7:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm" title="And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwells between the cherubim.">2Samuel 6:2</a>), and that its position on the border of the tribe of Benjamin may have brought him into contact with the prophet of Anathoth. The distance between the two towns was but a short day's journey.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - The murder of the prophet Urijah. At first sight, these four verses appear to belong to the speech of the elders, but the appearance is delusive, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the issue of the affair of Urijah cannot possibly have taken place "in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim" (ver. 1); and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because the passage stands in no connection with what precedes, whereas it is related, and that very closely, to ver. 24 (see below). The case is similar to that of certain passages in St. John's Gospel, where the reflections of the evangelist are put side by side with the sayings of our <span class="accented">Lord</span>. Jeremiah, writing down his experiences at a later time, introduces the story of Urijah to show the magnitude of the danger to which he had been exposed. The notice of Urijah has an additional importance, as it shows incidentally how isolated a spiritual prophet like Jeremiah was, and how completely the order of prophets had fallen below its high ideal. We have no further knowledge of the prophet Urijah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kirjath-jearim</span>; a city in the territory of Judah, on the west frontier of Benjamin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">another man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">prophesying</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7791;&#183;nab&#183;b&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5012.htm">Strong's 5012: </a> </span><span class="str2">To prophesy, speak, by inspiration</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the name</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
