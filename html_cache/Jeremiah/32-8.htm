It reflects the prophetic nature of Jeremiah's ministry, where God's messages often came to pass as foretold. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His promises, as seen in <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> and <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>.<p><b>my cousin Hanamel came to me</b><br>Hanamel's visit is significant as it fulfills the prophecy given to Jeremiah. The mention of a family member underscores the importance of kinship and familial obligations in ancient Israelite society. This reflects the Levitical laws regarding property and inheritance, where family members had the first right to redeem land (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>).<p><b>in the courtyard of the guard</b><br>Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guard, indicating the political and social turmoil of the time. This setting reflects the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem and the prophet's imprisonment by King Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2-3</a>). It underscores the tension between Jeremiah's prophetic messages and the political authorities.<p><b>and urged me, &#8216;Please buy my field in Anathoth</b><br>Anathoth, a town in the territory of Benjamin, was Jeremiah's hometown (<a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). The request to buy the field symbolizes hope and future restoration despite the impending Babylonian exile. It serves as a prophetic act demonstrating faith in God's promise to restore Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/32-15.htm">Jeremiah 32:15</a>).<p><b>in the land of Benjamin</b><br>The land of Benjamin holds historical significance as part of the Southern Kingdom of Judah. It was strategically located and often involved in the conflicts of the region. The mention of Benjamin ties Jeremiah's personal story to the larger narrative of Israel's history and God's covenant with His people.<p><b>for you own the right of inheritance and redemption</b><br>This phrase refers to the legal and cultural practice of redeeming family property, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-34</a>. It highlights the importance of land in Israelite identity and God's provision for maintaining family inheritance. This act of redemption is a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He redeems humanity, restoring what was lost (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p><b>Buy it for yourself</b><br>The command to buy the field is a call to action, reflecting obedience to God's word. It symbolizes faith in God's promises and the future restoration of Israel. This act of purchasing the land serves as a tangible expression of hope and trust in God's plan.<p><b>Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD</b><br>Jeremiah's recognition of God's word confirms the divine origin of the message. It underscores the prophet's role as a mediator of God's will and the importance of discernment in recognizing God's voice. This acknowledgment is a testament to the authenticity and authority of prophetic revelation, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>, <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

Probably, as in the Assyrian invasion (<a href="/isaiah/10-30.htm" title="Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.">Isaiah 10:30</a>), Anathoth was occupied and ravaged by the army of the Chaldaeans, and the field seemed to its possessor little more than a <span class= "ital">damnosa h?reditas </span>("an inheritance of ruin"), which he was glad to get rid of at any price. Perhaps, too, looking to the part that Jeremiah had taken in urging submission to Nebuchadnezzar, it seemed prudent to transfer the ownership of the field to one whom the Chaldaeans were disposed to protect, while, as Jeremiah was in prison, Hanameel might well expect to remain in occupation as his representative. The words "the right of inheritance is thine" indicate that Hanameel had no children. The description "Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin," hardly natural in the lips of cousin speaking to cousin, is wanting in the LXX. version, and is traceable probably to the Jewish habit of writing in the text what with us would be notes in the margin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The right of inheritance</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">of taking</span> <span class="accented">possession</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is thine.</span> The right, however, was dependent on the previous right of redeeming the land. Hence the speaker continues: <span class="cmt_word">The redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.</span> The Law directs, "If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold" (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). Jeremiah's kinsman, however, ascribes to him the right of pre-emption. This is not mentioned in Leviticus; hut, of course, no one would care to purchase a property till he was sure that the next kinsman would not insist on redeeming it. No one, it may be remarked, could purchase land unconditionally - the usufruct of it till the year of jubilee was all that was legally transferable; and even the original occupant had only a life interest in his land, the ownership of which was, strictly speaking, vested in the commune. This seems to Be the necessary inference from a comprehensive view of the passages relative to land in the Old Testament (see Mr. Fenton's 'Early Hebrew Life; ' and an article in the <span class="accented">Church Quarterly Review</span>, July, 1880). <span class="cmt_word">Then I knew,</span> etc. We may, perhaps, interpret this notice combined with that in ver. 6 thus: Jeremiah had had a presentiment, founded, perhaps, upon the distress to which his cousin had been reduced, that the latter would invite him to carry out the provisions of the Law; and his presentiments were generally so ordered by the Divine Spirit of prophecy as to be ratified by the event. Still, he had a measure of uncertainty till Hanameel actually came to him, and so demonstrated "that this had been the word of the Lord." In recording the circumstances, he not unnaturally reflects his later feeling of certitude in his description of the presentiment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/32-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then, as the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ki&#7695;&#183;&#7687;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
