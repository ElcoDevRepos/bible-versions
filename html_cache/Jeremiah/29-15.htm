It reflects the mindset of the exiled Israelites in Babylon, who are seeking guidance and reassurance. The use of "may say" indicates a presumption or a common sentiment among the exiles. This reflects the human tendency to seek out messages that align with personal desires or circumstances, especially in times of distress.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD has raised up for us prophets in Babylon,&#8221;</b><br>The exiles in Babylon believed that God had provided them with prophets to guide them during their captivity. This belief could stem from a desire for immediate comfort and assurance of a swift return to Jerusalem. However, the context of <a href="/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a> suggests a warning against false prophets who were giving misleading messages of peace and quick deliverance, contrary to Jeremiah's message of a prolonged exile. Historically, Babylon was a center of power and culture, and the presence of prophets there could be seen as a way for the exiles to maintain their religious identity. This situation parallels other biblical instances where false prophets arose, such as in <a href="/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a> with the prophets of Ahab. Theologically, this phrase challenges the discernment of true prophecy, emphasizing the need to test messages against God's revealed word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The exiles&#8217; claim that God had supplied new prophets in Babylon sounded spiritual but masked disobedience to God&#8217;s explicit word through Jeremiah. Scripture calls us to anchor every claim of divine authority to the unchanging standard of God&#8217;s written revelation, discerning true voices from false and trusting the Lord&#8217;s timetable even when it challenges our preferences.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Because ye have said, The Lord hath raised us up prophets . . .</span>--The words point to the boast of some of the exiles, that they, too, had the guidance of prophets whom, as in <a href="/jeremiah/29-20.htm" title="Hear you therefore the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:">Jeremiah 29:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-24.htm" title="Thus shall you also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,">Jeremiah 29:24</a>, they were inclined to follow in preference to Jeremiah. In answer to that boast, he emphasises the contrast between the exiles in whom the prophet sees the future hope of his nation and the worthless king (Zedekiah) and people who had been left in Jerusalem, and for whom he foretells yet sharper sufferings. The symbolism of the "vile figs" is reproduced in <a href="/jeremiah/29-17.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.">Jeremiah 29:17</a> from <a href="/context/jeremiah/24-1.htm" title="The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 24:1-2</a>.

Some eminent critics maintain that vers. 16-20 are an interpolation, and this view is certainly supported By the omission of these verses in the Septuagint. It must also in fairness be admitted that the natural connection of ver. 15 is with ver. 21, not with ver. 16. But it does not follow that vers. 16-20 are an arbitrary interpolation. They may be regarded either as a digression in the original letter, or as inserted by an after-thought when the substance of the letter was brought into its present form. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you may say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;mar&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has raised up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1511;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for us</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1447;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
