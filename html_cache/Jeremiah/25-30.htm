This reflects the role of prophets as God's messengers, often tasked with delivering difficult truths. The context here is the impending judgment on Judah and the nations, emphasizing the seriousness of their disobedience. Prophets like Jeremiah were often met with resistance, highlighting the challenge of speaking God's truth in a rebellious world.<p><b>&#8216;The LORD will roar from on high;</b><br>The imagery of the LORD roaring suggests power and authority, akin to a lion asserting dominance. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>, to convey God's impending judgment. The "roar" signifies a divine warning that cannot be ignored, emphasizing the seriousness of the message and the certainty of its fulfillment.<p><b>He will raise His voice from His holy habitation.</b><br>God's "holy habitation" refers to heaven, His dwelling place, underscoring His sovereignty and the divine origin of the message. This phrase assures that the judgment is not from human origin but from the Creator Himself. It connects to passages like <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>, which speaks of the LORD's throne in heaven, reinforcing His omniscience and omnipotence.<p><b>He will roar loudly over His pasture;</b><br>The "pasture" symbolizes God's people, often depicted as sheep under His care. This imagery is common in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>. The loud roar over the pasture indicates a protective yet corrective action, where God addresses the sin and rebellion among His people, ensuring they understand the gravity of their situation.<p><b>like those who tread the grapes,</b><br>This simile draws on the imagery of a winepress, a common biblical metaphor for judgment (<a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>). The act of treading grapes involves crushing, symbolizing the thoroughness and inevitability of God's judgment. It reflects the process of separating the good from the bad, a theme prevalent in prophetic literature.<p><b>He will call out with a shout against all the inhabitants of the earth.</b><br>The scope of the judgment extends beyond Judah to all nations, highlighting God's universal sovereignty. This global perspective is consistent with the prophetic vision of God's ultimate plan for justice and righteousness. It connects to the eschatological themes found in books like Daniel and Revelation, where God's final judgment is portrayed as encompassing all humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Jeremiah, warning of impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_habitation.htm">The Holy Habitation</a></b><br>Refers to heaven, the dwelling place of God, from where He issues His divine decrees.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fold.htm">The Fold</a></b><br>Symbolically represents God's people, Israel, who are under His care but also subject to His judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>Represents all nations, indicating that God's judgment is not limited to Israel but extends to all who oppose Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>God's voice is powerful and authoritative, reminding us of His ultimate control over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Reality of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>This passage underscores the certainty of God's judgment against sin, calling us to live in reverence and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness.htm">God's Holiness</a></b><br>The reference to God's "holy habitation" highlights His purity and the standard to which He holds His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_repentance.htm">The Call to Repentance</a></b><br>Understanding the seriousness of God's judgment should lead us to examine our lives and turn from sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/global_scope_of_god's_judgment.htm">Global Scope of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's concern is not limited to Israel; His justice extends to all nations, reminding us of the universal need for the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_25_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 25:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_25_30_God_s_authority_today.htm">How does Jeremiah 25:30 illustrate God's authority over all nations today?

The first "habitation" is the dwelling-place of Jehovah, from which the thunders of His wrath are heard. The second is the <span class= "ital">"pasture" </span>or dwelling-place of the flock and its shepherds, as in <a href="/jeremiah/6-2.htm" title="I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.">Jeremiah 6:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm" title="Pour out your fury on the heathen that know you not, and on the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.">Jeremiah 10:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/79-7.htm" title="For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.">Psalm 79:7</a>, upon whom the storm falls. Possibly, under its association with this new word, the roaring becomes to the prophet's mind as that of the lion which attacks the flock. The same bold imagery for the Divine judgments meets us in <a href="/joel/3-16.htm" title="The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.">Joel 3:16</a>; <a href="/amos/1-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="/amos/3-8.htm" title="The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD has spoken, who can but prophesy?">Amos 3:8</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30-38.</span> - The judgment upon the world. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore prophesy thou</span>, etc. Babylon, like the smaller kingdoms which it absorbed, has fallen, and nothing remains (for nothing had been revealed to the prophet concerning an interval to elapse previously) but to picture the great assize from which no flesh should be exempt.
