The "terror" they caused refers to their aggressive and violent actions against neighboring nations, including Judah. Pride is a recurring theme in the Bible, often leading to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The Edomites' self-deception is a result of their overconfidence in their military strength and strategic location.<p><b>O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks</b><br>The Edomites lived in a mountainous region, with Petra being a notable city carved into rock cliffs. This geographical setting gave them a false sense of security, believing their natural fortifications made them invulnerable to attack. The imagery of dwelling in rock clefts symbolizes their perceived impregnability, yet it also highlights their isolation and eventual vulnerability.<p><b>O occupiers of the mountain summit</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the Edomites' strategic advantage due to their high-altitude settlements. Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize strength and stability (<a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>). However, the Edomites' reliance on their elevated position reflects their misplaced trust in earthly defenses rather than in God.<p><b>Though you elevate your nest like the eagle</b><br>The eagle is a symbol of power and freedom, often associated with high and inaccessible places (<a href="/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>). The Edomites' attempt to "elevate" themselves signifies their ambition and desire for dominance. This imagery also connects to the theme of pride, as they sought to rise above others, much like the builders of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>).<p><b>Even from there I will bring you down,&#8221; declares the LORD</b><br>This is a divine pronouncement of judgment, underscoring God's sovereignty over all nations. Despite the Edomites' efforts to secure themselves, God promises to humble them, illustrating the biblical principle that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). This prophecy was fulfilled historically when the Edomites were conquered and absorbed by other nations, demonstrating the certainty of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>The descendants of Esau, living in the region south of the Dead Sea.

The verse stands as a timeless warning: security apart from the LORD is self-deception, and pride guarantees a fall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Thy terribleness hath deceived thee.</span>--The substantive does not occur elsewhere. Etymo-logically it may mean "terror of," or "object of terror;" but a cognate word is found in <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm" title="And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.">1Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm" title="And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.">2Chronicles 15:16</a> in the sense of an "idol," probably of the Phallic or Priapus type, and that is probably the meaning. Such an idol is called scornfully the <span class= "ital">horror </span>of Edom, just as the God of Israel was <span class= "ital">"</span>the fear of Isaac" (<a href="/genesis/31-42.htm" title="Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely you had sent me away now empty.

So Milton speaks of Chemosh as the "obscene <span class= "ital">dread </span>of Moab's sons" (<span class= "ital">Par. Lost, </span>I. 406.)<p><span class= "bld">O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">in the fortresses of Sela. </span>The words describe with a wonderful vividness the aspect of the rock-fortresses of Edom, the cities built into a ravine. The remains of Petra (the Sela of <a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-1.htm" title="Send you the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.">Isaiah 16:1</a>), commonly referred to as illustrating this description, are, it must be remembered, of Roman origin; but there can be little doubt that it occupied the site of an earlier city, and that there were other fortresses, even more like the eagle's nest, perched upon the summit of the crags. In <a href="/context/job/39-27.htm" title="Does the eagle mount up at your command, and make her nest on high?">Job 39:27-30</a> we have a picture of the eagle's nest drawn by a writer who was probably familiar with these rock fortresses. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy terribleness.</span> This is certainly the best rendering of this <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.
