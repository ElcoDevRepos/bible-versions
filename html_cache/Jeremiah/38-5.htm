Jeremiah was often found in the court of the guard, a place where he was confined but still accessible. His presence here signifies his role as a prophet who was consistently available to deliver God's messages, despite opposition and personal risk.<p><b>replied King Zedekiah.</b><br>King Zedekiah was the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile. His reign was marked by political instability and pressure from both Babylon and Egypt. Zedekiah's interactions with Jeremiah reveal his internal conflict and weakness as a leader. Despite recognizing Jeremiah as a prophet, Zedekiah often vacillated between listening to him and succumbing to the demands of his officials.<p><b>He is in your hands,</b><br>This statement reflects Zedekiah's relinquishment of authority over Jeremiah to his officials. It highlights the king's lack of resolve and his tendency to yield to the pressures of his court. This phrase also underscores the political dynamics of the time, where the king's power was often undermined by influential advisors and officials.<p><b>since the king can do nothing to stop you.</b><br>Zedekiah's admission of powerlessness is significant. It illustrates his inability to protect Jeremiah, despite knowing the prophet's divine mandate. This phrase also reflects the broader theme of divine sovereignty versus human authority, a recurring motif in the book of Jeremiah. Zedekiah's weakness foreshadows the impending judgment and fall of Jerusalem, as prophesied by Jeremiah. This situation can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, like Jeremiah, was handed over to authorities despite being innocent, fulfilling God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_zedekiah.htm">King Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of the Babylonian siege.
