While God is just and righteous, His anger is not eternal. The Bible consistently portrays God as patient and merciful, willing to forgive those who repent (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8-9</a>). The rhetorical question highlights the tension between God's justice and His mercy, emphasizing that His anger is a response to persistent sin rather than a permanent state.<p><b>Will He be indignant to the end?</b><br>Indignation here refers to God's righteous anger towards sin. The Israelites are questioning whether God's displeasure will persist indefinitely. This reflects a lack of understanding of God's covenantal promises, where He assures restoration upon repentance (<a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7-8</a>). The question underscores the need for genuine repentance to restore the relationship with God.<p><b>This you have spoken,</b><br>This phrase indicates that the people of Israel have verbally acknowledged God's displeasure. It suggests a superficial recognition of their wrongdoing without a corresponding change in behavior. This mirrors the frequent biblical theme where God's people acknowledge Him with their lips, but their hearts remain distant (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>but you keep doing all the evil you can.</b><br>Despite their acknowledgment, the Israelites continue in their sinful ways. This highlights the theme of hypocrisy and the danger of empty words without true repentance. The persistent sinfulness of Israel is a recurring issue throughout the prophetic books, where God calls for a transformation of heart and actions (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9-10</a>). This phrase serves as a warning that mere acknowledgment of sin is insufficient without a genuine turning away from evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often rebuked by God through the prophets for their idolatry and unfaithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, expressing His disappointment with Judah's persistent sinfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Often referenced in Jeremiah as a nation that has turned away from God, serving as a warning to Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_rebuke.htm">Prophetic Rebuke</a></b><br>The event of God, through Jeremiah, confronting the people of Judah about their sin and false assumptions about His patience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_justice.htm">God's Patience and Justice</a></b><br>God's patience is immense, but it is not infinite.

Yet this question reveals more about the people than about the Lord.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that God&#8217;s anger is real but purposeful, aimed at bringing His people to repentance (<a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7-8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; They assume time alone will cool divine displeasure, forgetting that genuine repentance is what shortens discipline (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse invites us to recognize that God&#8217;s patience does not cancel His holiness; He waits, but He also warns (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will He be indignant to the end?</b><p>Here the people test the limits of God&#8217;s righteous indignation.<p>&#8226; The question carries an undercurrent of presumption&#8212;&#8220;Surely God won&#8217;t stay upset forever, so we can hold off on changing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet passages like <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a> and <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a> remind us that prolonged mercy is meant to lead to repentance, not to enable sin.<p>&#8226; God does not cherish anger; He delights in steadfast love (<a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>). Still, unrepentant hearts will feel His indignation &#8220;to the end&#8221; if they refuse His grace (<a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This you have spoken</b><p>Jeremiah exposes the disconnect between Judah&#8217;s words and deeds.<p>&#8226; Lip service sounds spiritual&#8212;asking doctrinal questions, mouthing pious phrases&#8212;but the heart may remain unmoved (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The people&#8217;s speech acknowledges God&#8217;s justice, yet it stops short of surrender.

Judah asks whether divine anger will really last, hoping time alone will ease judgment. The Lord, however, points out their empty words and ongoing sin. His righteous indignation remains while rebellion continues, yet His purpose is always redemptive. True relief from His anger comes not through waiting it out but through wholehearted repentance and obedience, the doorway to restored fellowship and lasting peace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Will he reserve his anger for ever . . .</span>?--The questions were such as might well be asked in the first burst of sorrowing though superficial repentance. The implied answer was in the negative, "No, He will not keep His anger to the end." Yet, so far, facts were against that yearning hope. It will be noted that the word "anger" is not in the Hebrew. It is, however, rightly inserted, after the precedent of <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm" title="God is jealous, and the LORD revenges; the LORD revenges, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves wrath for his enemies.">Nahum 1:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-9.htm" title="He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.">Psalm 103:9</a>.
