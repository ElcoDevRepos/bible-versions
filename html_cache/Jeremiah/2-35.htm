This reflects a common human tendency to deny wrongdoing, reminiscent of Adam and Eve's initial reactions in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The claim of innocence is a self-deception, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/30-12.htm">Proverbs 30:12</a>, where a generation is described as pure in their own eyes yet not cleansed of their filth.<p><b>Surely His anger will turn from me.&#8217;</b><br>Here, the people presume upon God's mercy, expecting that His anger will dissipate without true repentance. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's justice and holiness, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God is described as merciful but also just. The presumption of divine leniency without repentance is a recurring theme, as in <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4-5</a>, where Paul warns against taking God's kindness for granted.<p><b>Behold, I will judge you,</b><br>God's response is a declaration of impending judgment, emphasizing His role as the righteous judge. This aligns with the consistent biblical theme that God will judge sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a> and <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>. The certainty of divine judgment is a call to accountability, contrasting human denial with divine truth.<p><b>because you say, &#8216;I have not sinned.&#8217;</b><br>The repetition of the people's denial highlights their stubbornness and self-righteousness. This echoes the Pharisees' attitude in the New Testament, who claimed righteousness while rejecting Jesus (<a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9-14</a>). The denial of sin is a barrier to receiving God's grace, as 1 <a href="/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8-10</a> teaches that confession is necessary for forgiveness.
