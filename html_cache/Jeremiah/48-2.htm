Historically, Moab was often in conflict with Israel, yet it was also known for its wealth and fertile land. The phrase indicates a loss of status and respect, suggesting divine judgment. Moab's pride and idolatry are condemned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8-11</a>, highlighting a consistent biblical theme of God humbling the proud.<p><b>in Heshbon they devise evil against her:</b><br>Heshbon was a significant city in Moab, originally an Amorite city captured by the Israelites (<a href="/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25-30</a>). It later became a strategic location for Moab. The devising of evil in Heshbon suggests a plot or conspiracy against Moab, possibly by its enemies or as a divine judgment. This reflects the biblical principle that God uses nations to execute His judgment, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5-11</a>.<p><b>&#8216;Come, let us cut her off from nationhood.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase indicates a complete destruction or removal of Moab as a nation, a common theme in prophetic literature where God judges nations for their sins. The call to cut off Moab echoes the fate of other nations judged by God, such as Babylon (Isaiah 13) and Edom (Obadiah). It underscores the sovereignty of God over nations and His ability to raise and depose them according to His will.<p><b>You too, O people of Madmen, will be silenced;</b><br>Madmen is a lesser-known location, possibly a Moabite town. The silencing of its people signifies total destruction or cessation of its influence. This reflects the broader theme of divine retribution against those who oppose God's people or His purposes. The silencing can also be seen as a metaphor for the cessation of idolatrous practices, as God often silences false worship (<a href="/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a>).<p><b>the sword will pursue you.</b><br>The sword is a common biblical symbol for war and judgment. In this context, it represents the impending military defeat and destruction of Moab. The pursuit by the sword indicates relentless judgment, similar to the fate of other nations that opposed Israel, such as the Philistines (<a href="/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-8</a>). This phrase emphasizes the inevitability of divine judgment and the futility of resisting God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

The passage declares, with literal finality, that every layer of Moabite pride, security, and population will succumb to God&#8217;s sovereign judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">There shall be no more praise of Moab.--</span>The self-glorifying boasts of Moab (of which the Moabite Inscription discovered at Diban in 1868 is a conspicuous instance, see Ginsburg's <span class= "ital">Moabite Stone </span>and <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, xi.</span> p. 163) seem to have been almost proverbial (<a href="/jeremiah/48-29.htm" title="We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogance, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.">Jeremiah 48:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm" title="We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.">Isaiah 16:6</a>). Heshbon (the city is perhaps chosen on account of the similarity of sound with the word for "devise ") was on the Ammonite or northern frontier of Moab (<a href="/jeremiah/49-3.htm" title="Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>), and is represented therefore as the scene of the plans and hopes of the invading Chaldaeans. The site of Madmen is unknown, but the cognate form Madmenah is translated "dunghill" in <a href="/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10</a>, and may have been chosen by each prophet on account of its ignominious meaning. The name appears as belonging to a town in Benjamin (<a href="/isaiah/10-31.htm" title="Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.">Isaiah 10:31</a>) and in Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-31.htm" title="And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,">Joshua 15:31</a>). Here again there is an obvious assonance or paronomasia, the verb "thou shalt be cut down," or better, <span class= "ital">thou shalt be brought to silence, </span>reproducing the chief consonants of the noun. The LXX., Vulgate, and Syriac, indeed, take the words with this meaning, "In silence thou shalt be made silent," but are probably wrong in doing so. If we take the word in somewhat of the same sense as in Isaiah, the words may point to the place being filled with the mouldering carcases of the silent dead. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - There shall be <span class="cmt_word">no more praise of Moab;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Moab's glory</span> (or, <span class="accented">glorying</span>) <span class="accented">is no more</span> (comp. ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">In Heshbon they have devised evil</span>, etc. There is a word play in the Hebrew, which may be reproduced thus: "In Plot-house they plot evil against it" (so J.
