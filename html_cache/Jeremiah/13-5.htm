The act of hiding the linen belt at Perath is symbolic, representing the impending judgment and exile of Judah. "Perath" is often understood to refer to the Euphrates River, a significant geographical location in biblical history. The Euphrates was a boundary of the land promised to Abraham and a symbol of the great empires that would rise and fall, such as Babylon, which would later conquer Judah. This act of hiding the belt at such a distant location underscores the seriousness of the message and the extent of Judah's coming exile.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded me</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine authority behind Jeremiah's actions. The LORD's command reflects His sovereignty and the certainty of His prophetic word. Jeremiah's compliance is a model of prophetic obedience, illustrating the relationship between God and His prophets. This obedience is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in figures like Moses and Elijah, who also acted according to God's specific instructions. The command also foreshadows the fulfillment of God's plans, as seen in the eventual Babylonian captivity, aligning with the broader narrative of Israel's history and God's redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

His willingness to act illustrates that obedience precedes understanding.<p>&#8226; Similar patterns appear in Abraham leaving Ur &#8220;so Abram went, as the LORD had told him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah &#8220;went and did according to the word of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-5.htm">1 Kings 17:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus commended such responsiveness: &#8220;Blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>).<p>In Jeremiah&#8217;s day, when priests and kings were resisting God&#8217;s voice (<a href="/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8&#8211;11</a>), this single prophet&#8217;s obedience stands in stark contrast, highlighting that one faithful person can still embody covenant loyalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and hid it</b><p>The hiding of the linen waistband (<a href="/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1</a>) is an acted-out parable. Linen was the fabric of priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>), symbolizing purity and close fellowship with God. By burying it, Jeremiah portrays Judah&#8217;s deliberate decision to conceal rather than display their distinct calling.<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; What is hidden loses its usefulness (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; What is buried unused begins to decay, echoing Jesus&#8217; warning about the servant who hid his talent in the ground (<a href="/matthew/25-18.htm">Matthew 25:18, 26</a>).<p>&#8226; The image foretells that Judah&#8217;s pride will spoil their witness (<a href="/jeremiah/13-9.htm">Jeremiah 13:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at Perath</b><p>&#8220;Perath&#8221; is often identified with the Euphrates River, the very corridor along which Judah would soon be exiled to Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>). Placing the waistband there links the symbolic act to coming judgment from the north.<p>&#8226; The Euphrates marked the outer boundary of God&#8217;s promise to Abram (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>); now it becomes the boundary of discipline.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s history with foreign powers repeatedly converged at this river (<a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>), underscoring that turning to those powers instead of to the LORD brings ruin (<a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>Whether the spot was a long journey or a closer site with the same name, the point remains: the people&#8217;s corruption would be exposed far from home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the LORD had commanded me</b><p>Jeremiah anchors every action in God&#8217;s directive. Obedience validates the message; the prophet does nothing by whim.<p>&#8226; Moses did &#8220;just as the LORD had commanded him&#8221; in constructing the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul lost the throne for selective obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus modeled perfect submission: &#8220;I always do what pleases Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>).<p>By citing the divine command, Jeremiah invites his audience to recognize the ultimate authority behind his dramatic sermon&#8212;God Himself, whose word is unfailingly accurate and whose judgments always stand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase of <a href="/jeremiah/13-5.htm">Jeremiah 13:5</a> underscores the lesson: wholehearted obedience reveals faith, while hidden, neglected devotion leads to ruin. Jeremiah&#8217;s simple journey, the burial of a once-pure garment, the ominous setting at Perath, and the explicit mention of God&#8217;s command weave together a vivid call to remain visibly faithful. When God speaks, His people are to respond promptly, keep their calling in view, and trust that His directions, however puzzling, are always for their good and His glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/13-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1461;&#1429;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
