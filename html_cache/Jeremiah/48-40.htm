In the prophetic books, such declarations often precede a message of judgment or salvation. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, highlighting that the message is not from human origin but from the Creator Himself.<p><b>Behold, an eagle swoops down:</b><br>The imagery of an eagle is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing swiftness and power. In <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, an eagle represents a nation coming swiftly against Israel as a form of judgment. Here, the eagle likely symbolizes the Babylonian empire, known for its military might and rapid conquests. The eagle's swooping action suggests an imminent and unavoidable attack, reflecting the suddenness of divine judgment.<p><b>and spreads his wings against Moab:</b><br>Moab was a nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel. The spreading of wings indicates a comprehensive and overwhelming assault, leaving no escape for Moab. Historically, Moab had a tumultuous relationship with Israel, sometimes allying with them and other times opposing them. This judgment against Moab fulfills earlier prophecies and reflects God's sovereignty over all nations. The imagery also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's justice against nations that oppose His will, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and the surrounding nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

The statement&#8217;s authority rests on the LORD&#8217;s own voice, the imagery stresses speed and totality, and the named target highlights God&#8217;s precise justice.
