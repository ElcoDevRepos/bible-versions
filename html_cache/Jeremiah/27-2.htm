Throughout the Old Testament, prophets often begin their messages with a declaration of divine origin, underscoring that their words are not their own but from God. This establishes the seriousness and authenticity of the message. In the context of Jeremiah, this is crucial as he often faced opposition and disbelief.<p><b>Make for yourself a yoke out of leather straps:</b><br>The yoke is a powerful symbol in biblical literature, representing submission and servitude. In ancient agrarian societies, a yoke was used to harness animals for plowing, symbolizing control and direction. Here, it signifies the impending subjugation of Judah and the surrounding nations under Babylonian rule. The use of leather straps suggests durability and strength, indicating the inescapable nature of this subjugation. This act is a prophetic sign, a common method used by prophets to convey God's message visually and tangibly.<p><b>and put it on your neck:</b><br>By placing the yoke on his own neck, Jeremiah embodies the message, demonstrating the reality of the prophecy. This act of wearing the yoke is a vivid illustration of the burden and oppression that will come upon the people. It serves as a physical manifestation of the spiritual and political reality that Judah will face. This symbolic action is reminiscent of other prophetic acts in the Bible, such as Isaiah walking barefoot and naked (<a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-4</a>) or Ezekiel lying on his side (<a href="/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>), which were meant to capture attention and convey a deeper message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Each phrase highlights divine authority, prophetic obedience, the certainty and firmness of the judgment, and the call for God&#8217;s people to yield to His sovereign plan rather than resist and suffer harsher consequences.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Make thee bonds and yokes.</span>--This method of vivid symbolic prediction had a precedent in the conduct of Isaiah when he walked "naked and barefoot" (<a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>). We have to realise the infinitely more vivid impression which the appearance of the prophet in this strange guise, as though he were at once a captive slave and a beast of burden, would make on the minds of men, as compared with simply warning them of a coming subjugation. The principle on which the prophet acted was that of Horace (<span class= "ital">Ep. ad Pis. </span>180):--<p>"<span class= "ital">Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures,<p>Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quae<p>Ipse sibi tradit spectator."</span><p>"Things that we hear less stir the inmost soul,<p>Than what the eye sees dramatised in act."<p>So Agabus bound himself with Paul's girdle (<a href="/acts/21-11.htm" title="And when he was come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus said the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownes this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.">Acts 21:11</a>). So Ezekiel dug through the wall of his house and carried out his stuff (<a href="/context/ezekiel/12-5.htm" title="Dig you through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.">Ezekiel 12:5-7</a>). We find from <a href="/jeremiah/28-10.htm" title="Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.">Jeremiah 28:10</a> that the prophet obeyed the command quite literally. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make thee bends and yokes</span>; rather, bands <span class="accented">and poles</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bands which secured the two pieces of wood placed respectively above and beneath the neck of the ox, so forming a yoke.
