<a href="/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The act reverses the dignity of burial, symbolizing total rejection by God (<a href="/jeremiah/14-16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/8-1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1</a> announces a specific, divinely appointed judgment in which every segment of Judah&#8217;s society&#8212;royal, civil, religious, prophetic, and common&#8212;will experience the utmost disgrace: their bones exhumed and scattered. By stripping away burial honor, God exposes the emptiness of human pride and false religion, underscoring that persistent rebellion invites shame and devastation. Yet behind this stark warning stands God&#8217;s unchanging righteousness, calling His people to repentance before &#8220;that time&#8221; arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VIII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">At that time.</span>--There is, it is obvious, no break in the discourse, and the time is therefore that of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans, and of the burial of the slain. Not even the dead should sleep in peace. With an awful re-iteration of the word, so as to give the emphasis as of the toll of a funeral bell, the prophet heaps clause upon clause, "the <span class= "ital">bones </span>of the kings," "the <span class= "ital">bones </span>of the princes," and so on. The motives of this desecration of the sepulchres might be either the wanton ferocity of barbarian conquerors, bent, after the manner of savage warfare, on the mutilation of the dead, or the greed of gain and the expectation of finding concealed treasures. So Hyrcanus, to the great scandal of the Jews, broke open the sepulchre of David (Joseph., <span class= "ital">Ant. </span>vii. 15).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - Punishment will even overtake the sinners who have long since been deceased. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall bring out the bones</span>. Not only shall many of the dead bodies remain unburied, but the sepulchers of those who have till now "lain in honor, each one in his house" (<a href="/isaiah/14-18.htm">Isaiah 14:18</a>), shall be violated. <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Jerusalem</span> meant are evidently those of the upper class, for the others were buried, with but little regard to the security of the corpses, in the valley of Kedron (<a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>). According to some, the motive of this invasion of the chambers of the dead is avarice (comp. Herod., 1:187, Darius at the tomb of Nitocris); but the context, without excluding this view, rather suggests malice and contempt. Thus "the wrath of man" was to "praise" Jehovah (<a href="/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/8-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
