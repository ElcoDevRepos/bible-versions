It reflects a common biblical theme where God is portrayed as omniscient, aware of human thoughts and actions. This rhetorical question emphasizes the importance of being attentive to the words and attitudes of others, especially when they concern divine matters.<p><b>&#8216;The LORD has rejected the two families He had chosen&#8217;:</b><br>The "two families" likely refer to the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, representing the descendants of Jacob's sons, Joseph and Judah. Historically, these two kingdoms were central to the identity of the Israelites. The statement reflects a period of doubt and despair, possibly during or after the Babylonian exile, when it seemed that God had abandoned His covenant people. This sentiment echoes the lamentations found in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/lamentations/5-20.htm">Lamentations 5:20</a>, where the people question God's continued favor.<p><b>So they despise My people:</b><br>This phrase highlights the contempt and scorn directed towards the Israelites by surrounding nations or even among the Israelites themselves. It reflects a broader theme of the Israelites facing derision and persecution, as seen throughout their history. This contempt can be linked to the consequences of their disobedience and the resulting exile, as prophesied in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>.<p><b>and no longer regard them as a nation:</b><br>The loss of national identity is a significant theme in the context of the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were removed from their land and scattered. This phrase underscores the perceived end of Israel as a distinct people, fulfilling prophecies of dispersion due to disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). However, it also sets the stage for prophetic promises of restoration and renewal, as seen in later verses of <a href="/jeremiah/33.htm">Jeremiah 33</a>, where God assures the restoration of Israel and Judah. This restoration is often seen as a type of the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who restores the spiritual Israel, the Church, as a holy nation (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is addressing the concerns and complaints of the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_families.htm">The Two Families</a></b><br>Refers to the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah, representing the chosen people of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The Israelites, who are expressing doubt and despair over their status as God's chosen nation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message, providing hope and reassurance to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nation.htm">The Nation</a></b><br>The collective identity of Israel and Judah, which is being questioned and despised by others.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite appearances, God remains faithful to His promises.

To despise Israel is to misread history and doubt God&#8217;s reliability. Even when circumstances scream &#8220;abandoned,&#8221; Scripture affirms the literal, ongoing nationhood and divine favor promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;promises that anchor every believer&#8217;s confidence in a God who never retracts His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24-26) <span class= "bld">Considerest thou not what this people have spoken . . .</span>--The words that follow have been regarded by many commentators as the taunt of the heathen nations--Chaldaeans, Egyptians, Edomites, and others--as they beheld what seemed to them the entire downfall of the kingly and the priestly orders, such as we find put into the lips of the heathen in <a href="/ezekiel/35-10.htm" title="Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:">Ezekiel 35:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm" title="And when they entered to the heathen, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. The words "this people," however, used as they are invariably of that to which the prophet himself belonged (<a href="/jeremiah/4-10.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the soul.">Jeremiah 4:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm" title="Why thus said the LORD God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.">Jeremiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-23.htm" title="But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.">Jeremiah 5:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm" title="Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.">Jeremiah 6:19</a>, and elsewhere), and indeed in the hundred or more passages in which the phrase occurs in the Old Testament, lead to a different conclusion. The prophet's declaration of the steadfastness of God's covenant was made in answer, not to the taunts of the heathen, but to the despair of Israel, such as had found utterance in the words recorded in <a href="/jeremiah/33-10.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,">Jeremiah 33:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/32-43.htm" title="And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof you say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 32:43</a>. If the words "thus they have despised my people" seem to favour the former interpretation, it must be remembered that the subject of the verb is not necessarily the same as that of the previous clause, and that the scorn of other nations would be the natural outcome of the despondency into which Israel had fallen; or they might emphasise the fact that the despondency was itself, as it were, suicidal. Those who despised their own nation were despising the people of Jehovah. In contrast with this despondency, the prophet renews his assurance of the permanence of the kingly and priestly lines, and strengthens it by reference to the three great patriarchs of the race, with whom the truth of Jehovah's promises was identified (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm" title="And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.">Exodus 3:15</a>), and by connecting it with the promise of a return from the captivity. When that return came, it would be the pledge and earnest of the yet greater blessings which were involved in the new and everlasting covenant. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This people;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not Egyptians or Babylonians (as some have supposed), but the people of Judah, regarded as alienated from Jehovah (hence the touch of disparagement), as elsewhere in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14, 23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>, etc.).
