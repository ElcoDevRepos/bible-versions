This month is significant in Jewish tradition, as it includes important festivals such as the Feast of Trumpets (Rosh Hashanah), the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), and the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot). These festivals are times of reflection, repentance, and celebration, which adds a layer of irony to the treacherous events that unfold in this chapter.<p><b>Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama</b><br>Ishmael is identified as the son of Nethaniah and the grandson of Elishama. Elishama may have been a scribe or a notable figure in the royal court, as the name appears in other contexts within the royal administration (<a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a>). Ishmael's lineage suggests he had a legitimate claim to leadership and was possibly motivated by political ambition.<p><b>who was a member of the royal family</b><br>Being of royal descent, Ishmael had a vested interest in the political landscape of Judah. His royal lineage implies a connection to the house of David, which may have fueled his resentment towards Gedaliah, who was appointed governor by the Babylonians rather than being of royal blood.<p><b>and one of the king&#8217;s chief officers</b><br>This designation indicates that Ishmael held a significant position within the Judean hierarchy, possibly under King Zedekiah. His status as a chief officer suggests he had military experience and influence, which he could leverage to gather support for his cause.<p><b>came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah</b><br>Gedaliah was appointed governor over the remnant of Judah by the Babylonians after the fall of Jerusalem. Mizpah served as the administrative center under Gedaliah's governance. The presence of ten men with Ishmael indicates a premeditated plan, as ten is often a number associated with completeness or a quorum in Jewish tradition.<p><b>and they ate a meal together there</b><br>Sharing a meal in ancient Near Eastern culture was a sign of fellowship and trust. This act of hospitality by Gedaliah towards Ishmael and his men underscores the treachery of Ishmael's subsequent actions. The meal setting is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where betrayal follows a shared meal, such as Judas betraying Jesus after the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-20.htm">Matthew 26:20-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael_son_of_nethaniah.htm">Ishmael son of Nethaniah</a></b><br>A man of royal descent, possibly a member of the Davidic line, who was one of the king's officers.

In the very month ordained for repentance and rejoicing, a royal prince leveraged privilege, rank, and shared bread to shatter the order God had mercifully established. Scripture presents the account plainly, calling us to trust God&#8217;s timing, test motives, and guard covenant loyalty, knowing He sees every heart and will vindicate truth in His perfect time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XLI.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">It came to pass in the seventh month.</span>--It lies in the nature of the case that the visit purported to be one of courtesy and recognition. The remaining representatives of the house of David (<a href="/jeremiah/40-8.htm" title="Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.">Jeremiah 40:8</a>) would show that they were ready to welcome the new Satrap. As the seventh month included the Feast of Tabernacles, it is not unlikely that they came as if to share in its festivities. Three months had passed since the capture of the city (<a href="/jeremiah/39-2.htm" title="And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.">Jeremiah 39:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - Assassination of Gedaliah and other Jews. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the seventh month;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two months after the destruction of Jerusalem and the appointment of Gedaliah. It seems strange, however, that the occurrences related in ch. 40. and 41. should have taken so short a time. Gratz calls in question the accuracy of the chronological statement. He quotes <a href="/ezekiel/33-24.htm">Ezekiel 33:24-29</a>, which shows that at least six months (according to his calculation) after the fall of Jerusalem Jewish fugitives still lingered on, and hoped to obtain possession of their fatherland, and points out that time was necessary for Gedaliah to erect a temple at Mizpah (see on ver. 5), for cities to arise out of their ruins, and for cultivation of the soil to be resumed (<a href="/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>). Besides, according to <a href="/jeremiah/52-30.htm">Jeremiah 52:30</a>, a third deportation of Jews is mentioned. How can this be accounted for, if, only two months after the fall of Jerusalem, the remnant of the Jewish population emigrated under Johanan ben Kareah to Egypt? Gratz shows reason for thinking that this last deportation stands in close connection with Gedaliah's death, and that consequently the interval between this latter event and the fall of Jerusalem lasted, not two months, but five years. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Elishama.</span> Perhaps the Elishama men. tioned in <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a> as a secretary of state; or perhaps a son of David of that name (see <a href="/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/3-8.htm">1 Chronicles 3:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>; "son" being taken here in a wider sense). <span class="cmt_word">And the princes of the king;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">one of</span>) <span class="accented">the princes of the king. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Even ten men;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> ten men.
