Egypt was a powerful nation and often a symbol of worldly power and idolatry. Judah, representing the southern kingdom of Israel, was often warned by prophets for its disobedience. Edom, descended from Esau, had a long-standing enmity with Israel. Ammon and Moab, both descendants of Lot, frequently opposed Israel. The inhabitants of the desert who clip the hair of their temples likely refer to nomadic tribes practicing pagan rituals, which were forbidden in Israelite law (<a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>). This list underscores the widespread nature of idolatry and rebellion against God.<p><b>For all these nations are uncircumcised,</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). To be uncircumcised was to be outside this covenant, symbolizing spiritual impurity and separation from God. The nations listed were physically uncircumcised, representing their lack of covenant relationship with God and their spiritual defilement.<p><b>and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.&#8221;</b><br>While Israel practiced physical circumcision, God, through Jeremiah, highlights a deeper issue: the lack of spiritual devotion and obedience. This concept of being "uncircumcised in heart" is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a> and <a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>, emphasizing the need for inner transformation and genuine faith.

Jeremiah later says, &#8220;The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;I am about to punish Amon of Thebes, Pharaoh, Egypt and her gods&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25</a>). Leaning on Egypt&#8217;s chariots instead of the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>) exposes a heart that trusts human strength rather than God&#8217;s covenant promises. The inclusion of Egypt shows that rank, influence, or history cannot shelter a nation from divine scrutiny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Judah</b><p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s name beside Egypt&#8217;s is shocking, because Judah bears the covenant sign of circumcision. Yet Jeremiah has already lamented, &#8220;Judah has not returned to Me with all her heart, but only in pretense&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/3-10.htm">Jeremiah 3:10</a>). Outward rituals mean little when the heart stays stubborn (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8&#8211;9</a>). God measures holiness by obedience and humility, not pedigree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Edom</b><p>&#8226; Edom, descended from Esau, often harbored ancient grudges against Israel. Obadiah foretells, &#8220;Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you&#8221; (<a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 10</a>). Pride in its mountain strongholds (<a href="/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16</a>) will not spare Edom from the same verdict&#8212;uncircumcised and exposed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ammon</b><p>&#8226; Ammon&#8217;s cruelty is notorious: &#8220;For three transgressions of the Ammonites &#8230; they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead&#8221; (<a href="/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>). Such barbarity illustrates how paganism can harden a nation. Their name here warns that violence against God&#8217;s people invites certain judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/25-1.htm">Ezekiel 25:1&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moab</b><p>&#8226; Moab&#8217;s inclusion highlights arrogant self&#8211;reliance. Jeremiah devotes an entire chapter to it: &#8220;Moab has been at ease from his youth &#8230; therefore his taste has remained the same&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a>). Reliance on comfort and tradition, minus repentance, places Moab under the same divine sentence as her neighbors.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the inhabitants of the desert who clip the hair of their temples</b><p>&#8226; These are the desert tribes (<a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; 49:32) whose distinctive hairstyle marked their identity. Their outward symbol, like circumcision for Israel, could not substitute for obedience. God notices every cultural marker, yet He looks past symbols to see whether hearts are yielded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For all these nations are uncircumcised</b><p>&#8226; Physical uncircumcision pictures spiritual alienation (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>). The Lord levels the field: Egypt, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and the desert tribes all stand outside the covenant and therefore outside its protection. &#8220;Remember that at that time you were separate from Christ &#8230; foreigners to the covenants of the promise&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart</b><p>&#8226; Israel did bear the physical sign, but lacked the inner reality. Moses had urged, &#8220;Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and stiffen your necks no more&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>). Paul echoes, &#8220;A man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>). God&#8217;s covenant demands both outer sign and inner surrender; possessing only the former brings greater, not lesser, accountability (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a> places Israel shoulder-to-shoulder with its pagan neighbors to show that outward marks&#8212;whether military might, cultural identity, or even covenant signs&#8212;cannot shield anyone from God&#8217;s judgment. Physical circumcision without heart obedience leaves Israel as spiritually naked as Egypt, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and the desert tribes. God seeks hearts humbled, trusts that rest in Him alone, and lives shaped by His word. Anything less, no matter how religious or respectable, is uncircumcision in His sight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Egypt, and Judah . . .</span>--The nations enumerated were all alike, the Egyptians certainly (Herod. ii. 36, 37), and the others, as belonging to the same race as Judah, probably, in the fact of circumcision, and are apparently brought together not without some touch of scornful humour. How could Israel pride itself in that which it had in common with some of the nations that it most abhorred. The later Idumaeans seem to have abandoned the practice till it was forced upon them by John Hyrcanus (Joseph., <span class= "ital">Ant. xi.</span> 9, 15:7). Jerome (<span class= "ital">in loc.</span>) affirms that the nations named practised circumcision in his time, and its adoption by Islam indicates its prevalence among the Arabs in that of Mahomet.<p><span class= "bld">All that are in the utmost corners.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">all that have the corners </span>(<span class= "ital">of their temples</span>)<span class= "ital"> shorn. </span>The epithet, like our "cross-eared" or "round-head," was obviously one of scorn, and was applied (as again in <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm" title="Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-32.htm" title="And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:32</a>) to a wild Arabian tribe who, as described by Herodotus (3:8), shaved their temples and let their hair grow long behind. The "wilderness" is the Arabian desert to the east of Palestine, inhabited by the Ishmaelites and other kindred races. As if to complete the contempt which he pours on circumcision, the prophet speaks of the barbarous people, whose customs were specially forbidden to Israel (<a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27</a>), as in this respect standing on the same level with Israel. If circumcision by itself were enough to secure immunity from judgment, they too, as practising a rite analogous though not identical, might claim it.<p><span class= "bld">All these nations are uncircumcised.</span>--The English Version makes the prophet say exactly the opposite of what he really said. <span class= "ital">All the heathen </span>(not "these nations") are in God's sight as uncircumcised, whether they practise the outward rite or not--and the state of Israel was not a whit better than theirs, for she too was uncircumcised in heart. Once again Jeremiah is the forerunner of St. Paul's <a href="/context/romans/2-25.htm" title="For circumcision truly profits, if you keep the law: but if you be a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.">Romans 2:25-29</a>. It may be noted that the same nations are enumerated afterwards as coming under Nebuchadnezzar's conquests (<a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm" title="Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,">Jeremiah 25:23</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that are in the utmost corners</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all that</span> <span class="accented">are corner-clipped</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that have the hair cut off about the ears and temples. Herodotus tells us, speaking of the Arabs, "Their practice is to cut the hair in a ring, away from the temples" (3:8); and among the representatives of various nations, colored figures of whom are given in the tomb of Rameses III., we find some with a square place shaved just above the temples. The hair below this shaven place was allowed to grow long, and then plaited into a leek. It is to such customs that Jeremiah alludes here and in <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>. A prohibition is directed against them in the Levitical Law (<a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For all these nations are uncircumcised</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the nations</span>, etc. Another obscure expression. Does it mean (taken together with the following clause), "The Gentile peoples are uncircumcised in the flesh, and the people of Israel is equally so in heart?" But this does not agree with facts (see above, on Ver. 25). It is safer, therefore, to assume that "uncircumcised" is equivalent to "circumcised in uncircumcision" (Ver. 25). The next clause will then simply give the most conspicuous instance of this unspiritual obedience to a mere form. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Egypt,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Judah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Edom,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1438;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_123.htm">Strong's 123: </a> </span><span class="str2">The name of a condiment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ammon,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5983.htm">Strong's 5983: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ammon -- a people living East of the Jordan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moab,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4124.htm">Strong's 4124: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moab -- a son of Lot,also his descendants and the territory where they settled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the inhabitants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
