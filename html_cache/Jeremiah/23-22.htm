The concept of God's council is seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a> and <a href="/psalms/82.htm">Psalm 82:1</a>, where God is depicted as presiding over a heavenly assembly. The prophets are expected to receive their messages directly from God, indicating a close relationship and alignment with His will. The failure to stand in God's council implies a lack of true prophetic insight and authority, contrasting with true prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who were known for their direct communication with God.<p><b>they would have proclaimed My words to My people</b><br>True prophets are characterized by their faithfulness in delivering God's messages. This phrase underscores the responsibility of prophets to speak God's words, not their own. In <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-20</a>, God promises to raise up a prophet who will speak His words, and the people are held accountable to listen. The failure to proclaim God's words results in spiritual and moral decay among the people, as seen in the context of Jeremiah's ministry, where false prophets led the people astray with messages of peace and security when judgment was imminent.<p><b>and turned them back from their evil ways and deeds.</b><br>The role of a prophet is not only to deliver God's words but also to call people to repentance. This phrase highlights the transformative power of God's word when faithfully proclaimed. The call to turn from evil is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30-32</a>, where God pleads with Israel to repent and live. The failure of the false prophets to lead the people to repentance contrasts with the ministry of Jesus Christ, who called people to repentance and faith, as seen in <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>.

Are the people better or worse for the prophet's work? What are the fruits of his teaching? (Comp. <a href="/matthew/7-20.htm" title="Why by their fruits you shall know them.">Matthew 7:20</a>.) The question meets us, Is this always a test? Was Jeremiah's own work successful in this sense? Must not the true teacher speak "whether they [men] will hear, or whether they will forbear?" (<a href="/ezekiel/2-5.htm" title="And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.">Ezekiel 2:5</a>.) The answer is found (1) in the fact that true teaching seldom fails altogether of its work; (2) that where it seems to fail it satisfies the other test, and at least stirs and rouses men from lethargy, even if it stirs them to antagonism. It is never satisfied with speaking smooth things and acquiescing in the evil that surrounds it.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/23-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1469;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
