In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/26.htm">Jeremiah 26</a>, "these things" refer to the prophetic warnings Jeremiah delivered about the impending destruction of Jerusalem if the people did not repent. This reflects the role of prophets in ancient Israel as messengers of God, often bringing unwelcome news to those in power. The officials' response indicates the seriousness with which they took Jeremiah's message, as they were responsible for maintaining order and addressing potential threats to the kingdom.<p><b>they went up from the king&#8217;s palace</b><br>The king's palace was the center of political power in Judah. The phrase "went up" suggests a movement from a place of political authority to a place of religious significance, indicating a shift in focus from secular governance to spiritual matters. This movement underscores the interconnectedness of religion and politics in ancient Israel, where decisions often required divine consultation or intervention.<p><b>to the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The temple was not only a religious center but also a place where legal matters and disputes could be addressed. This setting highlights the gravity of the situation, as the officials sought to address Jeremiah's prophecy in the presence of God, acknowledging the divine authority behind his words.<p><b>and sat there at the entrance of the New Gate</b><br>The New Gate was one of the gates of the temple complex, possibly a recently constructed or renovated entrance. Sitting at the entrance signifies a formal assembly or court session, where matters of great importance were deliberated. This location suggests that the officials were preparing to conduct a serious inquiry or trial regarding Jeremiah's prophecy. The New Gate's mention may also symbolize a new phase or decision point for the nation, as they faced the choice of heeding God's warning or continuing in their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/officials_of_judah.htm">Officials of Judah</a></b><br>These were the leaders and authorities in the kingdom of Judah, responsible for governance and maintaining order.

Their immediate response shows that the prophetic word penetrated beyond the crowd (compare <a href="/jeremiah/36-11.htm">Jeremiah 36:11-12</a>, where other officials react to Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently portrays rulers as responsible to heed God&#8217;s warnings (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-19.htm">2 Chronicles 24:19-21</a>). Here, they do not shrug off Jeremiah&#8217;s message; they move to act on it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They went up from the king&#8217;s palace</b><p>&#8226; Leaving the palace meant stepping out of political comfort into a spiritual arena. Like Josiah leaving his throne to read the rediscovered law (<a href="/2_kings/22-11.htm">2 Kings 22:11</a>), the move signals urgency.<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;went up&#8221; reminds readers that Jerusalem&#8217;s topography places the Temple higher than the palace; the ascent pictures submission to a higher authority&#8212;God Himself (<a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Even earthly power must rise to meet divine authority; rulers recognize they are not the ultimate court.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The Temple was Israel&#8217;s supreme court for weighty cases (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-13</a>). By convening there, the officials acknowledge that Jeremiah&#8217;s preaching is not merely civil disturbance but a covenant issue needing God&#8217;s verdict.<p>&#8226; Earlier prophets often brought their disputes before the Temple (<a href="/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-1.htm">Jeremiah 7:1-4</a>). The pattern reinforces that true justice flows from God&#8217;s dwelling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And sat there at the entrance of the New Gate</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Sat&#8221; indicates formal judicial session; elders and judges sat to render verdicts (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;New Gate&#8221; was on the north side of the inner court (<a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>). Its name suggests recent renovation under Josiah, the reform-minded king. A place associated with renewal becomes the stage for deciding whether Judah will heed renewal or face judgment.<p>&#8226; Public visibility matters: proceedings at a gate were in full view (<a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2-6</a>; <a href="/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10-15</a>). This open court underscores accountability&#8212;leaders cannot cloak their response to God&#8217;s word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a> captures a pivotal moment: national leaders immediately take the prophet&#8217;s warning seriously, ascend from royal halls to God&#8217;s house, and convene a public court at the Temple gate. Their actions acknowledge that divine revelation supersedes political power, justice must be sought before the Lord, and the community will witness the outcome. The verse teaches that when God&#8217;s word confronts a nation, true authority bows, gathers at His dwelling, and deliberates under His watchful eye.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">When the princes of Judah heard these things . . .</span>--The princes appear not to have been present when the words were spoken.
