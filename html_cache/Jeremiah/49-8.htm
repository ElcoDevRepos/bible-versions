It reflects the impending danger and the need for swift escape. In the context of biblical prophecy, such calls often indicate divine judgment that is unavoidable and imminent. The urgency here is reminiscent of other biblical warnings, such as the call to flee from Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>).<p><b>Lie low, O dwellers of Dedan,</b><br>Dedan was a region inhabited by a nomadic tribe known for trading. It is often associated with the Arabian Peninsula. The instruction to "lie low" suggests seeking refuge or hiding, indicating that the threat is severe. Historically, Dedan was a trading partner with Edom, and this warning implies that Dedan's proximity to Edom's judgment puts them at risk. The call to lie low is similar to the advice given in times of war or disaster, emphasizing the need for caution and discretion.<p><b>for I will bring disaster on Esau</b><br>Esau represents the nation of Edom, descended from Esau, Jacob's brother. The disaster mentioned is a divine judgment against Edom for its pride and hostility towards Israel. This prophecy aligns with other biblical passages that predict Edom's downfall, such as <a href="/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 1:1-4</a>. The judgment on Esau is part of a broader theme of God's justice against nations that oppose His people.<p><b>at the time I punish him.</b><br>This phrase indicates a specific, divinely appointed time for judgment. It underscores the certainty and inevitability of God's justice. The timing of divine punishment is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God acts according to His perfect plan and timing. This reflects the biblical principle that God is sovereign over history and nations, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>, which speaks of a time for every matter under heaven, including judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dedan.htm">Dedan</a></b><br>An ancient trading community, likely located in the Arabian Peninsula.

When the Lord&#8217;s wrath is about to fall, He graciously warns first (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-16.htm">Matthew 24:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>). Edom&#8217;s neighbors must remove themselves or be swept away with her. Like the trumpet blasts in <a href="/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5&#8211;6</a>, the summons here underscores that safety lies only in obeying God&#8217;s word without delay.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lie low, O dwellers of Dedan,</b><p>Dedan was a trading people linked to Edom, living in the Arabian deserts (<a href="/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>).
