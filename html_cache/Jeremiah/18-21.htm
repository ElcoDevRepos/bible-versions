In the context of Jeremiah, the people of Judah had persistently turned away from God, despite numerous warnings. Famine is often used in the Bible as a form of divine judgment (<a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/5-16.htm">Ezekiel 5:16</a>). It signifies not only physical hunger but also spiritual desolation. The handing over of children to famine underscores the depth of the nation's sin, affecting even the most vulnerable.<p><b>pour out the power of the sword upon them.</b><br>The sword symbolizes war and destruction, a common theme in prophetic literature as a tool of divine retribution (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). The "power of the sword" indicates a complete and overwhelming defeat, suggesting that the people will face not just military defeat but also the loss of protection and peace. This phrase highlights the seriousness of turning away from God's covenant, as the sword often represents God's judgment against nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41-42</a>).<p><b>Let their wives become childless and widowed;</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the social and familial devastation that results from judgment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, women relied heavily on their husbands and children for social status and economic security. Becoming childless and widowed would leave them vulnerable and destitute. This reflects the broader theme of societal collapse due to sin, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>, where Jerusalem is described as a widow.<p><b>let their husbands be slain by disease,</b><br>Disease as a form of judgment is seen throughout the Bible, often accompanying war and famine (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-21.htm">Deuteronomy 28:21-22</a>). It serves as a reminder of the frailty of human life and the consequences of living outside of God's will. The slaying of husbands by disease further compounds the suffering of the community, leaving families without providers and protectors.<p><b>their young men struck down by the sword in battle.</b><br>Young men represent the strength and future of a nation. Their being struck down in battle signifies not only immediate loss but also a bleak future for the community. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative where the loss of young warriors is a sign of divine displeasure and a precursor to national decline (<a href="/2_samuel/1-25.htm">2 Samuel 1:25</a>, <a href="/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>). It underscores the theme of judgment and the dire consequences of forsaking God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is delivering God's message.

It is not ours to judge another man's servant.
