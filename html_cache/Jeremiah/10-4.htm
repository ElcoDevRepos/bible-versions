Silver and gold were often used to cover wooden idols, making them appear more valuable and divine. This practice is condemned in the Bible as it reflects the futility of idol worship, contrasting the living God with lifeless idols. The use of precious metals is reminiscent of the golden calf in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, where the Israelites fell into idolatry. The adornment of idols is a superficial attempt to give them worth, highlighting the emptiness of worshipping created objects rather than the Creator.<p><b>and fasten it with hammer and nails</b><br>The act of fastening idols with hammer and nails underscores their lifelessness and inability to stand on their own. This imagery emphasizes the dependency of idols on human craftsmanship and support, contrasting with the self-sustaining nature of the true God. In <a href="/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7 and 44</a>:12-13, similar descriptions are given, mocking the process of idol creation. The need to secure idols with tools highlights their impotence and the absurdity of attributing divine power to them.<p><b>so that it will not totter</b><br>This phrase illustrates the instability and vulnerability of idols. Unlike the living God, who is unchanging and eternal, idols require human intervention to remain upright. The word "totter" suggests a lack of foundation and strength, symbolizing the spiritual instability of those who rely on idols. In <a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3-4</a>, the idol Dagon falls before the Ark of the Covenant, demonstrating the superiority of God over false gods. This serves as a reminder of the futility of idol worship and the steadfastness of faith in the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

A craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold.&#8221; The outward sparkle masks the inner emptiness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4</a> reinforces the point: &#8220;Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands.&#8221; No matter how dazzling, man-made gods are still man-made.<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: while idols rely on human artistry, the true God created the very silver and gold people misuse (<a href="/haggai/2-8.htm">Haggai 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fasten it with hammer and nails</b><p>&#8226; The craftsmen pound nails into the idol or its platform to keep it upright&#8212;an ironic picture of &#8220;gods&#8221; needing human help.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a> notes the same ritual: &#8220;The craftsman strengthens it with nails so it will not fall over.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18-19</a> exposes the folly: &#8220;What profit is an idol...
