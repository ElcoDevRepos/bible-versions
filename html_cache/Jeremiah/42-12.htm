In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/42.htm">Jeremiah 42</a>, the people sought guidance from God through the prophet Jeremiah after the Babylonian conquest. Compassion here signifies God's willingness to forgive and restore despite the people's previous disobedience. This echoes God's character as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where He is "compassionate and gracious." It also aligns with the theme of divine mercy found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>.<p><b>and he will have compassion on you</b><br>The "he" refers to the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, who would be moved by God to show mercy to the people. This demonstrates God's sovereignty over nations and rulers, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord. Historically, this reflects the practice of ancient Near Eastern kings who often allowed displaced peoples to return to their homelands, as seen in the Cyrus Cylinder, which records a similar decree by Cyrus the Great.<p><b>and restore you to your own land.</b><br>The promise of restoration to their land is significant, as the land was central to the identity and covenant relationship between God and Israel. This restoration is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing not just physical return but spiritual renewal. It prefigures the ultimate restoration through Christ, who restores believers to a right relationship with God. The return to the land also fulfills earlier prophecies, such as those in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a>, where God promises to bring His people back from captivity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_judah.htm">The Remnant of Judah</a></b><br>The group of Israelites left in Judah after the Babylonian exile, seeking guidance from God through Jeremiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, leading to a significant time of trial and reflection for the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassion.htm">God's Compassion</a></b><br>The divine promise of mercy and restoration, central to the message of hope in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/return_to_the_land.htm">Return to the Land</a></b><br>The promise of restoration to their homeland, symbolizing God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_compassion.htm">Understanding Divine Compassion</a></b><br>God's compassion is not just an emotional response but a commitment to act mercifully towards His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The remnant's request for guidance from God through Jeremiah underscores the importance of seeking and obeying God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_hope.htm">Restoration and Hope</a></b><br>God's promise to restore the Israelites to their land serves as a reminder of His faithfulness and the hope we have in His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>The assurance of restoration requires trust in God's perfect timing, even when circumstances seem dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_god's_promises.htm">Living in God's Promises</a></b><br>Believers today can find encouragement in God's promises of compassion and restoration, applying them to personal trials and spiritual journeys.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_42_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 42:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_mercy_today_2.htm">How can we seek God's mercy as shown in Jeremiah 42:12 today?

The latter is clearly more in harmony with the prophet's aim and temper, and it was probably in his purpose to intercede with their conquerors to this effect. The thought of a far-off exile as impending over them in the nearer future would hardly have induced them to remain where they were.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will show mercies unto you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I will procure you mercy.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And cause you to return to.</span> As if the journey to Bethlehem were a virtual Exodus, But it is far more natural to read the consonants of the text in a slightly different manner, rendering, "and cause you to dwell in."
