He was placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon after the exile of Jehoiachin. Zedekiah was a son of Josiah, a king known for his religious reforms and dedication to the LORD. The beginning of Zedekiah's reign marks a tumultuous period in Judah's history, characterized by political instability and looming Babylonian threat. This context is crucial as it sets the stage for Jeremiah's prophetic ministry, which often warned of impending judgment due to the nation's disobedience.<p><b>this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD</b><br>Jeremiah, a prophet called by God, served during the final years of Judah before the Babylonian exile. The phrase "this word came" indicates divine revelation, emphasizing that Jeremiah's messages were not his own but were directly from the LORD. This underscores the authority and authenticity of his prophecies. Throughout the book, Jeremiah is portrayed as a reluctant yet faithful messenger, often facing persecution for delivering God's warnings. The phrase also highlights the continuity of God's communication with His people, even in times of rebellion and impending judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

We have to think, accordingly, of the state of things which followed on the death of Jehoiakim, and the deposition and exile of Jehoiachin. The tone of the prophecy seems to indicate a time about the middle of Zedekiah's reign. His position was that of a tributary sovereign, subject to Nebuchadnezzar. He and the neighbouring kings, who were in a like position, had not quite renounced the hope of throwing off the yoke, and asserting their independence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning of the reign</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Jehoiakim</span>.
