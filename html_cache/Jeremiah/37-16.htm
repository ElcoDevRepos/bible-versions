The "cell in the dungeon" indicates a harsh and confined space, likely beneath the palace, as dungeons were often subterranean. This setting underscores the physical and emotional suffering endured by prophets who spoke against the prevailing powers. Historically, dungeons were used to silence dissenters, and Jeremiah's experience parallels other biblical figures like Joseph, who was also unjustly imprisoned (<a href="/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20</a>). This phrase highlights the cost of prophetic ministry and the reality of persecution for truth-tellers.<p><b>and remained there a long time</b><br>The duration of Jeremiah's imprisonment signifies prolonged suffering and patience. This period of confinement can be seen as a test of faith and endurance, similar to the trials faced by other biblical figures such as Daniel in the lion's den (Daniel 6) or Paul and Silas in prison (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-26</a>). The phrase suggests a time of reflection and reliance on God, as Jeremiah continued to trust in God's plan despite his circumstances. It also foreshadows the endurance required of believers who face trials, encouraging steadfastness in faith. The "long time" emphasizes the prophet's perseverance and the eventual vindication of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

(cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/acts/21-13.htm">Acts 21:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>- This step of obedience fulfils the prophetic calling God set before him decades earlier&#8212;speaking the truth regardless of personal cost (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; 32:2; <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>- The verse&#8217;s opening &#8220;So&#8221; links his confinement to his faithful proclamation; persecution flows directly from obedience, not disobedience (cf. <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into a cell</b><p>- The word paints a picture of cramped isolation, highlighting the prophet&#8217;s total lack of earthly support (cf. <a href="/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36&#8211;38</a>).<p>- God often refines His servants in small, hidden places before using them publicly (cf. <a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>- Isolation does not signal abandonment; rather, it becomes a meeting place with God, as seen in Paul&#8217;s imprisonments (cf. <a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the dungeon</b><p>- A dungeon was the lowest, darkest, and most unsanitary part of the prison (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-6.htm">Psalm 88:6</a>).<p>- The setting underscores how far national leadership had fallen: instead of heeding God&#8217;s messenger, they buried him beneath the palace (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>- Yet God&#8217;s light shines brightest in literal darkness; in such pits He births Psalms (cf. <a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>) and preserves testimony (cf. <a href="/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52&#8211;57</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and remained there</b><p>- The phrase signals endurance; Jeremiah stays under restraint until God, not man, decides otherwise (cf. <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-19.htm">1 Peter 2:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>- Remaining does not mean inactivity; during confinement he continues to receive and relay God&#8217;s word (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>; 38:14).<p>- Perseverance in trial authenticates the prophet&#8217;s message before a watching world (cf. <a href="/james/5-10.htm">James 5:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a long time</b><p>- God&#8217;s timetable often stretches beyond human comfort (cf. <a href="/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a>).<p>- &#8220;Long&#8221; reminds readers that trials can be prolonged yet purposeful, developing character and hope (cf. <a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>).<p>- Ultimately, Jeremiah&#8217;s lengthy suffering prefigures Christ&#8217;s endurance, pointing us to the true Prophet who also faced unjust confinement before redemption dawned (cf. <a href="/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57&#8211;68</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/37-16.htm">Jeremiah 37:16</a> shows a faithful servant stepping into forced confinement, occupying a cramped dungeon cell, and waiting there for an extended season. Each clause magnifies God&#8217;s sovereignty and the prophet&#8217;s steadfast obedience: he goes where God allows, remains where God places him, and waits as long as God ordains. Far from signaling defeat, the dungeon becomes a stage for divine faithfulness, assuring believers that prolonged darkness never thwarts God&#8217;s purposes but instead refines His messengers and amplifies His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into the dungeon, and into the cabins.</span> The former word undoubtedly implies an underground excavation.
