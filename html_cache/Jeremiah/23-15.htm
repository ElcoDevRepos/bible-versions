The context here is a rebuke directed at the false prophets in Jerusalem, who were misleading the people. This reflects a common theme in the Old Testament where God addresses the failures of spiritual leaders (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13:1-9</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I will feed them wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink,</b><br>Wormwood is a bitter plant often associated with judgment and calamity (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-11.htm">Revelation 8:11</a>). The imagery of consuming wormwood and poisoned water symbolizes the severe consequences and divine retribution that these false prophets will face.

The spread of ungodliness is reminiscent of leaven in dough, a metaphor used by Jesus to describe the pervasive nature of false teachings (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6, 11</a>-12).
