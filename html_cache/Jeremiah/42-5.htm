Jeremiah was a major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah. The context here is after the fall of Jerusalem, when the remnant of Judah is seeking guidance. Jeremiah, as a prophet, served as a mediator between God and the people, often delivering messages that were difficult to hear.<p><b>&#8220;May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us</b><br>Invoking the LORD as a witness underscores the seriousness of their commitment. In ancient Israel, oaths and covenants were often made before God, who was seen as the ultimate judge and witness. This reflects the cultural and religious practice of making solemn promises with divine accountability. The terms "true and faithful" emphasize God's nature as reliable and just, aligning with passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, which describes God as a God of truth.<p><b>if we do not act upon every word</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands. In the biblical narrative, obedience is a central theme, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are contingent upon Israel's adherence to God's law. The commitment to act upon "every word" signifies total submission to divine instruction, a recurring expectation in the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>that the LORD your God sends you to tell us.</b><br>Here, the people acknowledge Jeremiah's role as God's messenger. The phrase "the LORD your God" indicates a recognition of the personal relationship between Jeremiah and God, as well as the authority of the message. This reflects the prophetic tradition where prophets like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>) were sent by God to deliver His words. The people's request for guidance through Jeremiah shows their dependence on divine direction during a time of crisis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Israelites.
