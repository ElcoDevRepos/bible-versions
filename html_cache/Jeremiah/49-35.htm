This title is frequently used in the Old Testament to convey God's supreme power and sovereignty (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>).<p><b>Behold, I will shatter Elam&#8217;s bow:</b><br>Elam was an ancient kingdom located in what is now southwestern Iran. The bow symbolizes military strength and prowess, as Elam was known for its skilled archers. The shattering of the bow indicates a decisive divine intervention that would render Elam's military capabilities ineffective. This prophecy aligns with other biblical instances where God promises to break the power of nations (e.g., <a href="/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>, <a href="/hosea/1-5.htm">Hosea 1:5</a>).<p><b>The mainstay of their might:</b><br>The phrase "mainstay of their might" refers to the core strength or primary reliance of Elam, which in this context is their military power, particularly their archery. By targeting the mainstay, God is declaring that He will dismantle the very foundation of Elam's power. This reflects a common biblical theme where God humbles the proud and powerful (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>, <a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.
