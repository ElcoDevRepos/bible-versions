The use of "behold" draws attention to the seriousness of the situation. Jeremiah, as a prophet, often encountered resistance and disbelief from the people of Judah. This reflects a broader pattern seen throughout the prophetic books, where God's messengers are frequently met with doubt and hostility (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>, <a href="/amos/7-12.htm">Amos 7:12-13</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Where is the word of the LORD?</b><br>The people are questioning the validity and presence of God's word, implying impatience or disbelief in the prophetic messages Jeremiah delivered. This skepticism can be seen as a challenge to Jeremiah's authority and the authenticity of his prophecies. Historically, this reflects a time when Judah was facing impending judgment, and the people were unwilling to accept the warnings of destruction. This mirrors the attitude of those in Noah's time who ignored warnings of the flood (<a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-39</a>).<p><b>Let it come now!&#8221;</b><br>This demand for immediate fulfillment of prophecy reveals a misunderstanding of God's timing and purposes. The people are essentially mocking the prophet, suggesting that if his words were true, they should see immediate evidence. This impatience is contrasted with the biblical theme of waiting on the Lord, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>. The call for immediate proof also foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus faced similar demands for signs and wonders (<a href="/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38-39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

It urges the hearer to stop and notice what follows, just as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> or <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> begin prophetic or revelatory statements with a similar call to focus.<p>- The prophet is confident that what he is about to report is real and certain; nothing is being exaggerated. Like <a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>, God&#8217;s warnings are not vague hints but unmistakable facts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they keep saying to me</b><p>- This is not a one-time remark but an ongoing taunt. The people repeatedly needle Jeremiah, exposing a hard-hearted persistence reminiscent of <a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7&#8211;8</a>, where he laments continual derision.<p>- Their scoffing joins a long line of mockers: <a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a> records how earlier generations &#8220;scoffed at His prophets,&#8221; and <a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3&#8211;4</a> predicts similar attitudes in later days.<p>- Jeremiah is standing firm, yet the ridicule is personal: &#8220;to me.&#8221; Ministry faithfulness often invites such resistance (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Where is the word of the LORD?</b><p>- They question the very reality of God&#8217;s message, as if saying, &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard your sermons; where&#8217;s the proof?&#8221; <a href="/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a> pictures the same spirit: &#8220;Let the counsel of the Holy One draw near&#8230; that we may know it.&#8221;<p>- Their sarcasm dismisses prophetic warnings about judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3-7</a>). Like <a href="/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>, they treat every prophecy as empty, assuming time has disproved it.<p>- Doubting God&#8217;s word is no small matter; <a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a> reminds us that in times of spiritual decline &#8220;the word of the LORD was rare.&#8221; The people don&#8217;t sense the danger of living with that rarity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let it come now!</b><p>- The demand for immediacy&#8212;&#8220;now!&#8221;&#8212;reveals a deeper rebellion. They assume that if judgment has not happened yet, it never will (<a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>).<p>- Their challenge echoes <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>, where people long for &#8220;the Day of the LORD,&#8221; unaware it brings darkness for the unrepentant.<p>- God&#8217;s patience is mistaken for absence. <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9-10</a> clarifies that apparent delay means mercy, not neglect; when the day arrives, it will be sudden, much like <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>: &#8220;while they are saying, &#8216;Peace and safety,&#8217; destruction comes on them suddenly.&#8221;<p>- Instead of repenting, they taunt the prophet, pressing for a quick spectacle&#8212;proof on their terms&#8212;yet Jeremiah knows judgment will come on God&#8217;s terms (<a href="/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/17-15.htm">Jeremiah 17:15</a> captures the dismissive attitude of a people hardened against God: they keep mocking the prophet, doubting the authenticity of divine warnings, and demanding instant fulfillment to satisfy their unbelief. &#8220;Behold&#8221; alerts us to take this seriously; the repeated taunt shows sustained rebellion; the question &#8220;Where is the word of the LORD?&#8221; exposes their contempt for Scripture; and &#8220;Let it come now!&#8221; reveals their presumption. The verse warns every generation not to confuse God&#8217;s patience with impotence&#8212;His word is sure, and when the appointed time arrives, it will come exactly as He has said.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Behold, they say unto me.</span>--The speakers are not named or defined, but they are clearly the mockers who questioned Jeremiah's prophetic character, on the ground (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm" title="When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken, but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously: you shall not be afraid of him.">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>) that his threats had received no fulfilment.
