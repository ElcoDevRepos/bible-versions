Shepherds were responsible for guiding and protecting their flock, symbolizing the leaders' duty to care for the people. The call to "wail" and "cry out" indicates impending judgment and disaster. In the context of Jeremiah, this is a warning of the Babylonian invasion. The shepherds' failure to lead righteously has led to this calamity. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where God condemns the shepherds of Israel for neglecting their duties.<p><b>roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock.</b><br>Rolling in the dust is a sign of mourning and deep distress in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It signifies humility and repentance, actions expected from the leaders in response to the coming judgment. The leaders of the flock, synonymous with the shepherds, are called to acknowledge their failures and the resulting consequences. This act of mourning is similar to Job's response to his suffering (<a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>), highlighting the severity of the situation.<p><b>For the days of your slaughter have come;</b><br>This phrase foretells the imminent destruction and judgment that will befall the leaders and the people they guide. The "days of your slaughter" refers to the Babylonian conquest, a historical event where Jerusalem was besieged, and many were killed or taken into exile. This judgment is a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience to God's laws. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>you will fall and be shattered like fine pottery.</b><br>The imagery of being shattered like fine pottery conveys total destruction and irreparability. Pottery, once broken, cannot be restored to its original form, symbolizing the complete downfall of the leaders and their inability to recover from the judgment. This metaphor is also used in <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>, emphasizing the fragility of human strength and plans when opposed to God's will. The shattering of pottery can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was "broken" for humanity's sins, yet through His resurrection, brought restoration and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>In this context, the shepherds symbolize the leaders of Israel, including kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for guiding the people spiritually and politically.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_of_the_flock.htm">Leaders of the Flock</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the same group as the shepherds, emphasizing their role in leading and protecting the people, who are metaphorically described as the flock.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/days_of_slaughter.htm">Days of Slaughter</a></b><br>This event signifies the impending judgment and destruction that God is bringing upon the leaders and the nation due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shattered_like_fine_pottery.htm">Shattered Like Fine Pottery</a></b><br>This imagery illustrates the complete and irreversible destruction that will come upon the leaders, highlighting the fragility of their power and position when faced with God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_of_leadership.htm">Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are accountable to God for their actions and the spiritual well-being of those they lead.

The "shepherds" are, as usual, the rulers of the people (<a href="/jeremiah/10-21.htm" title="For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.">Jeremiah 10:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-22.htm" title="The wind shall eat up all your pastors, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.">Jeremiah 22:22</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Wallow yourselves in the ashes.</span>--The words in italics have probably been added to bring the passage into conformity with <a href="/jeremiah/6-26.htm" title="O daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come on us.">Jeremiah 6:26</a>, but they are not needed, and the interpretation is unauthorised. Better, therefore, <span class= "ital">roll on the ground. </span>By some interpreters the word is rendered "sprinkle yourselves." The "principal of the flock" are the "strong ones," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the best and fattest of the rams, denoting figuratively the princes and captains of the people.<p><span class= "bld">And of your dispersions.</span>--The Hebrew text seems faulty, and a slight alteration, now generally accepted, gives, <span class= "ital">and I will scatter you.</span><p><span class= "bld">Like a pleasant vessel.</span>--The sudden change of metaphor is somewhat startling, as judged by our rules of rhetoric; but the poets and prophets of Israel wrote without the fear of criticism, and used each image that presented itself, if it was fit for its immediate purpose, without caring much for continuity. The thought of the scattered flock suggested the idea of a dispersion or breaking-up of another kind, even that of the "pleasant vessel" (literally, <span class= "ital">the vessel of desire, i.e., </span>a vase made as for kingly and honourable uses), falling with a crash and shivered into fragments, which Jeremiah had presented to the people in his acted parable and spoken words in <a href="/context/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10-11</a>, and in <a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>. The LXX. translators give <span class= "ital">like the chosen rams, </span>as if anxious to avoid the mixed metaphor, and venturing on a conjectural emendation of the text. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wallow yourselves in the ashes</span>.
