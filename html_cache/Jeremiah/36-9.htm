Jehoiakim reigned from 609 to 598 BC, and the fifth year would be around 604/603 BC. The ninth month corresponds to Kislev in the Hebrew calendar, which is roughly November-December. Jehoiakim was a son of Josiah, a king known for his reforms and dedication to God, contrasting with Jehoiakim's less faithful reign. This period was marked by political instability and the looming threat of Babylonian invasion, as Babylon was asserting dominance over the region.<p><b>a fast before the LORD was proclaimed</b><br>Fasting in ancient Israel was often a sign of repentance, mourning, or seeking divine intervention. It was a communal act of humility and supplication before God. This fast may have been called in response to the dire political situation, as fasting was a way to seek God's favor and guidance. The proclamation of a fast indicates a serious attempt to appeal to God amidst national crisis.<p><b>to all the people of Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the political and spiritual center of Judah, housing the Temple, which was the focal point of Jewish worship. The call to fast would have been significant, as it involved the entire population of the city, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. The people of Jerusalem were directly under the threat of Babylonian conquest, making their participation in the fast crucial.<p><b>and all who had come there from the cities of Judah</b><br>This inclusion highlights the widespread nature of the fast, extending beyond Jerusalem to the surrounding cities. It suggests a united front among the people of Judah in seeking God's mercy. The gathering of people from various cities also underscores the central role of Jerusalem as a religious and cultural hub. This assembly of people from across Judah reflects the communal aspect of worship and repentance in ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The son of Josiah and king of Judah during this time.

The detail reminds us that Scripture roots God&#8217;s dealings in real time and space; this was no vague religious story but an event on the calendar. That same month is later mentioned when Jehoiakim burns Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll (<a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22</a>), showing how quickly the king&#8217;s hardness followed the people&#8217;s humility. Similar time-stamped moments appear elsewhere, underscoring God&#8217;s orderly timeline (<a href="/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the fifth year</b><p>The &#8220;fifth year&#8221; of Jehoiakim equals 604 B.C., the year after Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s first incursion (<a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>). Judah had already tasted Babylon&#8217;s might; fear and uncertainty filled the nation. God often allows political upheaval to press people toward repentance (<a href="/haggai/1-5.htm">Haggai 1:5-6</a>). The fast comes on the heels of Jeremiah&#8217;s command (<a href="/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2-3</a>) that his words be read so &#8220;each may turn from his wicked way.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah</b><p>Mentioning Jehoiakim right after his godly father Josiah highlights the tragic contrast. Josiah &#8220;walked in all the ways of David&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/22-2.htm">2 Kings 22:2</a>), but Jehoiakim &#8220;did evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/23-37.htm">2 Kings 23:37</a>). Jeremiah later condemns him for oppression and bloodshed (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-19</a>). The fast therefore unfolded under a monarch who personally spurned God, revealing that national repentance can begin with the people even when leaders resist&#8212;much like in <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> or <a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24-45</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a fast before the LORD was proclaimed</b><p>Fasting in Scripture is a heart-cry for mercy and change (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>). The phrase &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; shows the fast&#8217;s God-ward focus, not mere ritual. Given Babylon&#8217;s threat, the people likely sought deliverance (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3-4</a>). Yet fasting without obedience is empty; Jeremiah&#8217;s earlier sermon at the temple (<a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3-11</a>) had already called for tangible reform. The coming scroll reading (<a href="/jeremiah/36-6.htm">Jeremiah 36:6</a>) provides God&#8217;s answer to their fast, demonstrating that repentance must be guided by His word (<a href="/nehemiah/9-1.htm">Nehemiah 9:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to all the people of Jerusalem and all who had come there from the cities of Judah</b><p>The invitation was broad: city dwellers and out-of-towners alike. Corporate gatherings for repentance dot Israel&#8217;s story&#8212;see <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>, where &#8220;all the people of Nineveh&#8230;put on sackcloth,&#8221; or <a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>, where elders and inhabitants assemble. Jerusalem, God&#8217;s chosen city (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>), becomes the focal point for nationwide contrition. By drawing everyone together, the leaders acknowledged that sin and its consequences are communal, and so is the call to return (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a> captures a moment of urgent, collective humility: in the bleak ninth month of Jehoiakim&#8217;s turbulent fifth year, Judah proclaims a fast, gathering every corner of the land to seek the LORD. The date roots the event in history; the mention of Jehoiakim contrasts a wicked ruler with a people momentarily stirred toward repentance; the fast itself underscores God&#8217;s invitation to return; and the inclusion of all Judah reveals the communal nature of both sin and salvation. God responds by having Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll read aloud, demonstrating that genuine fasting must lead to hearing and obeying His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">It came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim.</span>--The LXX. gives "the <span class= "ital">eighth </span>year," but the Hebrew text gives much the more probable date. What follows refers apparently to the same occasion as <a href="/jeremiah/36-8.htm" title="And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.">Jeremiah 36:8</a>, and is of the nature of a note explaining the circumstances under which the prophetic discourse was read. An interval of some months thus passed between the writing of the book and its delivery in the Temple, during which its substance was, perhaps, made known to the inner circle of the prophet's disciples. The fast was probably proclaimed on the king's hearing of the approach of Nebuchadnezzar's army, as described by the Rechabites in <a href="/jeremiah/35-11.htm" title="But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 35:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the fifth year of Jehoiakim.</span> It is remarkable that the Septuagint has here the <span class="accented">eighth</span> year; and Josephus, too, relates that Jehoiakim paid tribute to Nebuchadnezzar in his eighth year. This latter statement seems to tally with the notices in <a href="/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>. The vassalage of Jehoiakim is there said to have lasted three years; this followed the rebellion; while the siege of Jerusalem was reserved for the short reign of Jehoiachin. Now, as this siege must have been the punishment of Jehoiakim's rebellion, and as the reign of the latter king lasted eleven years, we are brought to the same date as that given by Josephus for the commencement of the vassalage, viz. the eighth year. It is to this year, then, that <a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a> refers when it says, "In his days Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant;" and also the narrative before us in the statement that "they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem." What other event would have produced such a concourse of worshippers? The battle of Carchemish (which took place in the fourth year of Jehoiakim)? But it was by no means clear as yet that the consequences of this would be disastrous for Judah. Carchemish was too far off for the people of Judah to show such serious alarm (similarly Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' etc., vol. 23. p. 300). If so, Jeremiah kept his prophecy by him for several years, till the fight moment came. <span class="cmt_word">The ninth month.</span> As this is a winter month (see ver. 22), Jeremiah evidently reckons by the Babylonian calendar, the ninth month of which, Kisiluv (Hebrew, Chisleu), began from the new moon of December. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
