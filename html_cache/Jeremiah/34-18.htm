In the biblical context, a covenant is a solemn agreement between God and His people, often involving promises and obligations. The covenant in question likely refers to the Mosaic Covenant, which included the Law given at Sinai. Transgression of this covenant implies a serious breach of faith and disobedience to God's commands, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic books. The prophets often called the people back to faithfulness, highlighting the consequences of their disobedience.<p><b>and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before Me,</b><br>The terms of the covenant were clear and involved obedience to God's laws and commands. The phrase "before Me" emphasizes the solemnity and divine witness of the covenant. In ancient Near Eastern culture, covenants were binding agreements often ratified in the presence of deities, making them sacred and inviolable. The failure to fulfill these terms indicates a deliberate choice to ignore the responsibilities and commitments made to God, which is seen as a direct affront to His authority and holiness.<p><b>I will treat like the calf they cut in two</b><br>This imagery refers to an ancient covenant-making ceremony where animals were cut in half, and the parties involved would walk between the pieces. This act symbolized the seriousness of the covenant, implying that breaking it would result in a fate similar to that of the slaughtered animal. This practice is seen in <a href="/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9-10, 17</a>, where God makes a covenant with Abram. The cutting of the calf signifies the gravity of the agreement and the severe consequences of breaking it.<p><b>in order to pass between its pieces.</b><br>Passing between the pieces of the calf was a symbolic act of commitment and accountability. It was a way of invoking a curse upon oneself should the covenant be broken. This practice underscores the seriousness with which God views covenant fidelity. The imagery here serves as a powerful reminder of the consequences of unfaithfulness and the inevitable judgment that follows. It also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of covenant promises through Jesus Christ, who, unlike the people of Judah, perfectly fulfilled the terms of God's covenant and bore the curse of the broken covenant on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of the consequences of their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_of_judah.htm">The Men of Judah</a></b><br>These are the individuals who transgressed God's covenant, specifically the leaders and people who failed to uphold their promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_ceremony.htm">Covenant Ceremony</a></b><br>A solemn agreement made before God, symbolized by cutting a calf in two and passing between its pieces, signifying the seriousness of the commitment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_threat.htm">Babylonian Threat</a></b><br>The context of this passage is the impending Babylonian invasion, which serves as a backdrop for the urgency of the covenant renewal.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah at the time, who was involved in making and breaking the covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_covenants.htm">The Seriousness of Covenants</a></b><br>Covenants are solemn agreements that require faithfulness.

In Jeremiah&#8217;s day, Judah&#8217;s leaders had sworn to release their Hebrew slaves (<a href="/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>). They reversed course once the Babylonian siege lifted, trampling on their oath. Scripture consistently shows that breaking covenant with God is a serious offense: see <a href="/deuteronomy/29-25.htm">Deuteronomy 29:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-10.htm">Psalm 78:10</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before Me</b><p>The pledge was made &#8220;before Me,&#8221; reminding us that every promise is ultimately made in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>). Failure to keep it is not merely social injustice; it is sin against the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>; <a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God expects obedience, not partial compliance.<p>&#8226; He holds His people to the very words they spoke.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will treat like the calf they cut in two</b><p>Ancient covenants were ratified by dividing an animal and walking between the halves, symbolizing, &#8220;May this happen to me if I break the oath&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-10.htm">Genesis 15:10, 17</a>). Here, God declares He will enforce that self-maledictory curse.

The leaders of Judah broke their solemn vow to free their slaves; therefore, the Lord would bring on them the death-sentence they had symbolically accepted. The verse underscores the seriousness of every promise made before God, the certainty of His justice, and the call to wholehearted obedience to His revealed Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">When they cut the calf in twain . . .</span>--The passage is interesting, as showing the survival of one of the oldest rites of Patriarchal times. So, when Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, the victims that had been slain were cut up and arranged opposite each other, and when the "burning lamp" passed between the pieces it was the token that Jehovah had completed the covenant, even as men complete it (<a href="/context/genesis/15-10.htm" title="And he took to him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.">Genesis 15:10-17</a>). The implied thought thus symbolised was that the parties to the contract prayed, as in the analogous case of <a href="/1_samuel/11-7.htm" title="And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.">1Samuel 11:7</a>, that they might be torn limb from limb like the victims if they broke the covenant, The antiquity and wide extent of the symbolism is shown by its appearing in the ritual of Greece, as in the phrase <span class= "greekheb">????? ??????</span> --to ratify (literally, to <span class= "ital">cut</span>) oaths, in Homer (<span class= "ital">Iliad, ii.</span> 124, <span class= "ital">Od. </span>xxiv. 483, and elsewhere), and the Latin <span class= "ital">f?dus ferire. </span>In Livy (i. 24) we have both the phrase, the act which it implied, and the prayer which accompanied it, that if the Roman people proved unfaithful to their covenant Jupiter would slay them as the priest slew the victim. "<span class= "ital">Tu illo die, Jupiter, populum Romanum sic ferito, ut ego hunc porcum hic hodie feriam, tantoque magis ferito, quanto magis potes pollesque." </span>("Do thou, Jupiter, on that day so smite the Roman people [if they break the covenant] as I this day smite this swine--yea, so much the more smite them as thou art mightier and more prevailing.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they out the calf in twain,</span> etc. This clause should be translated differently, and placed, for clearness, in a parenthesis (<span class="accented">the calf which they cut in twain, and between the parts of which they passed</span>). The division of the calf might, in fact, be called in Hebrew either "the covenant" or "the token of the covenant" (comp. <a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10, 11</a>). It was a solemn assurance that he who should transgress God's Law should share the same fate as the victim. The same idea seems to have dictated the Hebrew phrase, "to <span class="accented">cut</span> a covenant," and the Greek and Latin equivalents (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">foedus icere</span>);
