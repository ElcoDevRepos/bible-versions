Moab was often in conflict with Israel, and its people were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>). The use of "woe" indicates a lamentation or a severe warning of impending doom. This judgment is consistent with other prophetic declarations against nations that opposed Israel (Isaiah 15-16, <a href="/amos/2.htm">Amos 2:1-3</a>).<p><b>The people of Chemosh have perished;</b><br>Chemosh was the national deity of the Moabites, often associated with war and destruction. The mention of Chemosh highlights the spiritual apostasy of Moab, as they relied on a false god for protection. This phrase indicates the futility of trusting in idols, as seen in other scriptures where God demonstrates His power over false gods (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>). The perishing of Chemosh's people signifies the complete overthrow of Moab's religious and cultural identity.<p><b>for your sons have been taken into exile</b><br>Exile was a common consequence for nations defeated in ancient times, often used to break the spirit and continuity of a people. The taking of sons into exile represents the loss of future generations and the strength of the nation. This is reminiscent of the Babylonian exile of Judah, where the people were removed from their land as a form of divine judgment (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>).<p><b>and your daughters have gone into captivity.</b><br>The captivity of daughters underscores the totality of Moab's defeat, affecting both men and women. In ancient cultures, the capture of women often implied a loss of honor and security for the nation. This phrase reflects the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, as seen in other prophetic writings where both genders suffer the consequences of national sin (<a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-26</a>). The captivity of daughters also symbolizes the end of Moab's lineage and cultural continuity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

The verse affirms that idolatry cannot save, divine justice is impartial, and national pride leads to ruin. At the same time, the broader context shows God still offers restoration to those who turn to Him.
