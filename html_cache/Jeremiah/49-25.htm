Historically, Damascus was a center of trade and culture, often praised for its beauty and strategic importance. The rhetorical question highlights the surprise and disbelief that such a renowned city could face desolation. In biblical context, cities often symbolize human pride and achievement, and their downfall serves as a reminder of divine sovereignty. The phrase suggests a contrast between the city's former glory and its impending judgment, reflecting themes found in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel, where cities are often depicted as falling due to their sinfulness.<p><b>the town that brings Me joy?</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the personal relationship between God and the city, indicating that Damascus once held a place of favor or joy in God's eyes. The use of "joy" suggests a deeper connection, possibly alluding to the city's role in God's plans or its past righteousness. However, the impending judgment implies that this joy has been overshadowed by the city's current state of sin or rebellion. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative where God expresses sorrow over the fall of places and people He once delighted in, similar to His lament over Jerusalem in the Gospels. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of human glory and the enduring nature of divine judgment and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The city referred to in this passage, known historically as a significant and influential city in the ancient Near East.

A difficult passage. The construction, indeed, is plain. "How is not," etc. I can only mean "How is it that the city of praise is not," etc.?(comp. <a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14</a>). The difficulty lies in the word rendered "left." The ordinary meaning of the verb, when applied to cities, is certainly "to leave without inhabitants;" <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm">Isaiah 7:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>. This, however, does not suit the context, which shows that "the daughter of Damascus" personified is the speaker, so that ver. 25 ought rather to mean, "How is it that the city of praise <span class="accented">is</span> [not, '<span class="accented">is not'</span>] forsaken?" Either, then, we must suppose that "not" has been inserted by mistake - a too arbitrary step, seeing that there is no negative in the context to account for the insertion (the case is different, therefore, from <a href="/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>; <a href="/job/27-15.htm">Job 27:15</a>, where such an insertion is at any rate justifiable); or else we must give <span class="accented">uzzebhah</span> the sense of "let go free" (comp. <a href="/exodus/23-5.htm">Exodus 23:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>).
