The imagery of a "shattered pot" reflects his broken and rejected status, symbolizing the loss of his royal dignity and authority. In ancient Near Eastern culture, pottery was a common metaphor for human frailty and divine judgment. This phrase suggests that Coniah's reign and legacy are irreparably damaged, aligning with the prophetic tradition of using pottery to signify destruction (<a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-11</a>).<p><b>a jar that no one wants?</b><br>The metaphor of an unwanted jar emphasizes Coniah's rejection by both God and his people. In the cultural context, a jar that is no longer useful is discarded, symbolizing the end of Coniah's rule and the severing of his lineage from the Davidic promise. This rejection is significant in the broader narrative of Israel's kingship, where the failure to adhere to God's covenant leads to divine disfavor. The imagery also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic line in Jesus Christ, who is the desired and chosen vessel of God's salvation.<p><b>Why are he and his descendants hurled out</b><br>The phrase "hurled out" indicates a forceful removal, reflecting the severity of God's judgment. Coniah and his descendants were exiled to Babylon, fulfilling the prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah and other prophets. This exile serves as a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking the transition from the Davidic monarchy to a period of foreign domination. Theologically, it underscores the consequences of covenant unfaithfulness and the need for repentance and restoration.<p><b>and cast into a land they do not know?</b><br>Being cast into an unfamiliar land highlights the dislocation and disorientation experienced by the exiles. Babylon, a foreign and pagan land, represents both physical and spiritual exile from the Promised Land. This displacement fulfills earlier prophecies about the consequences of Israel's disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>). The exile also sets the stage for the eventual return and restoration, pointing to the hope of redemption and the coming of a new covenant through Jesus Christ, who reconciles humanity to God and restores the broken relationship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>Also known as Coniah or Jeconiah, he was a king of Judah who reigned for a brief period before being taken captive by the Babylonians.

Though born into David&#8217;s royal line, he followed the sins of his fathers, ignoring the covenant and the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24-26</a>). The question sounds almost rhetorical: &#8220;Is this man Coniah&#8230;?&#8221; The implied answer is yes&#8212;he has forfeited the privileges of kingship. God&#8217;s verdict shows that pedigree alone does not guarantee blessing; faithful obedience does (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>; <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39-40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a despised and shattered pot</b><p>Jeremiah had earlier smashed a clay jar before the elders to picture Judah&#8217;s coming ruin (<a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-11</a>). Now the Lord likens Coniah to that broken vessel.<p>&#8226; Broken pottery cannot be repaired&#8212;symbolizing irreversible judgment (<a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;despised&#8221; underscores rejection by both God and people (<a href="/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The image recalls the potter-and-clay lessons of <a href="/jeremiah/18-1.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>, where the vessel becomes unusable when it resists the potter&#8217;s design. Coniah resisted God&#8217;s shaping hand, so he is shattered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a jar that no one wants?</b><p>An unwanted jar has no practical value; it is tossed aside. Similarly, Coniah is deemed unfit to lead the covenant nation. <a href="/romans/9-21.htm">Romans 9:21</a> notes the difference between &#8220;honorable&#8221; and &#8220;common&#8221; vessels, and <a href="/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20</a> urges believers to be &#8220;vessels for honor.&#8221; Coniah illustrates the opposite: a vessel dishonored by disobedience (<a href="/hosea/8-8.htm">Hosea 8:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why are he and his descendants hurled out</b><p>The Lord explains the &#8220;why&#8221; throughout <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/22.htm">Jeremiah 22</a>:<p>&#8226; Coniah&#8217;s father Jehoiakim &#8220;shed innocent blood&#8221; and &#8220;practiced oppression&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Both father and son ignored God&#8217;s call to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the king leads the nation, his rebellion brings collective consequences (<a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36-37</a>).<p>The hurling motif shows forceful removal; God personally expels them, fulfilling His warning that unfaithful rulers would be thrust from office (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cast into a land they do not know?</b><p>Jehoiachin and his household were deported to Babylon in 597 BC (<a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15-16</a>). Exile was no accident; it fulfilled covenant curses pronounced centuries earlier: &#8220;The LORD will bring you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;a land they do not know&#8221; emphasizes alienation&#8212;far from the temple, the people, and the promises (<a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even in exile God preserved a remnant and promised restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Remarkably, though Coniah&#8217;s royal line was cut off from the throne (<a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>), God later wove his genealogy into the messianic line culminating in Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-11.htm">Matthew 1:11-12</a>), demonstrating both judgment and grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a> portrays Coniah as a broken, unwanted vessel&#8212;a vivid picture of divine judgment on a king who rejected God&#8217;s rule. His downfall shows that heritage without holiness leads to ruin, and that God keeps His covenant warnings as surely as His promises. Even in exile, the Lord remained sovereign, working through judgment to advance His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a broken piece of handiwork. </span>The word is not the same as that elsewhere rendered "idol," though connected with it, and the imagery which underlies the words is not that of an idol which men have worshipped and flung away, but of the potter (as in <a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm" title="And shall say to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.">Jeremiah 19:11</a>) rejecting and breaking what his own hands have made.

The question implies an affirmative answer. The prophet speaks as identifying himself with those who gazed with wonder and pity at the doom which fell on one so young, and yet not the less does he pronounce that doom to be inevitable.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is this man Coniah</span>, etc.? The prophet's human feelings are stirred; he cannot withhold his sympathy from the sad fate of his king. What! he exclaims; is it possible that this Coniah is treated as a piece of ill-wrought pottery ware (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/18-4.htm">Jeremiah 18:4</a>), and "hurled" into a strange land? <span class="cmt_word">He and his seed</span>. These words have caused some difficulty, owing to the youth, of Jehoiachin. According to <a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a> he was only eighteen when he was carried captive, while <a href="/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> makes him still younger, only eight (Josiah's age on his accession). Hitzig thinks the latter number is to be preferred; his chief reasons are the prominence given to the queen-mother, and the fact that the length of Jehoiachin's reign is given with more precise accuracy in 2 Chronicles than in 2 Kings. It is true that the king's wives are mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. But that he had wives may, according to Hitzig, have been inferred by the late compiler of Kings from the passage before us; or the "wives" may have been those of Jehoiachin's predecessor (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>). Graf's conjecture is, perhaps, the safest view of the case, whether we accept the number eighteen or the number eight; it is that the "seed" spoken of as born to Jehoiachin in his captivity, and is reckoned to him by anticipation. It should be mentioned, however, that the Septuagint omits "he and his seed" altogether. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Is this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
