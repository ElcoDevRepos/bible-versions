This month is significant in the Jewish calendar as it includes important festivals such as the Feast of Trumpets (Rosh Hashanah), the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), and the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot). These festivals are times of reflection, repentance, and celebration, which may underscore the gravity of Hananiah's death as a divine judgment during a spiritually significant period.<p><b>of that very year</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the immediacy of the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy against Hananiah. Earlier in the chapter, Jeremiah prophesied that Hananiah would die within the year for falsely prophesying peace (<a href="/jeremiah/28-16.htm">Jeremiah 28:16</a>). The fulfillment within the same year serves as a testament to the accuracy and authority of Jeremiah's prophetic word, contrasting the false assurances given by Hananiah.<p><b>the prophet Hananiah</b><br>Hananiah is identified as a prophet, though he is a false one. His actions in <a href="/jeremiah/28.htm">Jeremiah 28</a>, where he breaks the yoke off Jeremiah's neck and proclaims a false message of peace, demonstrate the danger of false prophecy. His role as a prophet highlights the responsibility and accountability of those who claim to speak for God. His death serves as a warning against misleading God's people and underscores the seriousness of speaking presumptuously in God's name.<p><b>died</b><br>The death of Hananiah is a direct fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy and serves as a divine judgment against him for his false prophecies. This event underscores the theme of divine retribution and the seriousness with which God views the integrity of His word. It also serves as a validation of Jeremiah's true prophetic ministry. The death of a false prophet is a sobering reminder of the consequences of leading people astray and the ultimate triumph of truth over deception.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
