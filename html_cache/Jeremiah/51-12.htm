Babylon, a symbol of human pride and idolatry, is under divine judgment. The walls of Babylon were considered impregnable, yet God&#8217;s command to raise a banner signifies the certainty of its fall. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>, where a banner is raised on a bare hilltop, signaling the gathering of nations against Babylon. The banner represents God's authority and the impending judgment.<p><b>post the guard;</b><br>Posting a guard indicates preparation and vigilance. In the context of Babylon's impending doom, it suggests that the attackers are to be ready and alert. Historically, Babylon was a fortified city with strong defenses, but the divine directive to post guards underscores the inevitability of its capture. This reflects the biblical theme of watchfulness, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>, where the prophet is appointed as a watchman for Israel.<p><b>station the watchmen;</b><br>Watchmen were crucial in ancient cities for early warning of approaching danger. Here, the watchmen are stationed as part of the divine strategy against Babylon. This action symbolizes the readiness and anticipation of God's judgment. The role of watchmen is also a spiritual metaphor, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>, where watchmen are placed on Jerusalem's walls to pray and intercede continually.<p><b>prepare the ambush.</b><br>An ambush involves surprise and strategic planning. The preparation of an ambush against Babylon indicates a well-orchestrated divine plan. Historically, Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians through a surprise attack, fulfilling this prophecy. The concept of an ambush reflects God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His word, as seen in the unexpected ways He often accomplishes His purposes.<p><b>For the LORD has both devised and accomplished what He spoke against the people of Babylon.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and faithfulness in executing His plans. The fall of Babylon was prophesied by Jeremiah and other prophets, such as Isaiah and Daniel. God's devising and accomplishing highlight His omnipotence and the certainty of His word. This assurance is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning, fulfilling His purpose. The judgment on Babylon serves as a type of the ultimate judgment on all worldly systems opposed to God, pointing to the final victory of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and the surrounding nations, including Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>An ancient city and empire known for its wealth, power, and opposition to God's people.

The preposition for "upon" may, however, mean <span class= "ital">against</span>, and this agrees better with the context. The "standards" are the banners or signals that direct an attack on a given point of the walls. The "watch" and "watchmen" are the scouts and sentinels placed to give notice of any attempt at a sally on the part of the besieged. The "ambush" may indicate generally any sudden attack, or, more specifically, the stratagem of a feigned flight, like that employed by Joshua in the attack on Ai (<a href="/context/joshua/8-14.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.">Joshua 8:14-16</a>; comp. <a href="/context/judges/20-33.htm" title="And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.">Judges 20:33-35</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the walls of Babylon;</span> rather, <span class="accented">toward the walls</span> (as <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>).
