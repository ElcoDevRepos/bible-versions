This reflects the historical context of ancient Near Eastern cultures, where polytheism was prevalent. The Israelites often adopted the gods of surrounding nations, despite the first commandment prohibiting such practices (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This rhetorical question underscores the futility of worshipping idols, which are powerless and cannot provide salvation or deliverance (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>).<p><b>Let them rise up in your time of trouble and save you if they can;</b><br>Here, God challenges the efficacy of these idols, emphasizing their inability to act or intervene in times of crisis. This is a common theme in prophetic literature, where the impotence of idols is contrasted with the power of the true God (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>). The phrase also serves as a call to repentance, urging the people to recognize their misplaced trust and return to God, who alone can save (<a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20-22</a>).<p><b>for your gods are as numerous as your cities, O Judah.</b><br>This hyperbolic statement illustrates the extent of Judah's idolatry, with each city having its own deity or shrine. It reflects the historical reality of syncretism, where local deities were often worshipped alongside Yahweh. The proliferation of idols is a sign of spiritual decay and covenant unfaithfulness, as the people abandoned the exclusive worship of Yahweh (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). This situation is reminiscent of the time of the Judges, when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>), leading to moral and social chaos.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The people had fashioned idols&#8212;hand-crafted substitutes for the living God&#8212;and trusted them for daily provision and national security.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37-38</a>, God predicted this very moment: &#8220;He will say, &#8216;Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge&#8230; let them rise up and help you.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/10-14.htm">Judges 10:14</a> echoes the same irony when the Lord tells Israel, &#8220;Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The prophet is not genuinely searching for the idols; he&#8217;s highlighting their absence. An idol cannot answer because, as <a href="/psalms/115-5.htm">Psalm 115:5-7</a> notes, it &#8220;has a mouth but cannot speak&#8230; feet, but it cannot walk.&#8221;<p>The point is clear: anything crafted by human hands or imagination is powerless when true need arises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let them rise up in your time of trouble and save you if they can</b><p>God challenges the nation to test the worth of their idols under real-world pressure.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a> pictures people lifting an idol &#8220;on their shoulders&#8221; and setting it in place&#8212;yet it &#8220;cannot answer or save them from their troubles.&#8221;<p>&#8226; When calamity strikes, an idol must be carried; it cannot carry you. This underscores the folly of shifting allegiance from the Creator (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>) to created images.<p>&#8226; The same principle shows up in <a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a> when Baal&#8217;s prophets cried out from morning till noon, but &#8220;there was no voice and no one answered.&#8221;<p>God&#8217;s challenge is not cruel; it is corrective. He wants His people to feel the emptiness of false refuge so they will return to Him, the only true Savior (<a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For your gods are as numerous as your cities, O Judah</b><p>Idolatry had become so widespread that every city&#8212;and in some cases every household&#8212;had its own deity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a> states, &#8220;You have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah,&#8221; confirming the nation&#8217;s saturation with idols.<p>&#8226; This multiplication reveals how quickly one compromise breeds another. Instead of being a &#8220;kingdom of priests&#8221; pointing nations to Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), Judah mirrored the pagan world around her.<p>&#8226; The abundance of idols did not bring increased security; it produced deeper fragmentation, moral confusion, and divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/5-19.htm">Jeremiah 5:19</a>).<p>God&#8217;s indictment highlights the absurdity: the more idols they amassed, the less protection they experienced.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/2-28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a> exposes the futility of trusting anything or anyone other than the Lord. Manufactured gods&#8212;whether literal statues or modern substitutes of wealth, power, or pleasure&#8212;cannot answer in crisis.

True, Manasseh's reactionary reign had intervened, but his counter-movement would not have been so successful had it not been attended by the good wishes of the people; and besides, the last years of Manasseh, according to the tradition in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-16</a> were devoted to undoing the mischief of his former life. The force of the prophet's words is strikingly brought out by M. Renan (he led an expedition to Phoenicia), who has shown that every district and every town had a cultus of its own, which often only differed from the neighboring cultus by words and titles (<span class="accented">nomina</span>, <span class="accented">numina</span>); comp.
