Wisdom in the Old Testament is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The rhetorical question implies that true wisdom comes from God and is not easily attained by human means. This echoes the call for discernment found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, where believers are encouraged to ask God for wisdom.<p><b>To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may explain it?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the role of prophets as God's chosen messengers. In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet is often the one through whom God communicates His will and judgment. The "mouth of the LORD" signifies divine revelation, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic books. This also points to the authority of Scripture as God's spoken word, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, where all Scripture is described as God-breathed.<p><b>Why is the land destroyed and scorched like a desert, so no one can pass through it?</b><br>This phrase refers to the consequences of Israel's disobedience and idolatry. The destruction of the land is a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>, where disobedience leads to desolation. The imagery of a scorched desert highlights the severity of God's judgment. Historically, this reflects the Babylonian invasion and exile, which left the land desolate. Theologically, it serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God, a theme that resonates throughout the prophetic writings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

God looks for someone who possesses true, godly wisdom&#8212;wisdom rooted in &#8220;the fear of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet implies that such wisdom is rare; the nation&#8217;s leaders, priests, and prophets have largely abandoned it (<a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine wisdom means seeing events through God&#8217;s revealed viewpoint (<a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a>). The impending judgment is not random; it is the predictable outcome of covenant disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-28.htm">Deuteronomy 32:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse prods every hearer: will anyone rise above the prevailing blindness and grasp what God is doing?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may explain it?</b><p>&#8220;To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may explain it?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>b)<p>&#8226; The &#8220;mouth of the LORD&#8221; is His direct revelation through the prophets (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). The question points to the scarcity of faithful messengers willing to relay God&#8217;s interpretation of events (<a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophetic revelation is essential because human reasoning alone cannot decode divine judgment (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah himself is that spokesman, yet the people refuse to listen (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-27</a>). Their rejection proves they prefer flattery over truth (<a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting the need for a God-commissioned explainer, the verse underscores Scripture&#8217;s authority: only God&#8217;s Word tells us what calamities mean and how to respond (<a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why is the land destroyed and scorched like a desert, so no one can pass through it?</b><p>&#8220;Why is the land destroyed and scorched like a desert, so no one can pass through it?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>c)<p>&#8226; The devastation depicts the curses Moses warned of when Israel broke covenant&#8212;famine, desolation, enemy invasion (<a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31-33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Historically this points to Babylon&#8217;s advance, turning Judah&#8217;s once-fruitful fields into wasteland (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The land&#8217;s ruin mirrors the people&#8217;s spiritual barrenness:<p>&#8211; They &#8220;walked after the stubbornness of their own hearts&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>).<p>&#8211; They &#8220;taught their tongues to lie&#8221; and &#8220;grew weary of doing wrong&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/9-5.htm">Jeremiah 9:5</a>).<p>&#8211; They forsook God&#8217;s law and followed Baals (<a href="/jeremiah/9-13.htm">Jeremiah 9:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgment is therefore both just and literal. What He promised in His Word He now performs (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a> asks three piercing questions. First, is anyone truly wise&#8212;wise enough to read God&#8217;s handwriting on the wall? Second, who will let God speak through him and faithfully explain His purposes? Third, can the people grasp why their land lies in smoking ruin? The answers converge: wisdom comes from fearing God, understanding flows from receiving His revealed Word, and devastation falls because the nation spurned both. Scripture proves accurate and literal; covenant violations bring covenant curses. Yet even this stern passage invites hearers today to seek divine wisdom, heed God&#8217;s mouth, and walk in obedience so that blessing, not desolation, marks the land.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Who is the wise man . . .?</span>--Sage (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/8-9.htm" title="The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: see, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?">Jeremiah 8:9</a>) and prophet are alike called on to state why the misery of which Jeremiah speaks is to come upon the people.
