The beauty and delicacy highlight Jerusalem's significance and splendor, both in its physical appearance and its spiritual heritage as the center of worship for the Israelites. Historically, Jerusalem was a city of great architectural beauty, with Solomon's Temple being a focal point of its grandeur. The description of beauty and delicacy also underscores the vulnerability of Jerusalem, despite its outward appearance. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical passages where cities or nations are depicted as women, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a> and <a href="/lamentations/1-6.htm">Lamentations 1:6</a>, emphasizing their vulnerability and the impending judgment due to their sins.<p><b>I will destroy the Daughter of Zion</b><br>"Daughter of Zion" is a term used to refer to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, emphasizing their relationship with God as His chosen people. The phrase "I will destroy" indicates a divine judgment that is imminent due to the people's persistent disobedience and idolatry. This judgment is consistent with the covenantal warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's faithfulness to God. The destruction prophesied here was fulfilled historically with the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. This event serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. Theologically, it also points to the need for repentance and the hope of restoration, as seen in later prophecies of a new covenant and the coming of the Messiah, who would ultimately restore and redeem the people of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

This passage is one of the most difficult in the book, and if there is corruption of the text anywhere, it is here. The most generally adopted rendering is, "The comely and delicate one will I destroy, even the daughter of Zion," giving the verb the same sense as in <a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a> (literally it is, <span class="accented">I have brought to silence</span>, or perfect of prophetic certitude). The context, however, seems to favor the rendering "pasturage" (including the idea of a nomad settlement), instead of "comely;" but how to make this fit in with the remainder of the existing text is far from clear. The true and original reading probably only survives in fragments.
