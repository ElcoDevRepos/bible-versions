Historically, Jerusalem was the location of the Temple, the focal point of Jewish worship. The cities of Judah and surrounding areas were expected to gather here for religious observance, emphasizing unity and communal worship. This pilgrimage reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where Jerusalem serves as the heart of worship and obedience.<p><b>from the land of Benjamin</b><br>The land of Benjamin, located just north of Jerusalem, was one of the twelve tribes of Israel. This inclusion signifies the reunification and participation of all tribes in worship, despite historical divisions. Benjamin's proximity to Jerusalem made it a significant contributor to the religious life of the nation. The tribe of Benjamin also has historical significance, as it was the tribe of King Saul, Israel's first king, and later, the Apostle Paul.<p><b>and from the foothills, the hill country, and the Negev</b><br>These geographical regions represent the diverse topography of Judah, from the lowlands to the mountainous areas and the arid southern desert. The mention of these areas underscores the inclusivity of worship, inviting people from all parts of the land to participate in the religious life centered in Jerusalem. This diversity also reflects the varied lifestyles and challenges faced by the inhabitants, yet they are united in their devotion to God.<p><b>bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices</b><br>Burnt offerings and sacrifices were central to the Old Testament worship system, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. These offerings were a means of maintaining a right relationship with God, acknowledging sin, and expressing devotion. The sacrificial system pointed forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law and provided a once-for-all atonement for sin.<p><b>grain offerings and frankincense</b><br>Grain offerings, often accompanied by frankincense, were expressions of thanksgiving and dedication. They represented the fruits of labor and God's provision, acknowledging His sovereignty and blessing. Frankincense, a costly and fragrant resin, was used in worship to symbolize prayer and the pleasing aroma of a life dedicated to God. These offerings highlight the importance of gratitude and the acknowledgment of God's provision in daily life.<p><b>and thank offerings to the house of the LORD</b><br>Thank offerings were voluntary expressions of gratitude for God's blessings and deliverance. They were part of the peace offerings, symbolizing fellowship with God and others. The house of the LORD, the Temple, was the designated place for these offerings, signifying God's presence among His people. This practice foreshadows the New Testament teaching of offering oneself as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, as an act of spiritual worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_judah.htm">Cities of Judah</a></b><br>Refers to the various urban centers within the territory of Judah, the southern kingdom of Israel, known for its capital, Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of worship for the Israelites, where the temple of the LORD was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_benjamin.htm">Land of Benjamin</a></b><br>A region north of Judah, belonging to the tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foothills,_hill_country,_and_negev.htm">Foothills, Hill Country, and Negev</a></b><br>These are geographical regions in Israel.

(1) The "plain" (<span class= "ital">Shephelah</span>) is the lowland country of Philistia, stretching to the Mediterranean; the "mountain" the hill-country of Judah; the "south" (<span class= "ital">Negeb</span>) the region lying to the south of Hebron, and including Beersheba (comp. <a href="/joshua/15-21.htm" title="And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,">Joshua 15:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-28.htm" title="And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,">Joshua 15:28</a>). Each name, though descriptive in meaning, was used in almost as definite a sense as that in which we speak of the "Campagna" of Rome or the "Weald" of Kent. (2) The list includes the <span class= "ital">"</span>burnt offerings," in which the flesh of the victim was consumed entirely on the altar; the "sacrifices," in which the flesh of the victim was eaten partly by the priest and partly by the worshipper; the "meat offerings," which were of meal and salt, not of flesh, and were always accompanied by incense (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1</a>); and, lastly, praise--the word "sacrifice" not being found in the Hebrew--the utterance of prayer and psalm, which the Psalmist had named as more acceptable than the flesh of bulls and goats (<a href="/psalms/50-14.htm" title="Offer to God thanksgiving; and pay your vows to the most High:">Psalm 50:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - Parallel passage for the catalogue of the districts of Judah, <a href="/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>.
