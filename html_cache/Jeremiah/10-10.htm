In the context of ancient Israel, surrounded by polytheistic cultures, this declaration asserts monotheism. The Hebrew word for "true" (&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1462;&#1514;, emet) conveys faithfulness and reliability, attributes of God that are consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35</a>, <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>). This statement also serves as a reminder of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>He is the living God</b><br>The term "living God" distinguishes the LORD from lifeless idols. Unlike idols made of wood and stone, God is active and dynamic, involved in the lives of His people. This concept is echoed in other parts of the Bible, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a> and <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>, where God is portrayed as vibrant and life-giving. The living God is also a source of life, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where He breathes life into man.<p><b>and eternal King.</b><br>The phrase "eternal King" highlights God's sovereignty and timeless reign. Unlike earthly kings whose rule is temporary, God's kingship is everlasting (<a href="/psalms/10-16.htm">Psalm 10:16</a>, <a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a>). This eternal aspect of God's nature assures believers of His unchanging authority and governance over all creation. The title "King" also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is referred to as King of Kings in <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>.<p><b>The earth quakes at His wrath,</b><br>This imagery of the earth quaking signifies the power and might of God's anger against sin and idolatry. It reflects the theophany at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>) and other instances where God's presence causes physical manifestations in nature (<a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>). The quaking earth serves as a metaphor for the upheaval that God's judgment brings upon the world, emphasizing His control over creation.<p><b>and the nations cannot endure His indignation.</b><br>This phrase underscores the universality of God's judgment. No nation, regardless of its power or influence, can withstand His righteous anger. This is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, where God's judgment is portrayed as inevitable and all-encompassing (<a href="/isaiah/34-2.htm">Isaiah 34:2</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>). It serves as a warning to the nations to turn from their ways and acknowledge the sovereignty of God. This also points to the eschatological judgment where all nations will be held accountable before God (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.
