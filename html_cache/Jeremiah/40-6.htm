Gedaliah, appointed by the Babylonians as governor over the remnant in Judah, was the son of Ahikam, who had previously protected Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>). This connection suggests a level of trust and safety for Jeremiah. Gedaliah's leadership was intended to stabilize the region after the Babylonian conquest, and Jeremiah's presence would have been seen as a sign of support for this new administration.<p><b>at Mizpah</b><br>Mizpah was a significant location in the history of Israel, often serving as a gathering place for the people (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-6</a>). It was strategically located north of Jerusalem, making it a suitable administrative center after the fall of the city. Archaeological findings suggest Mizpah was fortified, which would have provided a secure environment for Gedaliah's governance. The choice of Mizpah as a base reflects its historical and strategic importance.<p><b>and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land</b><br>This phrase highlights the remnant theme prevalent in the prophetic literature. The "people who were left" refers to those not taken into exile, often the poorer population (<a href="/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>). Jeremiah's decision to stay with them underscores his commitment to ministering to the remnant and his role as a shepherd to God's people, even in their reduced state. This action aligns with the prophetic message of hope and restoration for those who remain faithful. It also prefigures the New Testament theme of Jesus Christ's ministry to the marginalized and His promise of spiritual restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
