The temple was central to Jewish worship and identity, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with Israel. The phrase "bears My Name" indicates the temple's sanctity and the divine authority associated with it. The temple was meant to be a place of prayer and worship, as seen in Solomon's dedication prayer (<a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). The misuse of the temple for unjust purposes is a violation of its sacred purpose.<p><b>become a den of robbers in your sight?</b><br>The term "den of robbers" suggests a place where thieves retreat after committing their crimes. This imagery implies that the people were using the temple as a cover for their sinful behavior, thinking they could find refuge there despite their unrighteousness. This phrase is echoed in the New Testament when Jesus cleanses the temple (<a href="/matthew/21-13.htm">Matthew 21:13</a>, <a href="/mark/11-17.htm">Mark 11:17</a>, <a href="/luke/19-46.htm">Luke 19:46</a>), highlighting the continuity of God's concern for true worship and justice. The people's actions were hypocritical, as they engaged in idolatry and injustice while believing the temple rituals would protect them.<p><b>Yes, I too have seen it,</b><br>God's declaration that He has seen their actions emphasizes His omniscience and the fact that nothing is hidden from Him. This serves as a warning that God is aware of the people's hypocrisy and the corruption within the temple. It underscores the futility of attempting to deceive God with outward religious observance while living in disobedience. This is consistent with other biblical passages that highlight God's awareness of human actions and intentions (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "declares the LORD" affirms the authority and finality of the message. It is a prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to signify that the words spoken are not merely the prophet's but are directly from God. This adds weight to the warning and calls the people to repentance. The use of God's covenant name, "LORD" (YHWH), reminds the audience of their special relationship with God and the responsibilities that come with it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The Temple, honored with His Name, had turned into a refuge for thieves who assumed rituals could shield them from consequences. God exposes the sham, affirms He has witnessed every deed, and issues a solemn declaration. The passage calls every generation to match outward worship with inward obedience, remembering that the One who sees all will ultimately vindicate His holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">A den of robbers.</span>--The words had a special force in a country like Palestine, where the limestone rocks presented many caves, which, like that of Adullam (<a href="/context/1_samuel/22-1.htm" title="David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.">1Samuel 22:1-2</a>), were the refuge of outlaws and robbers. Those who now flocked to the courts of the Temple, including even priests and prophets, were as such robbers, finding shelter there, and soothing their consciences by their worship, as the brigands of Italy do by their devotions at the shrine of some favourite Madonna. It had for them no higher sanctity than "a den of robbers." The word for "robber" implies the more violent form of lawless plunder. The words are memorable, as having re-appeared in our Lord's rebuke of the money-changers and traffickers in the Temple (<a href="/matthew/21-13.htm" title="And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer;
