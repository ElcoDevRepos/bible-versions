This phrase indicates that God is providing a tangible proof of His intentions. Signs in the Bible often served as a means to strengthen faith or to warn of impending judgment, as seen in the story of Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>) or the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-11).<p><b>that I will punish you in this place</b><br>The context here is the disobedience of the Jewish remnant in Egypt, who fled there against God's command. "This place" refers to Egypt, where the Jews sought refuge. Historically, Egypt was often seen as a place of refuge, but God had warned against returning there (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>). The punishment signifies God's judgment on their idolatry and disobedience, similar to His judgments on Israel and Judah for their sins.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and certainty of the message. It is a common prophetic formula that underscores that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) highlights the covenant relationship and the seriousness of breaking it.<p><b>so that you may know</b><br>Knowledge in the biblical sense often implies experiential understanding. God desires that His people recognize His sovereignty and justice. This phrase suggests that the coming events will serve as undeniable evidence of God's power and truth, similar to how the Israelites came to know God through the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>).<p><b>that My threats of harm against you will surely stand</b><br>The certainty of God's word is a recurring theme in Scripture. His threats or warnings are not empty; they are as sure as His promises. This reflects the principle found in <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, where God is described as one who does not lie or change His mind. The fulfillment of these threats serves as a sobering reminder of God's holiness and justice, and it foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will come upon all who reject His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Jeremiah to deliver His message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's prophecy, specifically those who fled to Egypt against God's command.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place where the remnant of Judah fled, seeking refuge from Babylonian conquest, despite God's warnings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sign.htm">The Sign</a></b><br>A prophetic indication given by God through Jeremiah to confirm the certainty of His words and forthcoming judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_word.htm">The Certainty of God's Word</a></b><br>God's words are sure and will come to pass, whether for blessing or judgment.

It proves that He Himself is speaking, that judgment will land precisely where they thought they were safe, and that every warning He utters is unbreakable.
