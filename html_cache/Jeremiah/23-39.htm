In the biblical context, forgetting is not merely a lapse in memory but a deliberate act of removing one's presence and blessings. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brought blessings and disobedience led to curses (Deuteronomy 28). The use of "surely" emphasizes the certainty and seriousness of this judgment. It serves as a warning to the people who have persistently turned away from God despite numerous prophetic warnings.<p><b>and will cast you out of My presence</b><br>Being cast out of God's presence signifies a severe form of judgment, as God's presence was central to Israel's identity and security. This echoes the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>), symbolizing separation from divine fellowship due to sin. In the historical context, this foreshadows the Babylonian exile, where the people of Judah were physically removed from the land God had given them. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of idolatry and false prophecy, which were rampant during Jeremiah's time.<p><b>both you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers</b><br>The mention of "the city" refers to Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel. Jerusalem held significant importance as the location of the Temple, where God's presence dwelt among His people. The phrase "that I gave to you and your fathers" highlights the gift of the Promised Land, a fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This underscores the gravity of the people's unfaithfulness, as they are at risk of losing not only their land but also their heritage and the promises associated with it. The historical context of this passage is the impending Babylonian conquest, which would lead to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 586 BC, fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecy.<div

&#8220;Therefore&#8221; points back to the whole chapter, where counterfeit prophets have twisted God&#8217;s words (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-22</a>). Their persistent deception leaves God no alternative but judgment.<p>&#8226; To &#8220;forget&#8221; does not mean God suffers amnesia; it means He withdraws covenant favor. Compare <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a> (&#8220;I will forget your children&#8221;) and <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>, where God hides His face when His people break faith.<p>&#8226; The phrase is doubly emphatic in Hebrew (&#8220;forget, forgetting&#8221;) underscoring certainty. God had once pledged never to forget His own (<a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>), yet persistent rebellion forfeits that promise (<a href="/jeremiah/18-15.htm">Jeremiah 18:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and will cast you out of My presence</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and cast you out of My presence&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-39.htm">Jeremiah 23:39</a>b)<p>&#8226; &#8220;My presence&#8221; centers on the temple in Jerusalem, the visible sign of God dwelling among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). Being expelled from that presence means exile&#8212;life outside the land and away from worship.<p>&#8226; The verb recalls Cain driven &#8220;from the face of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>) and Israel removed from God&#8217;s sight in <a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>.

Jerusalem, once a gift (<a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1-3</a>), will share the fate of its inhabitants. <a href="/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14</a> echoes this: God will &#8220;cast out of My sight&#8221; both house (temple) and city.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;gave to you and your fathers&#8221; recalls the Abrahamic promise (<a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-15</a>). Exile reveals how sin endangers even the most cherished covenant blessings (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment came in 586 BC when Babylon razed the city, dismantled the temple, and deported the survivors (<a href="/jeremiah/39-8.htm">Jeremiah 39:8-9</a>). The land gift was never rescinded permanently, but it was withdrawn temporarily as discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/23-39.htm">Jeremiah 23:39</a> declares God&#8217;s decisive response to leaders who shamelessly misrepresent Him.
