In the context of ancient Israel, prophets were often mistrusted or accused of treason, especially when their messages were unpopular. Jeremiah's declaration here is a defense against false accusations, reflecting the broader biblical theme of truth versus falsehood, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, where Satan is described as the father of lies.<p><b>&#8220;I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!&#8221;</b><br>The Chaldeans, also known as the Babylonians, were the dominant power threatening Jerusalem at this time. Jeremiah had been accused of defecting to the enemy, a serious charge during a time of war. Historically, the Chaldeans were known for their military prowess and their eventual conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Jeremiah's denial underscores his loyalty to his people and his role as a true prophet of God, despite the political turmoil and pressure to conform to nationalistic expectations.<p><b>But Irijah would not listen to him;</b><br>Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, was a guard at the Benjamin Gate, a critical location for controlling access to the city. His refusal to listen to Jeremiah reflects the broader rejection of prophetic voices by the leaders and people of Judah, a recurring theme in Jeremiah's ministry. This mirrors the rejection of prophets throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>, where Micaiah is dismissed by King Ahab.<p><b>instead, he arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officials.</b><br>Jeremiah's arrest is indicative of the persecution faced by prophets who spoke God's truth. The officials, likely members of the royal court or military leaders, were often resistant to Jeremiah's messages of impending judgment. This act of arresting a prophet foreshadows the treatment of Jesus Christ, who was also arrested and brought before officials (<a href="/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57</a>), highlighting the pattern of rejection faced by God's messengers. The arrest serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the opposition faced by those who stand for God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

He answers calmly but firmly, like Peter and John who said, &#8220;We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<p>- Jeremiah&#8217;s earlier resolve&#8212;&#8220;His word is in my heart like a burning fire&#8230;I cannot hold it in&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>)&#8212;drives him to speak truth even when threatened.<p>- Faithful witnesses always respond; silence would grant falsehoods power (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!</b><p>- Important nuance: Jeremiah had proclaimed that surrendering when God commanded it would be life-saving (<a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; 38:2). Obedience for the people, however, was not the same as personal treason for the prophet.<p>- Like Elijah accused of being Israel&#8217;s &#8220;troubler&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17-18</a>), Jeremiah faces the charge of betrayal because his message contradicted nationalistic hopes.<p>- His denial underscores integrity: he will deliver God&#8217;s word yet remain loyal to his people&#8212;&#8220;pressed on every side, but not crushed&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Irijah would not listen to him</b><p>- Refusal to listen echoes Judah&#8217;s larger spiritual deafness: &#8220;They did not listen or incline their ear&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-23.htm">Jeremiah 17:23</a>).<p>- Hardened hearts fulfill <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>; they hear the words yet resist the truth.<p>- Stephen experienced the same obstinacy: &#8220;They covered their ears and rushed together at him&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-57.htm">Acts 7:57</a>). Sin&#8217;s stubbornness blinds even to obvious innocence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Instead, he arrested Jeremiah</b><p>- Persecution of God&#8217;s messengers is a repeated pattern: Pashhur had earlier beaten and jailed Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2-3</a>).<p>- Jesus prepared His followers: &#8220;If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p>- Arrest does not signal divine abandonment but participation in the sufferings that precede vindication (<a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And took him to the officials</b><p>- Formal charges in a corrupt court: &#8220;The priests and prophets said to the officials, &#8216;This man deserves the sentence of death&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/26-11.htm">Jeremiah 26:11</a>).<p>- Authorities should protect truth yet often misuse power, as when &#8220;the assembly of elders&#8230; led Him into their council&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-66.htm">Luke 22:66</a>) concerning Jesus.<p>- Paul, too, faced officials in Caesarea (<a href="/acts/24-1.htm">Acts 24:1</a>); faithful servants may stand before earthly rulers but remain accountable to the heavenly King.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/37-14.htm">Jeremiah 37:14</a> portrays a faithful prophet confronting a false accusation, steadfastly declaring truth, yet suffering unjust arrest because hardened hearts refuse God&#8217;s word.

Neither they nor Irijah would listen to the prophet's denial of the accusation. The fact that the siege had been raised by the Chaldaeans may have given fresh strength to the party of resistance.
