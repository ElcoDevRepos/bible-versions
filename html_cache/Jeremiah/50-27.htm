In ancient cultures, bulls often represented strength, fertility, and wealth. The "young bulls" could be seen as the leaders or warriors of Babylon, indicating a complete overthrow of their military might. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God judges nations by dismantling their power structures (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>).<p><b>let them go down to the slaughter.</b><br>The imagery of slaughter conveys the totality of the impending judgment. This phrase suggests a divinely ordained defeat, where the Babylonians are led to their demise as a consequence of their actions. The concept of going "down" may also imply a descent into Sheol, the realm of the dead, which is a common theme in prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18-32</a>).<p><b>Woe to them,</b><br>"Woe" is a term often used by prophets to announce impending doom or divine judgment. It serves as a lament and a warning, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. This expression is frequently found in prophetic books, such as Isaiah and Ezekiel, where it underscores the gravity of turning away from God.<p><b>for their day has come&#8212;</b><br>The "day" refers to the appointed time of judgment. In prophetic literature, the "day of the Lord" is a recurring theme, signifying a time when God intervenes in history to execute justice (e.g., <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1-11</a>). This phrase indicates that the time for Babylon's reckoning has arrived, fulfilling the prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah and other prophets.<p><b>the time of their punishment.</b><br>This phrase confirms that the judgment is a direct consequence of Babylon's sins. The concept of divine retribution is central to the prophetic message, where nations and individuals are held accountable for their actions. This punishment is not arbitrary but is portrayed as a just response to Babylon's idolatry, oppression, and defiance against God. The idea of a set "time" for punishment aligns with the biblical understanding of God's sovereignty and justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire being addressed in this passage, known for its power and oppression of Israel and other nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_bulls.htm">Young Bulls</a></b><br>Symbolic of the strong and mighty men of Babylon, representing the nation's military strength and leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/slaughter.htm">Slaughter</a></b><br>Refers to the impending judgment and destruction that God is pronouncing upon Babylon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message of judgment against Babylon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_punishment.htm">The Day of Punishment</a></b><br>A specific time appointed by God for executing judgment on Babylon for its sins and transgressions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of the rise and fall of nations.

In an agrarian culture young bulls symbolize vigor, abundance, and protection. God is saying that even Babylon&#8217;s strongest defenders will fall. &#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/46-21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21</a> shows a similar metaphor of &#8220;stall-fed calves&#8221; destroyed in Egypt&#8217;s judgment. &#8226; <a href="/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a> speaks of mighty warriors falling like &#8220;wild oxen.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a> uses &#8220;strong bulls&#8221; to describe oppressive enemies. Each cross reference reinforces the idea that no earthly power, however robust, can stand when God decrees judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let them go down to the slaughter</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;let them go down to the slaughter.&#8221; The language is not merely poetic; it foretells literal devastation. Once the sentence is pronounced, Babylon&#8217;s forces are led like animals to an irreversible end. &#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/51-40.htm">Jeremiah 51:40</a> echoes, &#8220;I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/12-3.htm">Jeremiah 12:3</a> speaks of enemies set apart &#8220;for the day of slaughter.&#8221; The repetition across the prophets underlines the certainty&#8212;God&#8217;s justice is thorough and unrelenting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Woe to them</b><p>The cry &#8220;Woe to them&#8221; is both a lament and a verdict. It expresses sorrow for the coming ruin while underscoring Babylon&#8217;s guilt. &#8226; <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a> employ similar &#8220;woe&#8221; statements to condemn nations that flaunt God&#8217;s standards. &#8226; Jesus later echoes this prophetic formula in <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>, pronouncing woes on unrepentant leaders. The pattern shows that divine lament does not negate divine responsibility; Babylon chose rebellion, and the announced woe seals its fate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For their day has come&#8212;the time of their punishment</b><p>The final clause pinpoints timing: &#8220;their day has come&#8212;the time of their punishment.&#8221; Nations may presume long-term dominance, but God sets an appointed &#8220;day&#8221; when hidden iniquity meets open reckoning. &#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/50-31.htm">Jeremiah 50:31-32</a> already warned, &#8220;Your time has come.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a> foretold &#8220;the day of the LORD&#8230; destruction from the Almighty&#8221; against Babylon. &#8226; <a href="/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a> declares, &#8220;her plagues will come in a single day.&#8221; Each passage highlights God&#8217;s sovereign calendar; when the appointed hour arrives, judgment falls swiftly and conclusively.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a> breaks into four linked truths: the overthrow of Babylon&#8217;s strongest, the certainty of their slaughter, the sorrowful yet rightful &#8220;woe,&#8221; and the arrival of their divinely scheduled punishment.
