Historically, this refers to the Medes and Persians, led by Cyrus the Great, who conquered Babylon in 539 BC. The "land of the north" often symbolizes a place of impending judgment in biblical prophecy, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a>. This assembly of nations fulfills earlier prophecies about Babylon's downfall (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17-19</a>). The gathering of nations also prefigures the ultimate judgment against spiritual Babylon in <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17-18</a>.<p><b>They will line up against her; from the north she will be captured.</b><br>The strategic military alignment against Babylon signifies a well-coordinated attack. Historically, the Medo-Persian forces approached from the north, capturing the city with minimal resistance. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1-2</a>, where God promises to open doors before Cyrus. The capture from the north emphasizes the fulfillment of God's word and the certainty of His judgments.<p><b>Their arrows will be like skilled warriors who do not return empty-handed.</b><br>This imagery of arrows and skilled warriors highlights the effectiveness and precision of the invading forces. In ancient warfare, archers were crucial for weakening enemy defenses. The phrase suggests that the attackers will be successful and thorough, leaving no spoils behind. This can be seen as a metaphor for God's judgment being complete and inescapable, similar to the imagery in <a href="/psalms/127-4.htm">Psalm 127:4-5</a>, where arrows represent strength and victory. The prophecy underscores the certainty of Babylon's defeat and the futility of resisting God's ordained plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its wealth and military might, often symbolizing pride and opposition to God in the Bible.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/assembly_of_great_nations.htm">Assembly of Great Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the coalition of nations that God will raise against Babylon, indicating a divinely orchestrated judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_the_north.htm">Land of the North</a></b><br>Typically associated with regions like Media and Persia, which historically conquered Babylon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/skilled_warriors.htm">Skilled Warriors</a></b><br>Symbolizes the effectiveness and precision of the invading forces, emphasizing the certainty of Babylon's downfall.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message of judgment against Babylon, serving as a mouthpiece for divine prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God orchestrates the rise and fall of nations according to His divine plan.

The received reading, however, is self-evidently right. <span class="cmt_word">None shall return in vain.</span> It seems doubtful whether this refers to the arrow or to the mighty man. The arrow may be said to "return [or, 'turn'] in vain" when it misses its aim or strikes the mark without piercing it (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>, where, however, it is the sword which is thus spoken of); the mighty man when he retires from the field defeated. This wider use of the phrase is sanctioned by <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/50-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stir up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
