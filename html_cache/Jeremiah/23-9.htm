In the historical context, prophets were meant to be God's messengers, conveying His will to the people. However, during Jeremiah's time, many prophets were false, leading the people astray with messages that contradicted God's true intentions. This sets the stage for a critique of those who claim to speak for God but do not.<p><b>My heart is broken within me:</b><br>Jeremiah expresses deep emotional distress, indicating the seriousness of the situation. The heart, in Hebrew thought, is the center of emotion and will. Jeremiah's broken heart reflects his sorrow over the false prophets' deception and the resulting spiritual decay of the nation. This phrase also highlights the prophet's empathy and alignment with God's own grief over the people's sin.<p><b>and all my bones tremble:</b><br>The imagery of trembling bones suggests a physical reaction to spiritual and emotional turmoil. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bones were often seen as the seat of strength and vitality. Jeremiah's trembling bones symbolize the profound impact of the false prophets' actions on his entire being, indicating the depth of his concern and fear for the consequences of their deceit.<p><b>I have become like a drunkard, like a man overcome by wine:</b><br>This simile illustrates Jeremiah's disorientation and loss of control, akin to intoxication. The comparison to a drunkard emphasizes the overwhelming nature of the divine message and the prophet's inability to remain unaffected by the gravity of the situation. It also suggests a contrast between the false prophets' self-indulgence and Jeremiah's genuine, albeit overwhelming, response to God's word.<p><b>because of the LORD, because of His holy words:</b><br>The source of Jeremiah's distress is divine in origin. The phrase underscores the authority and sanctity of God's words, which stand in stark contrast to the false messages of the deceitful prophets. The holiness of God's words implies their purity, truth, and power, which deeply affect Jeremiah, driving him to lament the spiritual state of his people. This also points to the prophetic role as a burden, where the true prophet is deeply affected by the weight of God's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is speaking in this verse.

He is not speaking in generalities; he is addressing those who claimed God&#8217;s authority yet spoke lies (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>; 14:14).<p>&#8226; True prophets were to stand in God&#8217;s council and faithfully relay His word (<a href="/jeremiah/23-22.htm">Jeremiah 23:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>). These men had abandoned that calling, echoing the behavior Ezekiel later denounces (<a href="/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus warns about the same danger centuries later: &#8220;Beware of false prophets&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>). The problem Jeremiah laments still stalks the church today whenever charisma outruns submission to Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My heart is broken within me</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah feels what God feels. The rupture of truth among the prophets leaves him crushed, much like he wept over Jerusalem in 9:1.<p>&#8226; The phrase conveys deep sorrow rather than personal offense; the prophet&#8217;s heart mirrors the Lord&#8217;s grief over His people (<a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a> reminds us that the Lord is &#8220;near to the brokenhearted,&#8221; so Jeremiah&#8217;s anguish actually aligns him more closely with God&#8217;s own heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All my bones tremble</b><p>&#8226; The impact of revelation is not merely emotional; it registers physically. Job described a similar reaction when God&#8217;s word touched him (&#8220;a tremble seized all my bones,&#8221; <a href="/job/4-14.htm">Job 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Habakkuk experienced it too: &#8220;my body trembles, my lips quiver&#8230; my legs tremble beneath me&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine encounters with God dismantle self-confidence. Jeremiah&#8217;s shaking contrasts sharply with the swagger of the false prophets, exposing their lack of true encounter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have become like a drunkard, like a man overcome by wine</b><p>&#8226; The prophet is not literally intoxicated. He is overwhelmed&#8212;disoriented by the sheer weight of God&#8217;s word.<p>&#8226; When the Spirit was poured out at Pentecost, onlookers thought the disciples were drunk (<a href="/acts/2-13.htm">Acts 2:13-15</a>). Revelation can look reckless to the unspiritual eye.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a> contrasts drunkenness with being &#8220;filled with the Spirit.&#8221; Jeremiah&#8217;s comparison highlights the consuming power of God&#8217;s revelation, not a loss of moral control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because of the LORD, because of His holy words</b><p>&#8226; The cause of Jeremiah&#8217;s condition is crystal clear: the personal presence of the LORD and the purity of His speech.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word is &#8220;like a fire&#8230; like a hammer that shatters rock&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>). No wonder the prophet feels scorched and shattered.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah had previously confessed, &#8220;Your words were found and I ate them&#8230; they became my joy and my heart&#8217;s delight&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>). Here, those same words overpower him with holy dread.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a> affirms this dynamic for every believer: the word is &#8220;living and active&#8230; able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&#8221; Reverence, not casual familiarity, is the only fitting response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a> captures a faithful prophet&#8217;s visceral reaction to rampant spiritual deception. Confronted with lying leaders, Jeremiah is crushed in spirit, shaken in body, and overwhelmed as though drunk&#8212;yet every sensation is rooted in the LORD and His uncompromising word. The verse reminds us that authentic engagement with Scripture produces humility, reverence, and heartfelt grief over falsehood, calling God&#8217;s people to tremble at His word and reject voices that counterfeit it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Mine heart within me is broken . . .</span>--The abrupt transition shows that we are entering on an entirely new section.

The four clauses describe the varied phenomena of horror and amazement, and then comes the cause of the horror--the contrast between the words of Jehovah and His holiness on the one side, and the wickedness of priests and prophets on the other.
