The imagery of fleeing panic only to fall into a pit suggests that human efforts to escape God's decrees are futile. In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>, Moab is facing judgment for its pride and idolatry. The pit symbolizes a trap or a place of destruction, reminiscent of the consequences of sin as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>, where the wicked fall into the pit they have made.<p><b>and whoever climbs from the pit will be caught in the snare</b><br>The progression from pit to snare emphasizes the certainty and completeness of God's judgment. Even if one escapes one form of calamity, another awaits. This reflects the comprehensive nature of divine justice, as seen in <a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>, where fleeing from a lion leads to encountering a bear. The snare is a common biblical metaphor for unexpected capture or entrapment, often used to describe the fate of those who oppose God.<p><b>For I will bring upon Moab the year of their punishment</b><br>This statement underscores the sovereignty of God in executing judgment. The "year of their punishment" indicates a specific, divinely appointed time for Moab's reckoning. Historically, Moab was a nation east of Israel, often in conflict with God's people. The prophecy against Moab is part of a larger narrative of judgment against the nations surrounding Israel, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15-16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/25-8.htm">Ezekiel 25:8-11</a>. This reflects the biblical theme that God holds all nations accountable, not just Israel.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>The phrase "declares the LORD" affirms the authority and certainty of the prophecy. It is a common prophetic formula that emphasizes the message's divine origin. This declaration assures the reader that the words are not merely human predictions but are spoken by God Himself, ensuring their fulfillment. This is consistent with the prophetic tradition throughout the Old Testament, where God's declarations are irrevocable and certain, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.
