Jeremiah faced significant opposition throughout his ministry, often from those in positions of power. This reflects the broader biblical theme of prophets being rejected by their own people, as seen with other prophets like Elijah and even Jesus Christ (<a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>). The opposition to Jeremiah highlights the spiritual blindness and rebellion of the people of Judah during this period.<p><b>for the law will never be lost to the priest</b><br>This reflects the confidence of the conspirators in the established religious order. Priests were responsible for teaching the law (Torah) and maintaining religious practices. The conspirators believed that the religious system was secure and that Jeremiah's warnings of judgment would not disrupt their status quo. This mirrors the complacency criticized by other prophets, such as in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where people honor God with their lips but their hearts are far from Him.<p><b>nor counsel to the wise</b><br>The "wise" refers to those considered knowledgeable and discerning, often involved in advising leaders. The conspirators' belief that wisdom would remain with them suggests a reliance on human understanding rather than divine revelation. This contrasts with the biblical teaching that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and that human wisdom can be flawed (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p><b>nor an oracle to the prophet</b><br>Prophets were seen as messengers of God, delivering His words to the people. The conspirators' confidence that prophecy would continue as usual indicates their dismissal of Jeremiah's specific messages of impending judgment. This reflects a broader biblical theme where false prophets proclaim peace when there is no peace (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>), contrasting with true prophets who often deliver difficult truths.<p><b>Come, let us denounce him</b><br>The call to denounce Jeremiah shows the active steps taken to discredit him. This is a common tactic against true prophets, as seen with other figures like Daniel and Jesus, who faced false accusations and attempts to undermine their authority (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4</a>, <a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59</a>). It highlights the spiritual battle between truth and deception.<p><b>and pay no heed to any of his words.&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase underscores the people's refusal to listen to Jeremiah's warnings. It reflects a hardened heart and a rejection of God's message, a recurring issue in Israel's history (<a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11-12</a>). This rejection of prophetic words is a precursor to the judgment that eventually comes upon Judah, illustrating the consequences of ignoring God's warnings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Confident that priests, sages, and preferred prophets will keep religion humming, they plot to discredit the lone voice calling for repentance. Their scheme displays a timeless pattern: institutions cannot save when hearts reject God; human wisdom collapses when it sidelines revelation; and denouncing the messenger never cancels the message. The verse therefore warns every generation to prize God&#8217;s unfiltered word above tradition, popularity, or self-made security&#8212;and to stand with His faithful servants even when the crowd conspires otherwise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Come, and let us devise devices.</span>--The priests and people thus far appear to have listened to the prophet, but at the threatening words of the preceding verse their anger becomes hatred, and their hatred seeks to kill (<a href="/jeremiah/18-23.htm" title="Yet, LORD, you know all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from your sight, but let them be overthrown before you; deal thus with them in the time of your anger.">Jeremiah 18:23</a>). We are reminded of the oft-recurring statement in the Gospels that priests and elders "took counsel" against our Lord to "put Him to death" (<a href="/matthew/12-14.htm" title="Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.">Matthew 12:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-1.htm" title="When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:">Matthew 27:1</a>; <a href="/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>; <a href="/luke/6-11.htm" title="And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.">Luke 6:11</a>; <span class= "ital">et al</span>.)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">For the law shall not perish . . .</span>--The words meant apparently (1) that they had enough guidance in the Law, in the priests, and in the prophets who met their wishes, and (2) that they might trust in the continuance of that guidance in spite of the threatenings of destruction that the prophet had just spoken. The words are suggestive as showing the precise nature of the guidance expected from each. The priests interpret the Law, the wise give the counsel of experience, the prophet speaks what claims to be the word, or message, of the Lord. A striking parallel is found in <a href="/ezekiel/7-26.htm" title="Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.">Ezekiel 7:26</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-23.</span> - A fresh conspiracy (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/11-18.htm">Jeremiah 11:18</a>), called forth by the preceding discourse; Jeremiah's prayer. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The law</span> - or rather, <span class="accented">direction</span>, instruction, which was a special function of the priests (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9-11</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">shall not perish from the priest</span>. The Jews were but obeying the Deuteronomic Law (on which Jeremiah, as we have seen, laid so much stress) in alluding to the priests. Unhappily, the priests in Jeremiah's time (<a href="/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>), as in Isaiah's (<a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>), were forgetful of their high mission. <span class="cmt_word">Nor counsel from the wise</span>. The wise men formed an important order in Jewish society, the importance of which in the Divine education of Israel has not been sufficiently recognized. It was their custom to sit in public places, generally in the chambered recess in the city gate, and give advice on questions of moral practice to those who applied for it. But there were wise men and wise men. Some appear, to have "mocked" at the earnest preaching of the prophets (hence the solemn rebukes in the Book of Proverbs), others to have as it were prepared the way for the latter by a more or less distinct recognition of the religious foundation of morality, and of these we have ample monuments in the canonical Proverbs. There may also have been other shades and varieties of wise men, for their characteristic was not a faculty of intuition, but rather of reflectively applying fundamental moral principles. One highly esteemed branch of "wisdom" would, of course, be political, and this would be the most liable to perversion. It is of such (Proverbs 29:14). <span class="cmt_word">Nor the word from the prophet</span>. "The word" is a general term for prophesying. Of course, the speakers take no account of the advance in prophecy from the time, at any rate, of Amos. They are satisfied with the lower order of prophets ("false prophets," as the Septuagint calls them); but still they are afraid of Jeremiah, much as Balak was afraid of Balaam, when that soothsayer was blessing Israel (<a href="/numbers/23-25.htm">Numbers 23:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Smite him with the tongue; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by slanderous accusations</span>.
