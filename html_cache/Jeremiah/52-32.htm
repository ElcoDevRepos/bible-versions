The act of speaking kindly indicates a shift from the harsh treatment Jehoiachin had previously experienced. In the ancient Near East, a king's words held significant power, and speaking kindly would have been a sign of grace and favor. This kindness can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to preserve a remnant of David's line, as Jehoiachin was a descendant of David. It also reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s mercy and the hope of restoration even in exile.<p><b>and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon</b><br>This phrase highlights the elevation of Jehoiachin's status among the other captive kings in Babylon. In the context of the Babylonian empire, it was common for conquered kings to be kept in the court as a sign of the empire's dominance. By setting Jehoiachin's throne above the others, Evil-merodach was not only showing him personal favor but also acknowledging his unique status. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jehoiachin, a king in exile, is exalted, prefiguring Christ's exaltation after His suffering. It also connects to the biblical theme of God lifting the humble and fulfilling His covenant promises, as Jehoiachin's line would eventually lead to the birth of Jesus Christ, the ultimate King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>The former king of Judah who was taken captive by the Babylonians.

Elevating Jehoiachin keeps that lineage alive and prepares for Messiah.<p>&#8226; Personal application: past failure does not cancel future usefulness when God decides to restore (<a href="/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set his throne above</b><p>&#8226; Evil-merodach promoted Jehoiachin to a seat of honor&#8212;an event Scripture treats as historical fact, not metaphor. The captive literally exchanged prison clothes for royal garments (<a href="/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a>).<p>&#8226; God often lifts the humbled: &#8220;He raises the poor from the dust&#8230; to seat them with princes&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7-8</a>).

Jehoiachin&#8217;s elevation demonstrates that obedience in exile does not go unnoticed by God.<p>&#8226; The event served as a quiet reassurance that the exile would not be the final chapter; seventy years later, many would return (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/52-32.htm">Jeremiah 52:32</a> records a literal, historical moment in which God moved a pagan king to treat Jehoiachin kindly, elevate him above other captive rulers, and preserve the Davidic line inside Babylon. Each phrase highlights divine faithfulness: gracious speech shows God&#8217;s compassion; favor to Jehoiachin confirms covenant promises; a higher throne underscores Judah&#8217;s unique calling; and the Babylonian context proves that no place is beyond God&#8217;s reach. The verse therefore stands as a beacon of hope&#8212;assuring believers that the Lord keeps His word, restores the humbled, and advances His redemptive plan even in the darkest settings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/52-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He spoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
