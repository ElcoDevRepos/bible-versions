Throughout the Old Testament, God repeatedly sent prophets to guide His people, but they often ignored His messages (<a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4</a>). This refusal to listen is a recurring theme, illustrating the spiritual stubbornness of Israel. The phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's word, a principle emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's adherence to God's commands.<p><b>or incline their ear</b><br>The imagery of inclining the ear suggests a deliberate act of attentiveness and willingness to understand. In the ancient Near Eastern context, listening was not just hearing words but also acting upon them. <a href="/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a> uses similar language to describe the pursuit of wisdom. The Israelites' failure to incline their ear signifies a deeper spiritual apathy and resistance to divine instruction.<p><b>but they stiffened their necks</b><br>This metaphor of a stiff neck is often used in the Bible to describe obstinacy and rebellion against God (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>). In an agrarian society, a stiff-necked animal would resist the guidance of its master, symbolizing Israel's refusal to submit to God's authority. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of human rebellion, beginning with Adam and Eve's disobedience in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>and did more evil than their fathers</b><br>This statement indicates a generational decline in faithfulness and morality. The comparison to their fathers suggests a worsening condition, as each generation strayed further from God's covenant. This pattern of increasing sinfulness is seen throughout the history of Israel, leading to the eventual exile. It serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God, as seen in the cycles of sin and redemption in the Book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
