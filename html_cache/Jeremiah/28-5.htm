His role as a prophet was to communicate God's words to the people, often facing opposition and persecution. This phrase indicates a direct response, highlighting the importance of addressing false prophecy and maintaining the integrity of God's message.<p><b>to the prophet Hananiah</b><br>Hananiah is identified as a prophet, but his message contradicts that of Jeremiah. In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/28.htm">Jeremiah 28</a>, Hananiah falsely prophesies that the Babylonian yoke will be broken and the exiles will return within two years. This sets up a confrontation between true and false prophecy, a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing the need for discernment and faithfulness to God's true word.<p><b>in the presence of the priests and all the people</b><br>The setting is public, involving religious leaders and the general populace. This public confrontation underscores the gravity of the situation, as the priests and people are witnesses to the prophetic exchange. It reflects the communal nature of worship and decision-making in ancient Israel, where religious and social matters were deeply intertwined.<p><b>who were standing in the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. This location is significant as it represents God's dwelling place among His people. The temple setting adds weight to the prophetic exchange, as it occurs in a sacred space dedicated to the worship and service of God. The presence of the people in the temple also indicates a time of worship or a religious gathering, making the confrontation even more impactful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Hananiah has just pronounced a quick end to Babylonian domination (<a href="/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1-4</a>). &#8220;Then&#8221; signals that what Jeremiah is about to say is a direct response, not a delayed reaction. Scripture often uses such timing words to show God&#8217;s servants stepping in at precisely the right moment (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>). The verse therefore reminds us that God orchestrates events so truth can counter error without hesitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the prophet Jeremiah replied</b><p>Jeremiah&#8217;s role is unmistakable: he speaks for the LORD (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-10</a>). In replying, he fulfills his calling to &#8220;uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>). His answer models faithful obedience:<p>&#8226; He does not remain silent in the face of false prophecy (compare <a href="/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; He does not rely on personal opinion but on the message God previously gave him (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12-15</a>).<p>&#8226; He shows that true prophetic ministry includes correction and warning, not merely comfort (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the prophet Hananiah</b><p>The confrontation is prophet-to-prophet. Hananiah has claimed divine authority but speaks deceit (<a href="/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15</a>). Scripture often sets true and false voices side by side so God&#8217;s people can discern (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>). Jeremiah&#8217;s direct address underlines that spiritual error must be identified, named, and answered, not merely ignored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the presence of the priests</b><p>The priests, responsible for temple worship and instruction (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>), stand as official witnesses. Their presence stresses accountability. If they tolerate false prophecy, the spiritual life of the nation suffers (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7-8</a>). Jeremiah&#8217;s public reply urges the priesthood to uphold God&#8217;s truth (<a href="/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the people</b><p>The entire assembly hears both claims. Public error requires public correction so the community is protected (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a>). God wants His people informed, not manipulated (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). The scene also foreshadows Christ teaching openly in the temple courts where everyone could weigh His words (<a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who were standing in the house of the LORD</b><p>The confrontation takes place in the very location dedicated to God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). Spiritual deception occurring in sacred space intensifies the offense (<a href="/jeremiah/7-1.htm">Jeremiah 7:1-11</a>). Yet it also provides a platform for truth to shine brightest. By standing there, the people are positioned to hear and decide whom they will believe, echoing Elijah&#8217;s call on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/28-5.htm">Jeremiah 28:5</a> portrays a timely, courageous response by God&#8217;s true prophet. In God&#8217;s house and before leaders and laity alike, Jeremiah immediately counters Hananiah&#8217;s false optimism. The verse highlights divine timing, prophetic responsibility, public accountability, and the critical need to confront error where it emerges. It invites every generation to listen carefully, test every claim against God&#8217;s revealed word, and stand boldly for truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> - Jeremiah's reply. He heartily wishes that Hananiah's prediction were capable of fulfillment, but it runs directly counter to the declarations of all the older prophets. "War, and evil, and pestilence" was their constant burden, for the people to whom they prophesied were unworthy of the golden age of felicity in which the prophets so firmly believed. Only by a terrible judgment could the people of Israel be purified for the Messianic age. This appears to be what Jeremiah means by ver. 8. True, he speaks of "countries" and "kingdoms" in the plural, but all the great prophets include the nations best known to them within the range of their preaching, and even of their Messianic preaching. Isaiah, for instance, threatens sore judgment upon Egypt and Assyria, and yet he holds out the cheering prospect that Egypt and Assyria will have a part in the Messianic felicity. Thus Hananiah's prediction has probabilities very strongly against it He not only prophesies "peace,' but attaches no condition to his promise, which, therefore, has double need of verification by the event (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/28-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the prophet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
