In the ancient Near East, diseases were often seen as divine punishment. The context of Jeremiah's prophecy is a time of impending disaster, as Babylonian forces threaten Judah. The diseases could be literal plagues or symbolic of the spiritual decay and corruption among the people. This judgment echoes the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-21.htm">Deuteronomy 28:21-22</a>, where God warns of pestilence as a consequence of covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>They will not be mourned or buried,</b><br>In ancient Israelite culture, proper burial and mourning were essential for honoring the dead. The absence of mourning and burial signifies utter disgrace and divine judgment. This lack of burial rites is a profound dishonor, reflecting the severity of God's wrath. It also indicates the chaos and destruction that will befall the land, leaving no one to perform these essential cultural and religious duties. This imagery is reminiscent of the curses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, where unburied bodies are a sign of God's judgment.<p><b>but will lie like dung on the ground.</b><br>This simile emphasizes the contempt and worthlessness attributed to the unburied bodies. Dung, being waste, is something to be discarded and avoided, highlighting the complete desolation and rejection of the people. This imagery serves to underscore the severity of the judgment and the extent of the people's fall from grace. It also reflects the prophetic tradition of using vivid imagery to convey the seriousness of sin and its consequences.<p><b>They will be finished off by sword and famine,</b><br>The sword and famine are common instruments of divine judgment in the prophetic literature. The sword represents warfare and violence, while famine signifies scarcity and suffering. Together, they depict a comprehensive destruction that leaves no escape for the people. This dual threat is a recurring theme in Jeremiah and other prophetic books, such as <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>, where God uses these elements to execute judgment on a rebellious nation.<p><b>and their corpses will become food for the birds of the air and beasts of the earth.</b><br>This phrase completes the picture of total devastation and disgrace. In the ancient world, being left unburied and consumed by animals was a fate reserved for the most cursed individuals. It signifies a complete reversal of the natural order and divine blessing, where humans, made in God's image, are reduced to mere carrion. This imagery is also found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a> and is echoed in <a href="/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>, where the defeat of God's enemies results in their bodies being consumed by birds, symbolizing ultimate defeat and divine retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

Pestilence, lack of mourning, denial of burial, exposure like dung, destruction by sword and famine, and scavengers consuming the dead form a cascading series of calamities. Each clause ties directly to earlier covenant warnings, demonstrating that God keeps His word both in blessing and in judgment. The verse stands as a stark reminder that persistent rebellion brings devastating consequences, while also affirming the absolute reliability of Scripture&#8217;s warnings and promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Of grievous deaths.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">deaths from diseases, </span>including, perhaps, famine (as in <a href="/jeremiah/14-18.htm" title="If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yes, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.">Jeremiah 14:18</a>), as contrasted with the more immediate work of the sword.<p><span class= "bld">They shall not be lamented.</span>--Among a people who attached such importance to the due observance of funeral obsequies as the Jews did, the neglect of those obsequies was, of course, here, as in <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18</a>, a symptom of extremest misery.
