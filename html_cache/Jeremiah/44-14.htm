This remnant had fled to Egypt for refuge, despite God's warnings through Jeremiah not to do so. The concept of a remnant is significant throughout the Bible, often symbolizing God's preservation of a faithful group despite widespread judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>).<p><b>who have gone to reside in Egypt</b><br>Egypt was a place of refuge for many nations during times of crisis due to its relative stability and resources. However, for the Israelites, Egypt symbolized a return to bondage and disobedience, as it was the land from which God had delivered them during the Exodus. This act of fleeing to Egypt was seen as a lack of faith in God's promises and protection.<p><b>will escape or survive</b><br>The prophecy indicates that those who fled to Egypt would not find safety or deliverance there. This aligns with God's consistent message through Jeremiah that disobedience would lead to judgment. The terms "escape" and "survive" emphasize the totality of the impending disaster, leaving no room for misunderstanding the severity of the consequences.<p><b>to return to the land of Judah</b><br>The land of Judah was the promised land, a place of covenantal significance for the Israelites. Their desire to return highlights their longing for restoration and normalcy. However, their actions contradicted this desire, as they sought security in Egypt rather than trusting in God's plan for their return.<p><b>where they long to return and live</b><br>This phrase underscores the deep-seated yearning of the Jewish people to be in their homeland, a place tied to their identity and God's promises. Despite their physical presence in Egypt, their hearts remained in Judah, reflecting the tension between their desires and their actions.<p><b>for none will return except a few fugitives.&#8221;</b><br>The prophecy concludes with a glimmer of hope, as "a few fugitives" would return. This remnant within the remnant signifies God's mercy and the continuation of His covenant promises. It also foreshadows the eventual return from exile, as seen in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, where a small group of Jews did indeed return to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/remnant_of_judah.htm">Remnant of Judah</a></b><br>The remaining people of Judah who survived the Babylonian conquest and subsequently fled to Egypt against God's command.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_egypt.htm">Land of Egypt</a></b><br>A place of refuge for the remnant of Judah, despite God's warnings through Jeremiah not to go there.
