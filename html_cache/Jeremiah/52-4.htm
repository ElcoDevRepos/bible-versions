His reign was marked by political instability and rebellion against Babylonian rule. The ninth year of his reign corresponds to 588 BC, a critical period in Judah's history as it faced the consequences of its disobedience to God.<p><b>on the tenth day of the tenth month</b><br>This specific date is significant in the Jewish calendar, marking the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem. It is remembered in Jewish tradition as a day of mourning, reflecting the gravity of the events that unfolded. The precision of the date underscores the historical accuracy and importance of the event.<p><b>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was one of the most powerful monarchs of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, known for his military conquests and the expansion of his empire. His role in the siege of Jerusalem fulfills the prophecies of Jeremiah and other prophets who warned of Babylon's rise as an instrument of God's judgment against Judah.<p><b>marched against Jerusalem with his entire army</b><br>The mobilization of Nebuchadnezzar's entire army indicates the seriousness of the campaign against Jerusalem. This military action was not just a punitive expedition but a decisive move to subdue and control the rebellious city, reflecting the geopolitical strategies of ancient empires.<p><b>They encamped outside the city</b><br>The encampment of the Babylonian army outside Jerusalem signifies the beginning of a prolonged siege. This tactic was common in ancient warfare, aiming to cut off supplies and weaken the city's defenses over time. The siege would last for approximately 18 months, leading to severe famine and hardship within Jerusalem.<p><b>and built a siege wall all around it</b><br>The construction of a siege wall, or rampart, was a strategic move to isolate Jerusalem completely. This wall prevented any escape or entry, effectively sealing the city's fate. The siege wall is a testament to the military engineering skills of the Babylonians and highlights the dire situation faced by the inhabitants of Jerusalem. This event fulfills the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who foretold the destruction due to the people's unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, appointed by Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned during the final siege of Jerusalem.
