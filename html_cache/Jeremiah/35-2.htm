They were known for their strict adherence to a lifestyle of abstinence from wine, living in tents, and avoiding permanent settlements, as commanded by their ancestor Jonadab. This command was a reaction against the Canaanite influence and idolatry, promoting a lifestyle of simplicity and devotion to God. The Rechabites serve as a model of faithfulness and obedience, contrasting with the disobedience of Judah.<p><b>speak to them</b><br>Jeremiah is instructed to engage directly with the Rechabites, highlighting the importance of personal communication in prophetic ministry. This direct approach underscores the relational aspect of God's dealings with His people, emphasizing the need for clear and personal communication of His will.<p><b>and bring them to one of the chambers of the house of the LORD</b><br>The chambers in the temple were used for various purposes, including storage and as meeting places for priests and Levites. Bringing the Rechabites to the temple signifies a formal and solemn setting, underscoring the seriousness of the test that Jeremiah is about to present. It also highlights the temple as a place of divine encounter and revelation.<p><b>to offer them a drink of wine</b><br>This action serves as a test of the Rechabites' commitment to their ancestral vow. Wine, often associated with joy and celebration in the Bible, here becomes a symbol of temptation and potential compromise. The Rechabites' refusal to drink wine, as recorded later in the chapter, serves as a powerful testimony to their faithfulness and integrity. This incident foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on spiritual sobriety and self-control (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Among those who had thus taken refuge were the tribe, or sect, or even fraternity known by this name. Their founder was the Jonadab, or Jehonadab, who appears as the ally of Jehu in the overthrow of the house of Ahab (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.">2Kings 10:15</a>). It is clear from that history that he exercised an influence over the people which Jehu was glad to secure, and that he welcomed "the zeal for the Lord" which led Jehu to the massacre of the worshippers of Baal. He is described as the "son of Rechab," but seeing that that name, which means "chariot," was applied to the great Tishbite prophet, as in "the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof" (<a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm" title="And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.">2Kings 2:12</a>), it has been thought, with some probability, that the name "son of Rechab" means "Son of the chariot" (so in later Jewish history we have Bar-cochba = son of the star), <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "disciple of the great prophet." Anyhow, the life which Jonadab enforced on his followers presented all the characteristic features of that of Elijah. It was a protest against the Baal-worship that had flowed into Israel from Phoenicia, against the corruption of the life of cities, against the intemperance which was tainting the life of Israel (<a href="/context/amos/6-4.htm" title="That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;">Amos 6:4-6</a>). It reminds us in this respect of the more ascetic sects, such as the Wahabees of Arabia in the eighteenth century (see Burckhardt's <span class= "ital">Bedouins and Wahabys, </span>p. 283; Palgrave's <span class= "ital">Arabia</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>that have at times arisen among the followers of Mahomet.

These are the Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab.">1Chronicles 2:55</a> it appears that "the house of Rechab" belonged to the Kenites who had joined the Israelites on their exodus from Egypt, and had settled in their lands, retaining their old habits (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="/judges/4-11.htm" title="Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.">Judges 4:11</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/10-29.htm" title="And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come you with us, and we will do you good: for the LORD has spoken good concerning Israel.">Numbers 10:29-32</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-6.htm" title="And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.

And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.">1Samuel 27:10</a>). Such a people naturally retained many of the habits of patriarchal life, and it is not improbable that Elijah himself issued from their tents.<span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of the Rechabites</span> ("house" equivalent to "family"). From a notice in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a> it appears that the Rechabites were a subdivision of the Kenites, the nomad tribe so closely connected with the Israelites (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="/judges/4-18.htm">Judges 4:18-22</a>; comp. <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a>), especially with the tribe of Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>). The names of Jonadab and of Jaazaniah and his progenitors (which include the sacred Name), together with the zeal of Jonadab for the worship of Jehovah (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15, 23</a>), seem to indicate that the religion of the Rechabites approximated closely to that of the Israelites. There seem, in fact, to have been two branches of the Kenites - one having Edomitish, the other Israelitish, affinities. Records of the former still exist in the Sinaitic inscriptions, and in the Arabian histories; indeed, there is still a tribe called Benu-l-Qain (often contracted into Belqein) in the Belqa (the ancient land of Ammon); and it would seem that there is an Arab tribe in Arabia Petraea, eastward of Kerak, which traces itself to Heber the Kenite. and goes by the name of Yehud Chebr, though it now denies any connection with Jews. There were also Jews of Khaibar, near Mecca, who played an important part in the early history of Islam (see further 'Zeitschr. der deutschen morgenland. Gesellschaft,' 8:706; 14:438; 28:568, 571). <span class="cmt_word">Into one of the chambers.</span> There were many "chambers" of different sizes attached to the temple, and employed partly for stores, partly for councils and assemblies, partly for guard chambers, and other official purposes (comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a>). In <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a> we even find a private person occupying one of the "chambers." That into which Jeremiah conducted the Rechabites was, no doubt, one of the largest size; it was appropriated to the use of a single priestly family - the "sons of Hanan" (ver. 4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Rechabites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1499;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
