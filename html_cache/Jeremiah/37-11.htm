Their withdrawal from Jerusalem was a temporary strategic move rather than a permanent retreat. This event occurred during the reign of King Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, who was placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. The withdrawal provided a brief respite for Jerusalem, but it was not a sign of deliverance. Historically, the Babylonians were known for their military prowess and their ability to lay siege to cities, which they would later do successfully to Jerusalem in 586 BC. This momentary withdrawal was part of the larger geopolitical struggles of the time, as Babylon sought to consolidate its power over the region.<p><b>for fear of Pharaoh&#8217;s army</b><br>Pharaoh's army refers to the Egyptian forces under Pharaoh Hophra (also known as Apries), who reigned from 589 to 570 BC. Egypt was a significant power in the region and often involved in the affairs of Judah and its neighbors. The fear of Pharaoh's army indicates the complex political alliances and enmities of the time. Judah, under Zedekiah, had sought an alliance with Egypt in hopes of resisting Babylonian domination. This alliance was contrary to the warnings of the prophet Jeremiah, who had consistently advised against relying on Egypt for help, urging instead submission to Babylon as God's ordained instrument of judgment. The temporary withdrawal of the Chaldeans due to the Egyptian threat was a false hope for Judah, as Jeremiah had prophesied that Egypt would not ultimately save them (<a href="/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7-10</a>).
