In the context of ancient warfare, archers were crucial for long-range attacks. The bow is often symbolic of military strength and power (<a href="/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>). The command suggests a divine intervention where God is orchestrating the downfall of Babylon, preventing them from defending themselves effectively. This reflects God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other prophetic judgments (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17-19</a>).<p><b>or put on his armor</b><br>Armor represents protection and readiness for battle. By instructing that the enemy should not put on armor, the text emphasizes the futility of human efforts against divine judgment. This mirrors the biblical theme that human strength is insufficient without God's favor (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). The imagery of unarmored soldiers highlights the vulnerability of Babylon, a once-mighty empire, now subject to God's wrath.<p><b>Do not spare her young men</b><br>The young men symbolize the strength and future of a nation. In ancient cultures, they were the primary warriors and the hope for continuity. The command not to spare them underscores the totality of the judgment against Babylon. This is consistent with other biblical instances where God's judgment is thorough and complete (<a href="/isaiah/13-15.htm">Isaiah 13:15-18</a>). It reflects the seriousness of Babylon's sins and the irrevocable nature of divine justice.<p><b>devote all her army to destruction!</b><br>The phrase "devote to destruction" is reminiscent of the Hebrew concept of "herem," where something is completely given over to God, often through destruction (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). This indicates that Babylon's army is to be entirely annihilated as an offering to God's justice. It signifies the complete and utter defeat of Babylon, fulfilling the prophecies of its downfall (<a href="/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21-32</a>). This destruction serves as a type of final judgment, prefiguring the ultimate defeat of evil in eschatological terms (<a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and other nations, including Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire during Jeremiah's time, Babylon is often depicted as an instrument of God's judgment but also as a recipient of divine wrath due to its pride and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_archer.htm">The Archer</a></b><br>Represents the military might of Babylon, which God is instructing to be rendered ineffective in this prophecy of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_men.htm">Young Men</a></b><br>Symbolic of the strength and future of Babylon, indicating that even the most promising and vigorous will not be spared from God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_army.htm">The Army</a></b><br>Refers to the collective military forces of Babylon, which are destined for destruction as part of God's divine retribution.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and their destinies.

The difficulty, however, is in the first two words of the clause, which are the same in either reading. It would be much simpler to alter a single point, and render, "Let not the archer bend his bow; and let him not lift himself up in his coat of mail" (for the old word "brigandine," see on Jeremiah 46:4); which might be explained of the Babylonians, on the analogy of <a href="/jeremiah/46-6.htm">Jeremiah 46:6</a>, "Let him not bend his bow, for it will be useless;" but then the second half of the verse hardly suits the first - the prohibitions seem clearly intended to run on in a connected order. On the other hand, the descriptions, "him that bendeth," and "him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine," seem hardly a natural way of putting "the Chaldean army." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/51-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not let the archer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1444;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7695;&#183;r&#333;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1869.htm">Strong's 1869: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tread, to walk, to string a, bow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bend</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#333;&#183;r&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
