In the context of Jeremiah, the Israelites are experiencing severe drought and calamity, leading them to question God's presence and power. This rhetorical question highlights their desperation and confusion, as they expect God to act decisively on their behalf. The imagery of God being "taken by surprise" contrasts with His omniscience and omnipotence, emphasizing the depth of their crisis and their struggle to understand His ways.<p><b>like a warrior powerless to save?</b><br>The comparison to a warrior suggests expectations of divine intervention and deliverance, as God is often depicted as a mighty warrior in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). The Israelites are bewildered by the perceived absence of God's saving power, which they have historically relied upon. This reflects a crisis of faith, as they grapple with the tension between their understanding of God's nature and their current reality. The imagery underscores the severity of their plight and their longing for God's intervention.<p><b>Yet You are among us, O LORD</b><br>Despite their doubts and fears, the Israelites acknowledge God's presence among them. This statement is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He promised to dwell among them (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45-46</a>). It reflects a deep-seated belief in God's faithfulness and His commitment to His people, even when circumstances seem dire. This acknowledgment serves as a reminder of God's enduring presence, offering hope amidst their despair.<p><b>and we are called by Your name</b><br>Being called by God's name signifies a special relationship and identity as His chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>). This phrase emphasizes the covenantal bond and the responsibilities that come with it. It also implies a plea for God to act in accordance with His promises, as His reputation is intertwined with the fate of His people. The Israelites appeal to their identity as God's people, seeking His intervention based on their covenantal relationship.<p><b>Do not forsake us!</b><br>This urgent plea reflects the fear of abandonment and the desire for divine mercy. The Israelites are aware of their sins and the consequences they face, yet they appeal to God's compassion and faithfulness. This cry echoes throughout the Psalms and other prophetic writings, where God's people seek His forgiveness and restoration (e.g., <a href="/psalms/71-9.htm">Psalm 71:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>). It underscores the hope that, despite their unfaithfulness, God will remain true to His character and promises, offering redemption and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing drought and divine judgment during Jeremiah's ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is being implored by Jeremiah not to forsake His people despite their sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/drought.htm">Drought</a></b><br>A significant event during this time, symbolizing God's judgment and the people's need for repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>Those who are called by God's name, yet are experiencing the consequences of their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_amidst_trials.htm">God's Presence Amidst Trials</a></b><br>Even when circumstances seem dire, God is among His people.

It feels as though the Lord has shown up late and bewildered. Job voiced the same confusion (<a href="/job/30-20.htm">Job 30:20</a>), and the psalmist lamented, &#8220;Awake, O Lord! Why do You sleep?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23&#8211;24</a>). In the Gospels the disciples echoed it when the storm raged and Jesus slept (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>). Scripture speaks honestly about how trials can make God&#8217;s timing seem puzzling, yet never questions His sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a warrior powerless to save</b><p>The image sharpens: a mighty soldier who suddenly cannot swing his sword. The people know Yahweh is the &#8220;LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>), the One who &#8220;will fight for you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>), but their circumstances tempt them to doubt. Elijah faced the same tension on Mount Carmel&#8212;either the Lord answers with fire or He does not (<a href="/1_kings/18-37.htm">1 Kings 18:37&#8211;39</a>). The Bible never paints God as actually weak; it records human perception when faith collides with hardship.<p>&#8226; Scripture answers this fear with repeated assurance: &#8220;Is the Lord&#8217;s arm too short?&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-23.htm">Numbers 11:23</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Salvation belongs to the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>) stands as an unmovable declaration.<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s resurrection ultimately proves that no enemy, not even death, can stop His saving power (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54&#8211;57</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yet You are among us, O LORD</b><p>Faith pushes past feelings to confess fact: God is present. He promised, &#8220;I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45&#8211;46</a>), and He never withdrew that covenant presence. Centuries later Jesus, called Immanuel&#8212;&#8220;God with us&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>)&#8212;walked among His people, confirming that Jeremiah&#8217;s confession was literally true. Even when discipline comes, the Lord remains &#8220;near to all who call on Him in truth&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And we are called by Your name</b><p>Identity becomes the next anchor. Being &#8220;called by Your name&#8221; means belonging to Him, much like a family bearing the father&#8217;s surname. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a> foresaw nations recognizing Israel as &#8220;called by the name of the LORD.&#8221; The early church embraced the same reality, so James could cite <a href="/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>&#8212;Gentiles too are &#8220;called by My name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-17.htm">Acts 15:17</a>). Our standing rests not on merit but on His covenant claim.<p>&#8226; This title carries privilege (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>) and responsibility (<a href="/micah/4-5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; It assures access: &#8220;Since we have a great high priest&#8230;let us draw near&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; It guarantees protection: &#8220;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not forsake us!</b><p>The plea concludes with confidence in God&#8217;s unbreakable promise. He had already said, &#8220;I will never leave you nor forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>), a promise echoed to believers today (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>). The psalmist testifies, &#8220;For the LORD will not forsake His people&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a>). Jeremiah teaches us to pray boldly, appealing to God&#8217;s character rather than our performance, trusting that even discipline is administered by a faithful Father (<a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a> captures raw human bewilderment when God seems absent, yet it steers the heart back to truth. Though circumstances may suggest He is surprised or powerless, Scripture affirms He is ever-present, mighty to save, and faithful to those who bear His name. The verse invites us to acknowledge our honest fears, anchor ourselves in God&#8217;s covenant presence, and plead His unfailing promise: He will not forsake His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">As a man astonied.</span>--The word so rendered is not found elsewhere, but cognate words in Arabic have the meaning of being startled and perplexed.<p><span class= "bld">Thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us.</span>--After all, then, so the prophet's reviving faith tells him, Jehovah is more than the passing guest.
