This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the message, underscoring the authority and authenticity of the prophecy. The phrase "word of the LORD" is a common biblical expression indicating a revelation from God, which is a central theme in the prophetic books. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to convey God's messages to the people of Judah, often calling them to repentance and warning of impending judgment.<p><b>when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was the powerful ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, reigning from 605 to 562 BC. He is a significant historical figure known for his military conquests and the expansion of Babylonian influence. His campaigns against Jerusalem are well-documented in both biblical and extra-biblical sources. Nebuchadnezzar's role in the biblical narrative is as an instrument of God's judgment against Judah for their disobedience and idolatry, fulfilling the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah.<p><b>all his army</b><br>The mention of Nebuchadnezzar's army highlights the formidable military force that besieged Jerusalem. The Babylonian army was known for its strength and strategic prowess, which played a crucial role in the eventual fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. This military might is a reminder of the seriousness of the threat faced by Judah and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about the consequences of their unfaithfulness to God.<p><b>all the earthly kingdoms under his control</b><br>This phrase indicates the vastness of Nebuchadnezzar's empire, which included many vassal states and conquered territories. The Babylonian Empire was one of the most powerful empires of the ancient Near East, and its influence extended over a large geographical area. This dominance is a testament to the fulfillment of God's plan, as He used Babylon as a tool to execute judgment on the nations, including Judah.<p><b>and all the other nations</b><br>The inclusion of "all the other nations" suggests a coalition of forces or the widespread impact of Babylon's military campaigns. This reflects the historical reality of ancient Near Eastern politics, where empires often formed alliances with other nations to strengthen their military endeavors. It also underscores the comprehensive nature of the threat against Jerusalem, as it was not only Babylon but a multitude of nations that were involved in the siege.<p><b>were fighting against Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was the spiritual and political center of the Jewish people. The siege of Jerusalem was a pivotal event in biblical history, leading to the destruction of the city and the temple, and the exile of the Jewish people. This event was prophesied by Jeremiah and other prophets as a consequence of the nation's persistent sin and rebellion against God. The fall of Jerusalem marked a significant turning point in the history of Israel and Judah.<p><b>and all its surrounding cities</b><br>The mention of "all its surrounding cities" indicates that the Babylonian campaign was not limited to Jerusalem alone but affected the entire region of Judah. This widespread devastation fulfilled the prophecies of judgment pronounced by Jeremiah and others, highlighting the totality of the destruction and the severity of God's discipline. The surrounding cities, which were part of the kingdom of Judah, also faced the consequences of the nation's collective disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
