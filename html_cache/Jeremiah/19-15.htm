The title "LORD of Hosts" signifies God's command over the armies of heaven, indicating His supreme power. The "God of Israel" highlights His covenant relationship with the nation of Israel, reminding them of their unique position and responsibilities. This introduction underscores that the message is not from Jeremiah himself but from God, lending it divine authority.<p><b>Behold, I am about to bring on this city and on all the villages around it every disaster I have pronounced against them:</b><br>The term "Behold" serves as a call to attention, indicating the seriousness of the forthcoming message. The "city" refers to Jerusalem, the center of religious and political life in Judah, while "all the villages around it" includes the surrounding areas, showing that the judgment is comprehensive. The disasters mentioned are the consequences of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which were to befall Israel if they disobeyed God. This prophecy was fulfilled with the Babylonian invasion and the subsequent destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC.<p><b>because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words:</b><br>The phrase "stiffened their necks" is a metaphor for stubbornness and rebellion, often used in the Old Testament to describe Israel's resistance to God's commands (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>). This imagery suggests an unwillingness to submit to God's authority, akin to an ox resisting the yoke. The refusal to "heed My words" indicates a rejection of the prophetic messages delivered by Jeremiah and other prophets, who called the people to repentance. This disobedience is the root cause of the impending judgment, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.
