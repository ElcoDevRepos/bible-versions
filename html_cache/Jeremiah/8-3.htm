The concept of banishment or exile is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often seen as a consequence of breaking the covenant with God. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian exile, where many were taken from their homeland. Theologically, it reflects the separation from God due to sin, a theme that is echoed in the New Testament with the idea of spiritual exile from God's presence.<p><b>the remnant of this evil family</b><br>The term "remnant" is significant in biblical prophecy, often referring to a small, faithful group preserved by God despite widespread apostasy. Here, however, it refers to those who survive the initial judgment but remain unrepentant. The "evil family" denotes the people of Judah who have turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and injustice. This highlights the moral and spiritual decline of the nation, which is a central theme in the prophetic books.<p><b>will choose death over life,&#8221;</b><br>This choice reflects the spiritual blindness and despair of the people. Despite the opportunity for repentance and restoration, they persist in their rebellion, leading to spiritual and physical death. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, where God sets before the people life and death, urging them to choose life. The choice of death over life symbolizes the ultimate rejection of God's covenant and blessings.<p><b>declares the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all creation, including the heavenly armies. It underscores the authority behind the prophetic message and the certainty of its fulfillment. This declaration serves as a reminder of God's control over history and His ability to execute judgment. It also points to the hope of eventual restoration, as God's purposes are ultimately redemptive, a theme fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who offers life to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

This underscores His sovereign justice&#8212;when His people persist in rebellion, He enforces the covenant curses He warned about in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/29-28.htm">Deuteronomy 29:28</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;wherever&#8221; widens the scope: there will be no safe pocket of resistance, no corner where the consequences of sin can be avoided (<a href="/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even in banishment, God&#8217;s hand is purposeful. Later He will use that same scattering to preserve a remnant and ultimately regather them (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-16.htm">Ezekiel 11:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the remnant of this evil family</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Remnant&#8221; normally carries a hopeful ring in Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20&#8211;22</a>). Here, however, Jeremiah stresses that the remaining group still clings to evil. They have survived physically, but spiritually they remain hardened (<a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;family&#8221; is the nation of Judah, descended from the patriarchs yet now characterized by idolatry and injustice (<a href="/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant discipline distinguishes between a faithful remnant and an evil remnant. The faithful remnant will repent (<a href="/jeremiah/31-7.htm">Jeremiah 31:7&#8211;9</a>), while the evil remnant remains obstinate and faces intensified judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will choose death over life</b><p>&#8226; Moses once placed a similar choice before Israel&#8212;&#8220;I have set before you life and death&#8230; now choose life&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>). Here the people make the opposite decision.<p>&#8226; Their &#8220;choice&#8221; is not a conscious desire to die for righteousness; it is the inevitable outcome of rejecting God&#8217;s life-giving word (<a href="/proverbs/8-36.htm">Proverbs 8:36</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-9.htm">Hosea 13:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin dulls spiritual senses until what should be feared (death) feels preferable to what is offered (life). In their despair, the exiles will crave death rather than endure God&#8217;s discipline (<a href="/revelation/9-6.htm">Revelation 9:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This verse soberly reminds us that persistent rebellion leads to a point where the heart prefers ruin over repentance (<a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28&#8211;32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD of Hosts</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;LORD of Hosts&#8221; (YHWH Sabaoth) spotlights God as Commander of angelic armies and Ruler over every earthly power (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>).<p>&#8226; His declaration is final; no kingdom, no remnant, no individual can overturn it (<a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Lord Himself says it, the warning carries absolute certainty&#8212;yet the same title later introduces promises of restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>). Judgment and mercy both flow from the same sovereign mouth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/8-3.htm">Jeremiah 8:3</a> shows the dreadful climax of Judah&#8217;s rebellion. God will scatter them (&#8220;wherever I have banished them&#8221;), leaving only an &#8220;evil&#8221; remnant still resistant to His word. Their hardened hearts will &#8220;choose death over life,&#8221; proving the devastating consequences of sin. The verse closes with the weighty authority of the &#8220;LORD of Hosts,&#8221; sealing the certainty of His judgment. Yet the broader message of Jeremiah assures us that divine discipline aims at eventual restoration for those who repent, urging every generation to embrace the life God freely offers through obedience and faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The residue of them that remain.</span>--Once more the emphasis of re-iteration, "the remnant of a remnant."
