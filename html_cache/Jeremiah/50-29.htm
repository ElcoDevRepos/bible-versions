The archers symbolize a formidable force, as archery was a key component of ancient warfare. Babylon, located in present-day Iraq, was a dominant empire, and this call to arms signifies a divine judgment against it. The use of archers highlights the precision and inevitability of God's judgment.<p><b>Encamp all around her; let no one escape.</b><br>The encampment around Babylon suggests a siege, a common military tactic in ancient times to cut off supplies and force surrender. This imagery indicates total encirclement, ensuring that Babylon's fall is complete and inescapable. Historically, Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians, fulfilling this prophecy. The phrase underscores the thoroughness of divine retribution.<p><b>Repay her according to her deeds; do to her as she has done.</b><br>This reflects the biblical principle of retributive justice, where actions are met with equivalent consequences. Babylon's history of conquest and oppression is being addressed here. The concept of "measure for measure" is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>, emphasizing God's justice. Babylon's own actions become the standard for her judgment.<p><b>For she has defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.</b><br>Babylon's defiance is not just against other nations but against God Himself. The title "the Holy One of Israel" emphasizes God's unique relationship with His people and His holiness. Babylon's arrogance and idolatry are seen as direct affronts to God's sovereignty. This defiance is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, where nations that oppose God and His people face inevitable judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its wealth and military might, Babylon is often depicted in the Bible as a symbol of pride and opposition to God.
