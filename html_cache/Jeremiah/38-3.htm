In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet often begins his declarations with this phrase to assert that the message is not his own but from God. This underscores the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces. The phrase is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God communicates His will and intentions through chosen individuals.<p><b>This city will surely be delivered into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon:</b><br>The "city" refers to Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, which was under siege by Babylon. Historically, this period is around 587-586 BC, during the reign of King Zedekiah. The phrase "delivered into the hands" indicates a transfer of control, suggesting divine judgment and fulfillment of prophecy. The Babylonian army, led by King Nebuchadnezzar, was a formidable force, and their conquest of Jerusalem was a pivotal event in Jewish history. This prophecy aligns with earlier warnings given by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>) and reflects the consequences of Judah's persistent disobedience and idolatry.<p><b>and he will capture it.&#8221;</b><br>The "he" refers to the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar. The capture of Jerusalem was not just a military defeat but also a significant theological event, symbolizing God's judgment on His people for their unfaithfulness. This event is corroborated by archaeological findings, such as the Babylonian Chronicles, which record the siege and fall of Jerusalem. Theologically, this moment foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and restoration that God promises, pointing to the hope of redemption and the coming of the Messiah. The capture of Jerusalem serves as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where judgment leads to eventual restoration and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
