The context is the aftermath of the Babylonian exile, where the people of Judah have not repented despite witnessing the consequences of their disobedience. It underscores the stubbornness and continuity of their rebellion against God.<p><b>they have not humbled themselves</b><br>Humility before God is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with repentance and obedience (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The lack of humility here suggests a refusal to acknowledge their sins and submit to God's authority, which is a central issue throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>or shown reverence</b><br>Reverence for God involves fear, respect, and worship. The Israelites' failure to show reverence is indicative of their idolatry and spiritual adultery, as they turned to other gods (<a href="/jeremiah/44-3.htm">Jeremiah 44:3</a>). This lack of reverence is a violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>nor have they followed My instruction</b><br>God's instructions were given through the Law of Moses and the prophets. The people's failure to follow these instructions highlights their disobedience and disregard for God's covenant, which was meant to guide them in righteousness and justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-3</a>).<p><b>or the statutes that I set before you and your fathers</b><br>The statutes refer to the specific laws and decrees given by God. The mention of "your fathers" connects the current generation's disobedience to a historical pattern of rebellion, as seen throughout Israel's history (<a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>). This continuity of disobedience emphasizes the need for a new covenant, which is later prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a> and fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

From the reign of Josiah&#8217;s sons through the fall of Jerusalem and now in Egypt, the same defiance persists (<a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-14.htm">2 Kings 17:14</a>). God&#8217;s patience stretches across decades, yet the phrase &#8220;to this day&#8221; underscores that time alone has not softened their hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have not humbled themselves</b><p>Humility is the doorway to mercy (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>; <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>), but Judah refuses to bow. Pride keeps them clinging to idols, convinced they know better than the Lord. Jeremiah contrasts their stiff necks with God&#8217;s repeated calls to repent (<a href="/jeremiah/13-15.htm">Jeremiah 13:15&#8211;17</a>). Like Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>, they remain unbent even after judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or shown reverence</b><p>Reverence&#8212;holy fear mixed with love&#8212;is missing (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>). Instead of awe, they treat God casually, turning to the &#8220;queen of heaven&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>). <a href="/romans/3-18.htm">Romans 3:18</a> describes the result: &#8220;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&#8221; Lack of reverence cripples obedience because people obey only whom they respect.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor have they followed My instruction</b><p>God&#8217;s &#8220;instruction&#8221; (torah) is more than rules; it is His loving guidance (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-10.htm">Deuteronomy 30:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>). Rejecting it leaves Judah without the light for their path (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). Jesus echoes this principle: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Love and obedience are inseparable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or the statutes that I set before you and your fathers</b><p>From Sinai onward, God clearly laid out His statutes (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-1.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1&#8211;2</a>). Generations heard them; few kept them. <a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5&#8211;8</a> recounts how Israel&#8217;s fathers were to teach the law to their children so they would &#8220;set their hope in God.&#8221; Judah&#8217;s current rebellion breaks that intergenerational chain, proving the danger of neglecting God&#8217;s revealed standards (<a href="/nehemiah/9-13.htm">Nehemiah 9:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/44-10.htm">Jeremiah 44:10</a> exposes a tragic cycle: persistent pride, absence of reverence, and willful disobedience keep Judah under judgment even &#8220;to this day.&#8221; God&#8217;s statutes stand unchanged; the problem lies in hearts that refuse to humble themselves. The passage urges us to respond differently&#8212;embracing humility, cultivating reverence, and walking in wholehearted obedience so that history&#8217;s warning becomes our invitation to faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are not humbled;</span> rather, <span class="accented">not made contrite</span> (literally, <span class="accented">not crushed</span>, viz. by repentance). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/44-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">To</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
