Horses were highly valued in battle for their speed and strength, and riders were skilled warriors. The imagery here is reminiscent of the Exodus narrative, where God overthrew Pharaoh's chariots and horsemen in the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>). This demonstrates God's sovereignty over nations and their armies, emphasizing that no military power can stand against His will. The use of "with you" indicates that God is using His chosen instrument, likely referring to the Medes and Persians, to execute His judgment on Babylon. This also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ, who will defeat all earthly powers (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).<p><b>with you I shatter the chariot and driver.</b><br>Chariots were another crucial element of ancient military forces, representing technological advancement and strategic advantage in warfare. The destruction of both chariot and driver signifies a complete dismantling of Babylon's military capabilities. This echoes the fate of Sisera's army in <a href="/judges/4-15.htm">Judges 4:15</a>, where God intervened to deliver Israel from oppression. The repetition of "with you" underscores the idea that God empowers His chosen agents to fulfill His purposes. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who, through His followers, will bring about the ultimate defeat of evil. The imagery of shattering conveys total destruction, leaving no room for recovery, highlighting the finality of God's judgment against Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that Jeremiah prophesied against, symbolizing human pride and opposition to God.

God promises to break that very strength.<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, horsemen symbolize human confidence in speed and strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). God reminds His people that such confidence is futile when He moves in judgment.<p>&#8226; Echoes of <a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1&#8211;4</a> show the same pattern: &#8220;horse and rider&#8221; were drowned in the Red Sea, proving again that no military prowess can stand before the Lord.<p>&#8226; Application: God may use ordinary people or even rival nations to dismantle seemingly unbeatable powers. His sovereignty extends over every battlefield, reassuring believers that no opposition is beyond His reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With you I shatter the chariot and driver</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/51-21.htm">Jeremiah 51:21</a>b: &#8220;with you I shatter the chariot and driver.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Chariots represented the pinnacle of ancient military technology (<a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>). Breaking them means dismantling Babylon&#8217;s most advanced weaponry.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;driver&#8221; (or charioteer) is the trained elite who maneuvered these machines. God targets both the hardware and the skilled personnel, leaving nothing intact.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a> praises God for making &#8220;wars cease &#8230; He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.&#8221; Jeremiah&#8217;s wording brings the same truth into Babylon&#8217;s downfall.<p>&#8226; By repeating &#8220;with you,&#8221; the Lord underscores partnership: He acts through human agents yet remains the true source of power (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Application: Even the best&#8208;funded, best&#8208;trained systems collapse when God decrees it. Believers can rest in His ultimate control while staying ready to serve as instruments of His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/51-21.htm">Jeremiah 51:21</a> pictures God&#8217;s total overthrow of Babylon&#8217;s military might. He will use His chosen agent to smash cavalry, chariots, riders, and drivers alike&#8212;every level of power from technology to personnel. The verse assures us that the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty is absolute, His Word unfailing, and all human strength fragile before Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/51-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">With you I shatter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nip&#183;pa&#7779;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
