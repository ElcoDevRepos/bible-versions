These acts demonstrated God's power and sovereignty over creation and the false gods of Egypt. The plagues were not only judgments against Egypt but also a means to liberate the Israelites, showcasing God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>). The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, often referenced throughout the Old Testament as a symbol of deliverance and God's mighty hand (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-21.htm">Deuteronomy 6:21-23</a>).<p><b>and You do so to this very day</b><br>This indicates that God's miraculous interventions were not limited to the past but continued in the present. In Jeremiah's time, this could refer to God's ongoing protection and guidance of Israel despite their disobedience and the looming Babylonian exile. It underscores the belief in God's unchanging nature and His continuous involvement in the world. This ongoing activity of God is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus performs miracles, affirming God's active presence among His people (<a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>).<p><b>both in Israel and among all mankind</b><br>God's actions are not confined to Israel but extend to all nations, highlighting His universal sovereignty. This reflects the Abrahamic promise that through Israel, all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The miracles in Egypt were witnessed by other nations, spreading the fame of Yahweh beyond Israel (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). In the New Testament, this foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the salvation plan through Christ (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p><b>And You have made a name for Yourself</b><br>God's actions in history have established His reputation as the one true God. The phrase "made a name" implies renown and honor, often associated with God's covenantal faithfulness and mighty deeds. This is seen in the way nations feared Israel because of God's past acts (<a href="/joshua/9-9.htm">Joshua 9:9</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus' works and resurrection further glorify God's name, fulfilling the ultimate revelation of His character and purpose (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>as is the case to this day</b><br>This emphasizes the enduring impact of God's deeds and His established reputation. It suggests that the evidence of God's power and faithfulness is still apparent and recognized. In Jeremiah's context, despite the impending judgment, God's past faithfulness provides hope for future restoration. This enduring legacy is mirrored in the New Testament, where the church continues to testify to God's work through Christ, maintaining His name's renown (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant location in biblical history, where God performed mighty acts to deliver the Israelites from slavery, showcasing His power and sovereignty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who witnessed His signs and wonders throughout their history, from the Exodus to the present context of Jeremiah's prophecy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_wonders.htm">Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous acts performed by God to demonstrate His power and authority, often serving as a testament to His covenant with His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mankind.htm">Mankind</a></b><br>Refers to all humanity, indicating that God's actions and His reputation extend beyond Israel to the entire world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God's ability to perform signs and wonders demonstrates His ultimate authority over creation and history.
