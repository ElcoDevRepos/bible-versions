Johanan&#8217;s group overturns that order, proving that human rebellion can squander divine mercy.<p>&#8226; Gedaliah&#8217;s murder in chapter 41 opened the door to panic, yet God still offered hope if they stayed (<a href="/jeremiah/42-11.htm">Jeremiah 42:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Their mass departure demonstrates how quickly a community can shift from faith to fear when leadership falters (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeremiah the prophet</b><p>Remarkably, God&#8217;s own spokesman is dragged along. Jeremiah had warned, &#8220;Do not go to Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19</a>). His inclusion testifies that faithful servants can suffer alongside those they seek to help&#8212;yet God vindicates them in the end (<a href="/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s presence ensures God&#8217;s voice will follow the people into Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/44-1.htm">Jeremiah 44:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His forced journey mirrors Joseph&#8217;s earlier descent to Egypt, yet here it highlights judgment, not deliverance (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a> vs. <a href="/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Baruch son of Neriah</b><p>Baruch, Jeremiah&#8217;s loyal scribe (<a href="/jeremiah/36-4.htm">Jeremiah 36:4</a>; 45:1), shares his mentor&#8217;s plight. Baruch once feared for his own future, but God promised him life as a prize of war (<a href="/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>). His inclusion here displays that promise in action: even amid collective disobedience, God preserves His faithful servants.<p>&#8226; Baruch&#8217;s unwavering partnership models steadfast discipleship (<a href="/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Together, Jeremiah and Baruch embody the truth that God&#8217;s Word cannot be silenced by forced migration (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a> catalogs every stratum of society&#8212;men, women, children, royalty, commoners, prophet, and scribe&#8212;to show that the entire remnant chose flight over faith. God had miraculously left them in the land under Gedaliah, promising protection, yet fear and mistrust drove them back to the very place of past bondage. The verse warns that disobedience sweeps up whole communities, yet it also highlights God&#8217;s steadfast care for the faithful few. Even when the majority run from His will, He escorts His servants into the unknown and keeps His word unbroken.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the men,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1440;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun -
