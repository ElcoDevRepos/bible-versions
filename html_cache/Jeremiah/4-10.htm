His use of "Ah, Lord GOD" reflects a lament or a cry of distress, indicating the gravity of the situation. This phrase shows Jeremiah's intimate relationship with God, where he feels free to express his confusion and anguish. The title "Lord GOD" emphasizes God's sovereignty and authority, a reminder of His ultimate control over the events unfolding.<p><b>how completely You have deceived this people and Jerusalem</b><br>This phrase reflects Jeremiah's struggle with the apparent contradiction between God's promises and the current reality. The word "deceived" is strong, indicating a deep sense of betrayal felt by the prophet. Historically, false prophets in Jerusalem were proclaiming peace, contradicting Jeremiah's warnings of impending judgment. This tension highlights the conflict between true and false prophecy, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. It also underscores the people's misunderstanding of God's messages, often due to their own desires and the misleading assurances of false prophets.<p><b>by saying, &#8216;You will have peace,&#8217;</b><br>The promise of peace was a common message from false prophets during Jeremiah's time. They assured the people that God would not allow Jerusalem to fall, despite their persistent sin and rebellion. This false sense of security was dangerous, as it led the people to ignore calls for repentance. The concept of peace in the Hebrew context (shalom) encompasses not just the absence of conflict but also completeness and well-being, which the people were falsely led to believe they would enjoy.<p><b>while a sword is at our throats.&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of a sword at the throat is vivid and alarming, symbolizing imminent danger and destruction. This phrase captures the urgency and severity of the threat facing Jerusalem due to their disobedience. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian threat, which was a direct consequence of the nation's unfaithfulness to God. The sword is often used in Scripture as a symbol of divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). This stark contrast between the false promise of peace and the reality of impending judgment serves as a powerful warning against complacency and the dangers of ignoring God's true prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The verse exposes the peril of trusting soothing voices over God&#8217;s clear word, yet it also affirms divine sovereignty&#8212;God permits delusion only after truth has been rejected. For every generation the lesson stands: weigh every optimistic promise against the unchanging Scriptures, turn from sin while there is still time, and rest in the righteousness of a God who never deceives but sometimes lets our chosen illusions run their course to bring us back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Ah, Lord God! </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">my Lord Jehovah!</span>) <span class= "bld">surely thou hast greatly deceived this people.</span>--The words are startling, but are eminently characteristic. Jeremiah had been led to utter words that told of desolation and destruction. But if these were true, what was he to think of the words of the other prophets, who, speaking in the name of the Lord, had promised peace through the reign of Josiah, and even under Jehoiakim? Had not Jehovah apparently sanctioned those prophets also? and, if so, had He not deceived the people? (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7</a>.) This seems, on the whole, preferable to the interpretations which see in it a dramatic irony representing the prophet as having shared in the hopes of the people and awakening to a terrible disappointment, or refer the words to the contrast between the glorious visions of the future in Isaiah and his own terrible predictions, or to the bolder course of an alteration of the text, so that the words would run "it is said," the complaint being represented as coming from the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ah, Lord God</span>! rather, Alas! O <span class="accented">Lord Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> on Jeremiah 1:6). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast greatly deceived this people</span>, etc. Much difficulty has been felt in interpreting this verse, partly because it seems directly to charge Jehovah with "deceit," and partly because the prophecy, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall have peace</span>, on which this charge is founded, accords exactly with the strain of the "false prophets" (see <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>). Hence some (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Ewald) have altered the points of the verb at the beginning of the verse., so as to enable them to render. "And one shall <span class="accented">say</span>," <span class="accented">the</span> subject understood being either a "false prophet" or one of the people. This view is not in itself impossible (Keil's objection will not bear examination), but is not absolutely necessary, for the present is not the only passage in which Jeremiah, under the influence of strong emotion, charges Jehovah with "deceit" (see <a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>, a synonymous word is used; and comp. <a href="/1_kings/22-23.htm">1 Kings 22:23</a>), and the words, "Ye shall have peace, may be meant to summarize the cheering promises in <a href="/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14-18</a>. Jeremiah may (it is not incorrect to conjecture) have supposed the fulfillment of his prophecy to be nearer than it really was (comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>); hence his disappointment, and hence his strong language. So St. Jerome, "Quia supra dixerat, In illo tempore vocabunt Jerusalem solium Dei, etc.. et nunc dicit, Peribit cor regis, turbatur propheta et in se Deum putat esse meutitum; nec intelligit, illud multa post tempera repromissum, hoc autem vicino futurum tempore." To suppose, with Keil, that Jeremiah refers the prophecies of the "false prophets" to God as their ultimate Author, seems inconsistent with Jeremiah's own statements in <a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/5-13.htm">Jeremiah 5:13</a>). Moreover, we have parallels elsewhere in the prophets, as well as in the Book of Job, for the use of language with regard to Providence which a calmer judgment would condemn. A notable instance is <a href="/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>, where the Jewish Church, through its mouthpiece the prophet, throws the responsibility of its errors upon Jehovah. Depressed by melancholy, they give way for the moment to those human "thoughts" which are not as "My thoughts." They felt the "burden of the mystery." <span class="cmt_word">Unto the soul</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. unto the life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
