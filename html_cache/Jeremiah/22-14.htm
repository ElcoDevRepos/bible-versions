In the ancient Near East, building grand palaces was a common way for kings to display their power and wealth. The "spacious upper rooms" suggest a desire for opulence and status. This attitude contrasts with the biblical call for leaders to serve their people and uphold God's laws, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>, where kings are instructed to remain humble and obedient to God's commandments.<p><b>So he cuts windows in it,</b><br>The act of cutting windows indicates a focus on architectural beauty and comfort, which was a luxury in ancient times. Windows in palaces were often a sign of wealth, as they required skilled craftsmanship. This detail highlights the king's preoccupation with personal comfort and aesthetic appeal, rather than the needs of his people. The prophet Jeremiah criticizes this self-centeredness, reminding the king of his duty to execute justice and righteousness (<a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>).<p><b>panels it with cedar,</b><br>Cedar wood was highly prized in the ancient world for its durability and pleasant aroma. It was often imported from Lebanon, making it a symbol of wealth and international trade. The use of cedar in construction is reminiscent of Solomon's temple and palace (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9-10</a>), but unlike Solomon, who initially sought wisdom and God's favor, Jehoiakim's use of cedar is portrayed as an act of vanity and misplaced priorities.<p><b>and paints it with vermilion.</b><br>Vermilion, a bright red pigment, was used for decoration and signified luxury and extravagance. In the Bible, red is often associated with sin and judgment (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>), which may imply a critique of the king's moral state. The use of vermilion further emphasizes the king's focus on external appearances rather than internal righteousness. This critique aligns with the broader biblical theme that God values the heart and character over outward appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
