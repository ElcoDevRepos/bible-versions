It reflects God's concern for social justice and economic balance within the Israelite community. The seventh year was a time of release, not only for the land (<a href="/leviticus/25-4.htm">Leviticus 25:4</a>) but also for Hebrew servants. This practice ensured that no Israelite would remain in perpetual servitude, emphasizing the value of freedom and the dignity of every individual. It also served as a reminder of Israel's own deliverance from slavery in Egypt, reinforcing their identity as a people set apart for God.<p><b>He may serve you six years, but then you must let him go free.</b><br>The six-year period of service was a form of indentured servitude, often entered into voluntarily due to economic hardship. This arrangement was not meant to be oppressive but rather a means of survival and eventual restoration. The release in the seventh year symbolized a new beginning and was an act of mercy and obedience to God's law. This cycle of service and release can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He frees believers from the bondage of sin, offering a new life in Him.<p><b>But your fathers did not listen or incline their ear.</b><br>This phrase highlights the historical disobedience of the Israelites, who repeatedly ignored God's commands. The failure to observe the Sabbatical Year and release Hebrew servants was symptomatic of a broader pattern of rebellion against God's covenant. This disobedience led to social injustice and contributed to the moral and spiritual decline of the nation. The prophets, including Jeremiah, often called the people to repentance, warning of the consequences of their unfaithfulness. This failure to listen and obey is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the need for a heart responsive to God's word and the importance of aligning one's actions with His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrews.htm">Hebrews</a></b><br>The people of Israel, specifically those who were in servitude and were to be released in the seventh year.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jeremiah prophesied, and where the people were not following God's command regarding the release of Hebrew servants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seventh_year.htm">The Seventh Year</a></b><br>A sabbatical year, as commanded by God, for the release of Hebrew servants, reflecting God's provision and mercy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ancestors.htm">The Ancestors</a></b><br>The forefathers of the people of Judah who failed to obey God's command regarding the release of servants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The importance of adhering to God's laws, as they are designed for justice and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_rest_and_release.htm">The Principle of Rest and Release</a></b><br>Understanding the sabbatical year as a time of rest and liberation, reflecting God's character and care for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_context_and_relevance.htm">Historical Context and Relevance</a></b><br>Recognizing the historical disobedience of the Israelites and applying the lessons learned to our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_freedom.htm">Spiritual Freedom</a></b><br>Drawing parallels between physical release from servitude and spiritual freedom in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>Emphasizing the role of the community in ensuring justice and mercy are practiced, reflecting God's heart for the oppressed.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_34_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 34:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_34_14_s_relevance_today.htm">How does Jeremiah 34:14 emphasize the importance of keeping God's commandments today?
