The command to "take wives and have sons and daughters" emphasizes the importance of family and continuity even in adverse circumstances. It reflects God's desire for His people to thrive and maintain their identity despite being in a foreign land. This instruction aligns with the cultural norms of the time, where marriage and procreation were seen as essential for the survival and growth of a community. The emphasis on family can also be seen in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where God commands humanity to "be fruitful and multiply."<p><b>Take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage,</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of generational continuity and the establishment of stable family units. In the ancient Near Eastern context, arranging marriages was a parental responsibility, ensuring alliances and the continuation of family lines. This practice is evident throughout the Old Testament, such as in the story of Isaac and Rebekah (Genesis 24). The instruction to arrange marriages for their children indicates a long-term perspective, encouraging the exiles to settle and integrate into their new environment while maintaining their distinct cultural and religious identity.<p><b>so that they too may have sons and daughters.</b><br>The focus here is on the perpetuation of the community through successive generations. This reflects a hope and assurance that the exile is not the end of the Israelite people. It also highlights the importance of legacy and the transmission of faith and values to future generations. This idea is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children diligently.<p><b>Multiply there; do not decrease.</b><br>This command is a call to growth and prosperity even in exile. It reassures the Israelites that God has not abandoned them and that they have a future. The instruction to "multiply" is reminiscent of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, where He promises to make Abraham's descendants a great nation. The encouragement to "not decrease" serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the assurance that the exile is temporary. It also reflects a broader biblical theme of hope and restoration, as seen in the eventual return of the exiles to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages to the people of Judah, including those exiled in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/exiles_in_babylon.htm">Exiles in Babylon</a></b><br>The people of Judah who were taken captive by King Nebuchadnezzar and lived in Babylon during the Babylonian exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites were exiled, representing a period of judgment and discipline from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority who speaks through Jeremiah, providing guidance and hope to His people even in exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/families.htm">Families</a></b><br>The focus of the command in this verse, emphasizing the importance of family growth and continuity even in difficult circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_exile.htm">God's Sovereignty in Exile</a></b><br>Even in difficult circumstances, God has a plan for His people.

Much like Noah&#8217;s sons after the flood (<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>) and Israel in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/36-6.htm">Numbers 36:6</a>), the exiles are to embrace covenant marriage:<p>&#8226; Marriage remains a divine gift (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>).<p>&#8226; It safeguards purity (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>) and pictures Christ&#8217;s relationship with His people (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>).<p>By commanding marriage in exile, the Lord confirms that His promises reach even into a foreign land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have sons and daughters</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;and have sons and daughters.&#8221; Children are a heritage from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>), and procreation fulfills God&#8217;s original blessing, &#8220;Be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).
