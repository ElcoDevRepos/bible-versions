In the biblical context, true prophets were those who spoke the words given by God, often confirmed by the fulfillment of their prophecies (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>). Jeremiah contrasts himself with false prophets who were misleading the people with messages of peace and security when destruction was imminent.<p><b>and the word of the LORD is with them</b><br>The "word of the LORD" signifies divine revelation and authority. In the Old Testament, prophets like Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah were known for receiving direct messages from God. This phrase implies that true prophets would have genuine communication with God, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>, where the word of the LORD was rare, indicating the scarcity of true prophetic messages.<p><b>let them now plead with the LORD of Hosts</b><br>"Plead" suggests intercession, a role often associated with prophets (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). The "LORD of Hosts" is a title emphasizing God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, underscoring His power and authority. This call to intercession highlights the seriousness of the situation and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>that the articles remaining in the house of the LORD</b><br>The "articles" refer to sacred items used in temple worship, such as those described in <a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48-50</a>. These items were central to the religious life of Israel and symbolized God's presence among His people. Their removal would signify a loss of divine favor and protection.<p><b>in the palace of the king of Judah</b><br>The palace was not only the king's residence but also a symbol of the nation's political stability and strength. The mention of the palace indicates that the threat from Babylon was not only religious but also political, affecting the entire structure of Judah's society.<p><b>and in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the spiritual and political heart of Judah, the city where God had chosen to place His name (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>). Its mention underscores the gravity of the threat, as the city was central to Jewish identity and faith.<p><b>not be taken to Babylon</b><br>Babylon represents the looming threat of exile and judgment. Historically, Babylon was a dominant empire known for its military prowess and cultural influence. The taking of articles to Babylon would fulfill prophecies of judgment (<a href="/2_kings/20-17.htm">2 Kings 20:17-18</a>) and symbolize the subjugation of God's people, foreshadowing the eventual Babylonian captivity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to those who claimed to speak on behalf of God during Jeremiah's time, some of whom were false prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, central to Jewish worship and the presence of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire that conquered Judah and took many of its people and treasures into exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_of_true_prophets.htm">Discernment of True Prophets</a></b><br>Believers must seek discernment to identify true messages from God, distinguishing them from false teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercessory_prayer.htm">The Power of Intercessory Prayer</a></b><br>Jeremiah challenges the prophets to plead with God, highlighting the importance and power of intercessory prayer in seeking God's intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" reminds us of God's ultimate authority and control over all events, encouraging trust in His plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_genuine_worship.htm">The Importance of Genuine Worship</a></b><br>The temple's significance underscores the need for sincere worship and reverence for God's presence in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_trials.htm">Preparation for Trials</a></b><br>Just as Jeremiah warned of impending exile, believers are called to prepare spiritually for trials, trusting in God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_27_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 27:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_27_18_True_prophecy_s_role.htm">How does Jeremiah 27:18 emphasize the importance of true prophecy and prayer?

By opening with an &#8220;if,&#8221; Jeremiah exposes the possibility that these voices are counterfeit, comforting the nation with lies (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>). His test invites listeners to weigh leaders carefully rather than accept every spiritual claim at face value (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the word of the LORD is with them</b><p>A true prophet does not invent messages; he carries the very word of God (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>; 5:13; <a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>). If these men really possess that word, their authority will match their intimacy with the Lord.

Jeremiah dares the would-be prophets: if they truly know God, let them pray for tangible preservation, not empty optimism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the articles remaining in the house of the LORD</b><p>Nebuchadnezzar has already carried off many sacred vessels (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>). Only a fraction remain (<a href="/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17-19</a>). These objects symbolize covenant worship; their loss would dim Israel&#8217;s witness. A real prophetic task, therefore, is to seek God&#8217;s protection over what is left rather than promise quick reversal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the palace of the king of Judah</b><p>The royal treasury, once filled with Solomon&#8217;s splendor, now stands under threat (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-18.htm">2 Chronicles 36:18</a>).

Intercession must cover the whole community hierarchy, not just religious artifacts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in Jerusalem</b><p>The fragile peace within the city hangs by a thread (<a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17-23</a>).

Jeremiah does not deny exile; he had already predicted seventy years away (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). Yet he invites genuine prophets to pray that God temper the blow, preserving a remnant of worship tools and royal wealth&#8212;a vivid way to test whether their prayers move heaven or their words merely tickle ears (<a href="/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/27-18.htm">Jeremiah 27:18</a> turns the spotlight on spiritual integrity.
