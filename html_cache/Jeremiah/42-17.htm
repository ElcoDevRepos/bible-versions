Historically, Egypt was often seen as a place of refuge due to its relative stability and resources. However, God had warned the Israelites against seeking alliances with Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>). The decision to go to Egypt reflects a lack of trust in God's promises and a return to old patterns of relying on foreign powers instead of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>).<p><b>will die by sword and famine and plague.</b><br>These three forms of judgment&#8212;sword, famine, and plague&#8212;are frequently mentioned in the Old Testament as instruments of divine punishment (<a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>). They signify total destruction and are reminiscent of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience. This triad of calamities underscores the severity of God's judgment against those who disobey His command to remain in the land He promised to them.<p><b>Not one of them will survive or escape</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the certainty and totality of the judgment. It reflects the prophetic nature of Jeremiah's message, where God's word is absolute and unchangeable. The idea of no escape is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, highlighting the inescapability of divine judgment (<a href="/amos/9.htm">Amos 9:1-4</a>).<p><b>the disaster I will bring upon them.</b><br>The disaster is a direct consequence of disobedience to God's command. It serves as a fulfillment of prophetic warnings and a demonstration of God's sovereignty and justice. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's judgment against sin and rebellion, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) and the Babylonian exile itself. The disaster is not merely a natural consequence but a divinely orchestrated event, reinforcing the seriousness of turning away from God's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

The real issue is spiritual allegiance, not geography.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/42-17.htm">Jeremiah 42:17</a> declares that every Judean who stubbornly relocates to Egypt will meet death by sword, famine, and plague, with no survivors. The verse underscores that fleeing God&#8217;s will invites comprehensive judgment, while staying in the place of obedience secures His protection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">So shall it be with all the men . . .</span>--The words possibly imply that others were taking the same course as those who had applied to Jeremiah. There was something like a "rush" from many nations--Moab, Edom, and others (<a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm" title="And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;">Jeremiah 27:3</a>)--of fugitives, looking to Egypt as their one hope of safety against the Chaldaeans, and joining with the Jews that had sought shelter in their respective territories (<a href="/jeremiah/40-11.htm" title="Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;">Jeremiah 40:11</a>). We note in the prophet's warning the recurrence of the old familiar phrases, "by the sword, by the famine, by the pestilence" (<a href="/jeremiah/24-10.htm" title="And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.">Jeremiah 24:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/6-11.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Smite with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.">Ezekiel 6:11</a>), of an "execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach" (<a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm" title="And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.">Jeremiah 24:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm" title="Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.">Jeremiah 26:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-18.htm" title="And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them:">Jeremiah 29:18</a>). They would involve themselves by rejecting his counsels in all the worst evils that he had prophesied before.
