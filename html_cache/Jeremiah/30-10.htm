The use of "Jacob" emphasizes the covenant relationship established with the patriarchs. The command "do not be afraid" is a common biblical reassurance, found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God promises His presence and support. It reflects God's sovereignty and faithfulness, encouraging trust despite current circumstances.<p><b>and do not be dismayed, O Israel</b><br>"Dismayed" suggests a loss of courage or hope. The dual mention of "Jacob" and "Israel" underscores the unity and continuity of God's people. Historically, Israel faced numerous threats, including exile and oppression. This reassurance is a reminder of God's unchanging commitment, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-8.htm">Deuteronomy 31:8</a>, where God promises never to leave nor forsake His people.<p><b>For I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their captivity!</b><br>This promise of salvation from a "distant place" refers to the Babylonian exile, a significant event in Israel's history. The phrase highlights God's power to redeem and restore, as He did in the Exodus from Egypt. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who brings spiritual freedom from sin. The return from captivity is a type of the greater salvation found in Jesus.<p><b>Jacob will return to quiet and ease, with no one to make him afraid</b><br>The promise of returning to "quiet and ease" signifies peace and security, contrasting with the turmoil of exile. This peace is reminiscent of the rest promised in the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>). It also points to the eschatological peace in the Messianic kingdom, where Christ reigns as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>). The assurance of "no one to make him afraid" reflects the ultimate victory over enemies, both physical and spiritual, through God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, often used to refer to the collective people of God.

In this context, it refers to the people of God who are in exile and in need of reassurance and deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the speaker in this passage, providing assurance and promise of salvation to His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/captivity.htm">Captivity</a></b><br>Refers to the Babylonian exile, a period when the Israelites were taken from their homeland and held in Babylon. It symbolizes a time of punishment but also a period of hope for future restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/return_and_restoration.htm">Return and Restoration</a></b><br>The promise that God will bring His people back to their land, where they will live in peace and security, free from fear.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_assurance_in_times_of_fear.htm">God&#8217;s Assurance in Times of Fear</a></b><br>God repeatedly tells His people not to be afraid, highlighting His role as a protector and savior.

This can be a source of hope for those feeling distant from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_peace_and_security.htm">Living in Peace and Security</a></b><br>The promise of living without fear is a reminder that true peace comes from God.

Literally fulfilled in Israel&#8217;s return from Babylon and awaiting ultimate completion in Christ&#8217;s kingdom, the verse also assures every believer that the Lord who redeems, restores, and protects keeps every word He speaks.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Therefore fear thou not.</span>--The higher strain of language into which the prophecy has here risen is indicated by the parallelism of the two clauses in each member of the sentence. The whole verse is poetic in its form. The words have in them something of the ring of <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm" title="Fear you not; for I am with you: be not dismayed; for I am your God: I will strengthen you; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.">Isaiah 41:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob,</span> etc. These two verses, omitted in the Septuagint, are among the passages which Hitzig (carrying out an idea of Movers) attributes to the editorial hand of the author (a pious Jew of the Captivity, according to him) of <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>, and it cannot be denied that the tone and phraseolegy of ver. 10 is more akin to that of <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>:66, than to those of the greater part of Jeremiah. Graf, in controverting Hitzig's view, points out, however, that the expressions referred to by Hitzig as "Deutero-Isaianic," are also found in other books besides the latter part of Isaiah, and that, on the other hand, "the expressions of ver. 11 are all as foreign to <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>, as they are current in Jeremiah." As for the expression, "my servant Jacob." (which. only occurs again in Jeremiah in the duplicate of this passage, <a href="/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27, 28</a>, and which is specially characteristic of the second part of Isaiah), it is worth noticing that it is found once in the Book of Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>), which, on Hitzig's theory, was written before the so called Second Isaiah. It still remains for the student to consider whether these two verses are not an insertion by some later hand (without attempting to discover whose that hand was). That the prophetic writings have received additions from editors and scribes is a fact which cannot reasonably be gainsaid, supported as it is by the phenomena of the historical books. It would be very natural for a pious Jew in the Captivity, not wholly devoid himself of the spirit of prophecy, to encourage his people, in the Name of the Lord, with this glowing word of promise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1441;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
