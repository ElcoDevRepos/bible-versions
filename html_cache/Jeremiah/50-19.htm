Historically, Israel faced exile due to disobedience, but God assures a return to their homeland. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where despite judgment, there is always hope for redemption. The imagery of a pasture suggests peace, provision, and security, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd caring for His flock.<p><b>and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan</b><br>Carmel and Bashan were regions known for their fertility and lush pastures. Carmel, a mountain range in northern Israel, was famous for its beauty and agricultural productivity (<a href="/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>). Bashan, located east of the Jordan River, was renowned for its rich pastures and strong cattle (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>). This promise indicates a return to abundance and prosperity, contrasting with the desolation experienced during exile.<p><b>his soul will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead</b><br>Ephraim and Gilead were significant regions in Israel's history. Ephraim, representing the northern kingdom, was often used symbolically for the entire nation of Israel. Gilead, east of the Jordan, was known for its balm, a healing ointment (<a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>). The satisfaction of the soul implies not just physical abundance but spiritual fulfillment and healing. This echoes the messianic hope found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1-2</a>, where God invites His people to find true satisfaction in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of God, the descendants of Jacob, who are often depicted as a flock in need of a shepherd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/carmel.htm">Carmel</a></b><br>A fertile region known for its lush pastures, symbolizing abundance and restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>Another region known for its rich pastures and strong cattle, representing strength and provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>A significant tribe of Israel, often representing the Northern Kingdom, known for its fruitful land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and healing properties, symbolizing restoration and healing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_promise_of_restoration.htm">God's Promise of Restoration</a></b><br>God is faithful to restore His people to a place of abundance and satisfaction.
