The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God's sovereignty over the armies of heaven and earth, underscoring His supreme command and control. This title is often used in contexts where God's power and authority are being asserted, especially in matters of judgment or deliverance. It reminds the audience that the message is not from Jeremiah himself but from God, who commands all forces in the universe.<p><b>the God of Israel</b><br>This designation highlights the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It serves as a reminder of the special bond and promises made to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;and the nation that descended from them. Despite Israel's disobedience, God remains their God, faithful to His covenant. This phrase also distinguishes the God of Israel from the gods of the surrounding nations, asserting His unique identity and authority.<p><b>to relay to their masters</b><br>This part of the verse indicates the intended recipients of the message&#8212;foreign kings and rulers. Jeremiah is instructed to communicate God's message through envoys to these leaders, showing that God's sovereignty extends beyond Israel to all nations. This reflects the biblical theme that God is not only the God of Israel but the God of all creation, who holds all nations accountable. The historical context involves the political dynamics of the time, where Judah and surrounding nations were under threat from Babylon. This message serves as a divine directive to these nations, indicating that their political and military strategies should align with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah and surrounding nations.
