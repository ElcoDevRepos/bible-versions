It reflects the biblical theme that God's timing is not bound by human expectations (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The phrase suggests that divine intervention can occur unexpectedly, aligning with the biblical narrative of God acting in history according to His purposes.<p><b>I might announce</b><br>The use of "announce" indicates a prophetic declaration. In the context of Jeremiah, prophets were often the mouthpieces of God, delivering His messages to the people. This aligns with the role of prophets throughout the Old Testament, such as Isaiah and Ezekiel, who conveyed God's warnings and promises.<p><b>that a nation or kingdom</b><br>This phrase highlights the scope of God's authority over all nations, not just Israel. It reflects the biblical understanding that God is the ruler of all the earth (<a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). Historically, this includes nations like Assyria and Babylon, which played significant roles in Israel's history. The mention of "nation or kingdom" underscores the universal application of God's judgment and mercy.<p><b>will be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed</b><br>These actions&#8212;uprooting, tearing down, and destroying&#8212;are metaphors for divine judgment. They reflect the agricultural and construction imagery common in the Bible, symbolizing the complete removal and dismantling of a nation's power and influence. This is consistent with other prophetic literature, such as the book of Daniel, where kingdoms rise and fall according to God's will. Theologically, it points to the ultimate judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom, as seen in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_potter's_house.htm">The Potter's House</a></b><br>The setting for the object lesson God gives to Jeremiah, illustrating His sovereignty over nations and individuals.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_kingdoms.htm">Nations and Kingdoms</a></b><br>Represents any political or social entity that God addresses through His prophetic messages.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who has authority over all nations and kingdoms, able to build up or tear down according to His will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jeremiah's prophecies, often warned of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God has ultimate authority over nations and their destinies.

Yet the very fact that He announces it first signals mercy, offering room for repentance.

He is now taught that that work was throughout conditional. In bold anthropomorphic speech Jehovah represents himself as changing His purpose, even suddenly, "in an instant," if the nation that is affected by it passes from evil to good or from good to evil. The seeming change is but the expression of an unchanged eternal Law of Righteousness, dealing with men according to their works.
