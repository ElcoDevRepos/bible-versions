Historically, Judah was a land rich in resources, including agricultural produce and trade goods. The wealth and treasures symbolize not only material possessions but also the spiritual blessings and heritage that the people of Judah had received from God. The loss of these treasures is a direct consequence of their disobedience and idolatry, reflecting the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>I will give up as plunder</b><br>The giving up of wealth as plunder indicates a divine judgment where God allows foreign nations to invade and take possession of Judah's riches. This is a fulfillment of the warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, where God uses other nations as instruments of His judgment. Historically, this was realized through invasions by the Babylonians, who looted Jerusalem and the temple, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24-25</a>.<p><b>without charge</b><br>This phrase suggests that the plundering will occur without any compensation or ransom. It emphasizes the totality of the loss and the inability of Judah to prevent or mitigate the consequences of their sins. The idea of "without charge" underscores the severity of God's judgment, as there is no bargaining or redemption price that can be paid to avert the disaster.<p><b>for all your sins</b><br>The sins of Judah, including idolatry, injustice, and breaking of the covenant, are the root cause of their impending judgment. The prophets repeatedly called the people to repentance, but their persistent rebellion led to this inevitable outcome. This phrase highlights the principle of divine retribution, where sin leads to judgment, as seen throughout the Old Testament narrative.<p><b>within all your borders</b><br>This indicates that the judgment will be comprehensive, affecting the entire land of Judah. The phrase "within all your borders" suggests that no part of the nation will be spared from the consequences of their actions. It reflects the thoroughness of God's judgment, as seen in the Babylonian conquest, which devastated the land and led to the exile of its people. This also serves as a reminder of the covenantal promise that the land was a gift from God, contingent upon their faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

What He once gave in grace, He may withdraw in justice, yet His purpose remains redemptive: to turn His people from treasuring gifts to treasuring Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Thy substance and thy treasures . . .</span>--Assuming the words to stand in their right place, we must look on them as addressed to Jeremiah as the intercessor, and therefore the representative, of his people. If we admit a dislocation, of which there seem many signs, we may connect them with <a href="/context/jeremiah/15-5.htm" title="For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan you? or who shall go aside to ask how you do?">Jeremiah 15:5-6</a>, and then they are spoken to Jerusalem. The recurrence of the words in <a href="/context/jeremiah/17-3.htm" title="O my mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your treasures to the spoil, and your high places for sin, throughout all your borders.">Jeremiah 17:3-4</a>, as addressed to the mountain of the plain, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Zion, makes this probable.<p><span class= "bld">Without price.</span>--As in <a href="/psalms/44-12.htm" title="You sell your people for nothing, and do not increase your wealth by their price.">Psalm 44:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-3.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, You have sold yourselves for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without money.">Isaiah 52:3</a>, this implies the extremest abandonment. The enemies of Israel were to have an easy victory, for which they would not have to pay the usual price of blood; nor did God, on His side, demand from them any payment for the victory He bestowed. He gave away His people as men give that which they count worthless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy substance</span>, etc. These verses form an unlooked-for digression. The prophet has been in a state of profound melancholy, and the object of Jehovah is to rouse him from it. In Vers. 11, 12, the most encouraging assurances have been given him. Suddenly comes the overwhelming declaration contained in Vers. 13, 14. And when we look closely at these verses, two points strike us, which make it difficult to conceive that Jeremiah intended them to stand here. First, their contents are not at all adapted to Jeremiah, and clearly belong to the people of Judah; and next, they are repeated, with some variations, in <a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3, 4</a>. It should also be observed that the Septuagint (which omits <a href="/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1-4</a>) only gives them here, which seems to indicate an early opinion that the passage only ought to occur once in the Book of Jeremiah, though the Septuagint translator failed to choose the right position for it. <span class="cmt_word">Without price;</span> literally, not for a price. In the parallel passage there is another reading, "thy high places," which forms part of the next clause. Hitzig and Graf suppose this to be the original reading, the Hebrew letters having been partly effaced and then misread, after which "not" was prefixed to make sense. However this may be, the present reading is unintelligible, if we compare <a href="/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>, where Jehovah declares that his people were sold for nothing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were given up entirely to the enemy, without any compensating advantage to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And that for all thy sins,</span> <span class="cmt_word">even</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">and in all thy sins and in all thy borders</span>. The text is certainly difficult. Externally a parallelism exists between the two halves of the clause, and one is therefore tempted to render literally. As this will not make sense, however, we are forced either to render as the Authorized Version, or to suppose that the text is not accurately preserved. The parallel passage has a different but not a more intelligible reading. Ewald omits "and" in both halves of the clause, which slightly diminishes the awkwardness. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make thee to pass</span>, etc. The natural rendering of the Hebrew is, "And I will make thine enemies to pass," etc., which clearly cannot be the prophet's meaning. The parallel passage (<a href="/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Jeremiah 17:4</a>) has, "And I will make thee to serve thine enemies," etc.; and so the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Targum, and many manuscripts here. <span class="cmt_word">For a fire is kindled in mine anger</span>;
