The "LORD of Hosts" refers to God as the commander of heavenly armies, emphasizing His power and sovereignty. The "God of Israel" highlights His covenant relationship with the nation of Israel, reminding the people of their unique bond and obligations to Him. This introduction sets the stage for a divine pronouncement, underscoring the seriousness of the message.<p><b>As for you and your wives,</b><br>This addresses both the men and women of Judah, indicating that the idolatrous practices were widespread and involved entire families. In the cultural context, family units often participated together in religious activities, whether true worship or idolatry. The inclusion of "wives" suggests that the women played a significant role in the worship of the Queen of Heaven, possibly influencing family and community religious practices.<p><b>you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands your words:</b><br>This highlights the people's deliberate and conscious decision to engage in idolatry. The phrase "spoken with your mouths" indicates a verbal commitment, while "fulfilled with your hands" suggests action and follow-through. This duality of speech and action reflects a complete and willful rebellion against God's commandments, as they not only vowed but also executed their idolatrous intentions.<p><b>&#8216;We will surely perform our vows that we have made to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.&#8217;</b><br>The "Queen of Heaven" is a reference to a pagan deity, likely associated with fertility and celestial bodies, such as the moon or stars. This idolatrous worship was a direct violation of the first commandment, which forbids the worship of other gods. The practice of burning incense and pouring out drink offerings were common rituals in ancient Near Eastern religions, signifying devotion and seeking favor from the deity. This reflects the syncretism that had infiltrated Judah, where the people mixed pagan practices with their worship of Yahweh.<p><b>Go ahead, then, do what you have promised! Keep your vows!</b><br>This statement is laden with irony and divine sarcasm. God is essentially telling the people to continue in their chosen path of disobedience, knowing it will lead to their destruction. It reflects the principle of divine judgment where God allows people to follow their sinful desires, leading to inevitable consequences. This echoes <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-28</a>, where God "gave them over" to their sinful ways. The call to "keep your vows" underscores the futility and danger of their rebellion, as their actions will not bring the desired blessings but rather divine wrath.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly armies, underscoring His authority to judge and command.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_god_of_israel.htm">The God of Israel</a></b><br>Highlights the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel, reminding them of their unique calling and responsibilities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah_in_egypt.htm">The People of Judah in Egypt</a></b><br>These are the Israelites who fled to Egypt after the fall of Jerusalem, continuing their idolatrous practices despite God's warnings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_queen_of_heaven.htm">The Queen of Heaven</a></b><br>A pagan deity worshiped by the Israelites, likely associated with fertility and celestial bodies, representing a direct violation of the first commandment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message, serving as a mouthpiece for divine judgment and calling the people back to faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.

By identifying Himself as &#8220;the LORD of Hosts,&#8221; He reminds the remnant in Egypt that<p>&#8226; He commands heaven&#8217;s armies (<a href="/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; His voice cannot be ignored (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; He has remained faithful to Israel despite their repeated rebellion (<a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>The title drives home that the warning to come is not Jeremiah&#8217;s opinion but divine, binding truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands your words</b><p>The Lord highlights personal responsibility: their lips and hands match in stubborn disobedience. Scripture consistently links spoken vows with accountable action (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>).<p>&#8226; They verbalized their intent.<p>&#8226; They actively carried it out.<p>This mirrors <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>&#8212;&#8220;Be doers of the word and not hearers only.&#8221; Here, tragically, they are &#8220;doers&#8221; of wickedness, proving their guilt beyond dispute.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;We will surely perform our vows that we have made to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.&#8217;</b><p>The &#8220;Queen of Heaven&#8221; was a fertility goddess venerated throughout the Near East (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>). In direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a>), the people pledged:<p>&#8226; Incense&#8212;symbolizing prayer and devotion&#8212;redirected from Yahweh to an idol.<p>&#8226; Drink offerings&#8212;meant for the true altar&#8212;lavished on a counterfeit deity.<p>Paul later exposes the spiritual reality behind such worship: &#8220;the things the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>). Their vows are not harmless cultural expressions; they are treason against the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go ahead, then, do what you have promised!

When hardened sinners insist on rebellion, divine justice may allow them to reap its full harvest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/44-25.htm">Jeremiah 44:25</a> confronts the exiled Judeans in Egypt with the stark reality that God takes their words and actions seriously. They have deliberately pledged loyalty to a false deity, and the Lord&#8212;who sees both mouth and hand&#8212;confirms their guilt. His ironic permission to &#8220;keep your vows&#8221; is not approval but a sentence: by persisting, they choose judgment over mercy. The verse warns every generation that vows matter, idolatry invites ruin, and the Almighty will not share His glory with another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With your hand;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with your hands. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Ye will surely accomplish</span>, etc.;
