Geruth Chimham is believed to be a lodging place or settlement associated with Chimham, the son of Barzillai the Gileadite, who was a supporter of King David (<a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37-40</a>). This location near Bethlehem suggests a temporary refuge, highlighting the instability and fear among the remnant of Judah after the Babylonian conquest. The choice of this location may reflect a strategic decision to stay close to a familiar and supportive area before making a significant journey.<p><b>near Bethlehem</b><br>Bethlehem, known as the City of David, holds significant historical and theological importance. It is the birthplace of King David and later, Jesus Christ (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>). Its mention here underscores the connection to Davidic heritage and the fulfillment of messianic prophecies. The proximity to Bethlehem may also symbolize a return to roots or a place of safety amidst turmoil, as Bethlehem was a well-known and established town in Judah.<p><b>in order to proceed into Egypt</b><br>This phrase reveals the intention of the group to seek refuge in Egypt, a common place of asylum throughout biblical history (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). Egypt represents a place of safety from immediate threats but also a place of spiritual and physical bondage, as seen in the Exodus narrative. The decision to go to Egypt reflects a lack of trust in God's promises to protect the remnant in the land of Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10-16</a>). This action foreshadows the recurring theme of reliance on foreign powers rather than on God, a theme prevalent in the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/johanan_son_of_kareah.htm">Johanan son of Kareah</a></b><br>A military leader who, along with other commanders, pursued Ishmael after he assassinated Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael_son_of_nethaniah.htm">Ishmael son of Nethaniah</a></b><br>The assassin of Gedaliah, who was appointed by the Babylonians as governor over the land of Judah.

Each phrase exposes a tension between God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness and human impulse to control outcomes. The verse prepares readers for Jeremiah&#8217;s forthcoming counsel: remain where God placed you, trust His protection, and resist the pull of old dependencies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">They departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham.</span>--The word translated "habitation "is not found elsewhere, but it is connected with one which means "stranger," "foreigner," and means probably a <span class= "ital">caravanserai, </span>or <span class= "ital">hospitium </span>for travellers. The name of Chimham throws us back on the history of Barzillai in <a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm" title="Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.">2Samuel 19:37</a>. When the Gileadite chief pleaded his age as a ground for not accepting David's invitation to live at his court, the offer was transferred to his son Chimham. On the king's death-bed he was specially commended to the care of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-7.htm" title="But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.">1Kings 2:7</a>). It seems probable that some part of David's personal patrimony, as distinct from his royal domains, had been bestowed on him, and that he had perpetuated his gratitude by erecting a resting-place for travellers, probably enough identical with the "inn" of the Nativity (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm" title="And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.">Luke 2:7</a>). The plan of the fugitives under Johanan took them to Bethlehem, as lying on the road to Egypt, where they hoped to find a refuge both from the anarchy in which the land had been left by the death of Gedaliah, and from the severe punishment which the Chaldaeans were likely to inflict, without too careful an inquiry into the question who had been guilty of it, for the murder of the ruler whom they had appointed. The mere fact of their having remained with Ishmael might be construed into circumstantial evidence of complicity. There they halt, and take counsel.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And dwelt in the habitation of Chimham.</span> Chimham was the son of the rich Gileadite Barzillai (<a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37-40</a>), who probably founded this "habitation" or rather "hospice" ("khan," "caravanserai"), for the accommodation of travellers - a characteristic mark of public-spirited liberality.
