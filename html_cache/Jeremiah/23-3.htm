The "remnant" refers to the faithful few who remain true to God despite widespread apostasy. This concept of a remnant is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a> and <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>. The imagery of a "flock" highlights God's role as a shepherd, a motif found throughout Scripture, notably in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd.<p><b>from all the lands to which I have banished them</b><br>This reflects the historical context of the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were scattered due to their disobedience. The phrase underscores God's sovereignty in both judgment and restoration. The dispersion of the Israelites is documented in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/36.htm">2 Chronicles 36</a>. The promise of regathering is a recurring prophetic theme, also seen in <a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a> and <a href="/zechariah/10-9.htm">Zechariah 10:9-10</a>, indicating God's faithfulness to His covenant.<p><b>and I will return them to their pasture</b><br>The "pasture" symbolizes a place of safety, provision, and peace, reminiscent of the Promised Land. This promise of return is not just physical but also spiritual, indicating a restoration of relationship with God. The imagery connects to <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>, where God leads His people to green pastures, and to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>, where the Lamb shepherds His people to springs of living water.<p><b>where they will be fruitful and multiply</b><br>This phrase echoes the original blessing given to humanity in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> and to the patriarchs, such as in <a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>. It signifies not only physical prosperity but also spiritual growth and the fulfillment of God's promises. The idea of fruitfulness is also a type of Christ, who in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, speaks of His followers bearing much fruit through abiding in Him. This promise of multiplication and blessing is a testament to God's redemptive plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant.htm">The Remnant</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful portion of God's people who remain after judgment and exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's people, often used to describe Israel in the Old Testament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lands_of_exile.htm">The Lands of Exile</a></b><br>The various nations where the Israelites were scattered due to their disobedience and subsequent exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pasture.htm">The Pasture</a></b><br>Symbolizes a place of safety, provision, and blessing where God intends to restore His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite Israel's disobedience, God promises to gather His people, demonstrating His unwavering faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_the_remnant.htm">The Importance of the Remnant</a></b><br>God often works through a faithful remnant, reminding us to remain steadfast in our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_hope.htm">Restoration and Hope</a></b><br>God's promise to return His people to their pasture offers hope for restoration and renewal in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fruitfulness_as_a_sign_of_blessing.htm">Fruitfulness as a Sign of Blessing</a></b><br>Being fruitful and multiplying is a sign of God's blessing and favor, encouraging us to seek spiritual growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_the_shepherd.htm">God as the Shepherd</a></b><br>Understanding God as our Shepherd provides comfort and assurance of His guidance and protection.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_23_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 23:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_23_3_God_s_restoration_promise.htm">How does Jeremiah 23:3 demonstrate God's promise to restore His people?
