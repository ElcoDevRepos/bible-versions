Horses and chariots were symbols of strength and warfare in ancient times, often representing a nation's ability to wage war and defend itself. The imagery of a sword against them indicates a decisive and overwhelming defeat. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God opposing the proud and powerful, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>, where reliance on horses and chariots is contrasted with trust in God.<p><b>and against all the foreigners in her midst</b><br>Babylon was a cosmopolitan empire, home to many foreigners due to its conquests and trade. This phrase suggests that not only the native Babylonians but also the foreign mercenaries and residents would face judgment. Historically, Babylon was known for its diverse population, which included people from various conquered lands. The inclusion of foreigners in this judgment underscores the totality of Babylon's downfall, as seen in other prophetic texts like <a href="/isaiah/13-15.htm">Isaiah 13:15-16</a>.<p><b>and they will become like women</b><br>In the cultural context of ancient times, this phrase implies a loss of courage and strength, as women were often stereotypically viewed as less capable in battle. This is not a commentary on gender but rather a reflection of the cultural perceptions of the time. The imagery is used to convey the idea of complete demoralization and helplessness in the face of divine judgment, similar to the descriptions found in <a href="/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>.<p><b>A sword is against her treasuries</b><br>Babylon was renowned for its wealth and opulence, with vast treasuries accumulated from its conquests and trade. The mention of a sword against these treasuries indicates that Babylon's economic power would also be destroyed. This reflects the biblical principle that material wealth cannot save a nation from divine judgment, as echoed in <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>, which states that riches do not profit in the day of wrath.<p><b>and they will be plundered</b><br>The plundering of Babylon's treasuries signifies the complete stripping away of its wealth and resources. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when the Medes and Persians conquered Babylon, as recorded in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>. The plundering serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly riches and the ultimate sovereignty of God over nations, a theme prevalent throughout the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The primary subject of <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50</a>, Babylon is the empire that conquered Judah and took the Israelites into exile.
