Historically, these officials were responsible for maintaining the covenant relationship with God and leading the people in adherence to the Law. Their failure to uphold justice and righteousness often led to national judgment. This context is crucial as it highlights the accountability of leaders in God's covenant community.<p><b>the court officials</b><br>These individuals were part of the royal administration, serving the king and managing the affairs of the state. Their inclusion signifies the widespread nature of the covenant violation, as even those closest to the king were implicated. This reflects the systemic corruption and unfaithfulness that had permeated the leadership structure.<p><b>the priests</b><br>The priests were responsible for the spiritual leadership of the nation, mediating between God and the people through sacrifices and temple services. Their involvement in the covenant breach underscores a profound spiritual failure, as they were meant to be the guardians of the covenant and the Law. This failure is reminiscent of other biblical instances where priestly corruption led to national decline, such as in the time of Eli (1 Samuel 2).<p><b>and all the people of the land</b><br>This phrase indicates that the covenant breach was not limited to the leaders but included the general populace. It suggests a collective responsibility and highlights the pervasive nature of the sin. The phrase "people of the land" often refers to the common citizens, emphasizing that the covenant was a communal agreement with God, not just a leadership obligation.<p><b>who passed between the pieces of the calf</b><br>This refers to an ancient covenant-making ritual, where parties would walk between the pieces of a sacrificed animal, symbolizing the seriousness of the covenant and the consequences of breaking it (<a href="/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9-10, 17</a>-18). The imagery here is stark, as it implies that those who broke the covenant would face the same fate as the divided animal. This act was a solemn oath, invoking divine witness and judgment upon failure to uphold the agreement. The ritual underscores the gravity of their unfaithfulness and the certainty of divine retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/officials_of_judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Officials of Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>These are the leaders and authorities in the southern kingdom of Judah, including those in the capital city, Jerusalem.
