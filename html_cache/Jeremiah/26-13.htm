In the context of Jeremiah's ministry, this was a common theme as he warned Judah of impending judgment due to their idolatry and disobedience. The call to "correct" implies a turning away from sin and a return to covenant faithfulness. This echoes the broader biblical theme of repentance found in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-17</a>, where God calls His people to turn from their wicked ways.<p><b>and obey the voice of the LORD your God</b><br>Obedience to God's voice is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The "voice of the LORD" often refers to the prophetic messages delivered by God's chosen messengers, like Jeremiah. This phrase underscores the importance of heeding divine instruction, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience. The call to obedience is a reminder of the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, emphasizing love and loyalty to God.<p><b>so that He might relent of the disaster</b><br>The possibility of God relenting from disaster highlights His mercy and willingness to forgive. This reflects the conditional nature of many of God's warnings, where judgment can be averted through genuine repentance. The concept of God relenting is seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>, where Nineveh's repentance leads to God sparing the city. It demonstrates God's desire for restoration rather than destruction.<p><b>He has pronounced against you</b><br>The disaster pronounced by God refers to the impending judgment on Judah for their persistent sin. This pronouncement is a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to communicate these divine decrees, serving as a mediator between God and the people. The historical context includes the Babylonian threat, which was the instrument of God's judgment, as seen in the eventual fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The summons is personal and timely&#8212;meant for right here, right now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Correct your ways and deeds</b><p>Repentance starts with turning around, not merely feeling regret. Jeremiah had already cried, &#8220;&#8216;Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Change the direction of your life&#8212;<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16&#8211;17</a> urges, &#8220;Remove your evil deeds&#8230; learn to do right.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Bear visible fruit&#8212;John the Baptist said, &#8220;Produce fruit in keeping with repentance&#8221; (<a href="/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognize that actions matter&#8212;<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> reminds us that &#8220;faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.&#8221;<p>The Lord calls for tangible reform: integrity in business, purity in relationships, justice toward the vulnerable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And obey the voice of the LORD your God</b><p>Hearing without doing is disobedience. <a href="/deuteronomy/30-2.htm">Deuteronomy 30:2</a> promises blessing when the people &#8220;return to the LORD&#8230; and obey His voice.&#8221; Samuel told Saul, &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). Jesus echoes the same principle: &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>). Obedience confirms that repentance is genuine. It is submission to God&#8217;s revealed will, not selective compliance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that He might relent of the disaster He has pronounced against you</b><p>God&#8217;s judgments are real, yet His heart inclines toward mercy. <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a> records that when Nineveh repented, &#8220;God relented of the disaster He had threatened.&#8221; <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a> affirms He is &#8220;gracious and compassionate&#8230; slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion, and He relents from sending disaster.&#8221; The principle holds in every era: <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a> ties national healing to humble repentance.

He had not denounced an irreversible doom. He had held out the assurance of pardon on repentance. He had threatened only to bring about repentance. The whole history reminds us of the accusation brought against One greater than Jeremiah. He had foretold a destruction of the Second Temple as complete as that of Shiloh (<a href="/luke/19-44.htm" title="And shall lay you even with the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone on another; because you knew not the time of your visitation.">Luke 19:44</a>).

And He, foreseeing that the people would not repent, had pronounced, though not publicly, a sentence on the Temple which succeeded that against which Jeremiah had prophesied, which was irrevocable (<a href="/matthew/24-2.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, See you not all these things? truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.">Matthew 24:2</a>;
