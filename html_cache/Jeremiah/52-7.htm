The breaching of the city walls signifies the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecies regarding the fall of Jerusalem due to the people's disobedience to God (<a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>). The breach represents a pivotal moment in biblical history, leading to the Babylonian exile.<p><b>and though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city,</b><br>The Chaldeans, synonymous with the Babylonians, were a dominant power in the ancient Near East. Their siege tactics were effective, as they encircled Jerusalem, cutting off supplies and weakening the city's defenses. This encirclement is a physical manifestation of God's judgment, as foretold by the prophets, including Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/32-28.htm">Jeremiah 32:28-29</a>).<p><b>all the men of war fled the city by night</b><br>The flight of the warriors indicates a desperate and strategic retreat, highlighting the dire situation within Jerusalem. This act of fleeing at night suggests an attempt to avoid detection, reflecting the fear and hopelessness among the defenders. It also underscores the fulfillment of prophecy, as Jeremiah had warned of the city's fall and the futility of resistance (<a href="/jeremiah/38-2.htm">Jeremiah 38:2-3</a>).<p><b>by way of the gate between the two walls near the king&#8217;s garden.</b><br>This specific location provides a geographical insight into the city's layout. The gate between the two walls likely refers to a secondary escape route, possibly near the southeastern part of Jerusalem. The king's garden, mentioned in other biblical texts (<a href="/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>), was likely a royal estate, indicating the proximity to the palace and the urgency of the escape.<p><b>They headed toward the Arabah,</b><br>The Arabah is a desert region south of the Dead Sea, extending to the Gulf of Aqaba. This direction suggests an attempt to flee towards the wilderness, possibly seeking refuge or regrouping. The choice of this route may reflect a strategic decision to avoid the main Babylonian forces. The Arabah's mention connects to the broader biblical theme of wilderness as a place of testing and refuge, seen in the journeys of figures like Moses and Elijah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City (Jerusalem)</a></b><br>The capital of Judah, Jerusalem was under siege by the Chaldeans (Babylonians) as a result of the people's disobedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans.htm">The Chaldeans (Babylonians)</a></b><br>The empire that besieged Jerusalem, led by King Nebuchadnezzar.
