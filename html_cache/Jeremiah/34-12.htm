Throughout the book of Jeremiah, the prophet frequently receives direct communication from God, emphasizing his role as a true prophet who speaks not from his own authority but from divine revelation. This underscores the authenticity and seriousness of the message that follows.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* Jeremiah was a prophet during a tumultuous period in Judah's history, around the late 7th and early 6th centuries BC. This was a time when the kingdom of Judah was under threat from the Babylonian Empire. The phrase indicates a specific instance where God is addressing the current situation in Judah, often involving themes of covenant faithfulness and impending judgment due to the people's disobedience.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* The phrase "the word of the LORD came" is a common prophetic formula found throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the books of the prophets (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1:1</a>). It signifies that the message is not of human origin but is divinely inspired. This formula establishes the authority of the prophetic message and aligns Jeremiah with other prophets who served as God's mouthpieces.<br><br>*Prophecy:* The phrase sets the stage for a prophetic announcement. In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/34.htm">Jeremiah 34</a>, the message pertains to the covenantal obligations of the people of Judah, specifically regarding the release of Hebrew slaves, which they had failed to uphold. This failure is a breach of the covenant made at Sinai, highlighting the people's persistent disobedience and the resulting consequences.<br><br>*Types of Jesus Christ:* While this specific phrase does not directly typify Christ, the broader context of Jeremiah's prophecies often points to themes of judgment and redemption, which are fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ. Jeremiah's role as a mediator between God and the people can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate mediation and fulfillment of the law and the prophets.<br><br>*Geographical and Archaeological Insights:* Jeremiah's ministry took place primarily in Jerusalem and the surrounding regions of Judah. Archaeological findings from this period, such as the Babylonian destruction layers in Jerusalem, corroborate the historical context of Jeremiah's prophecies and the socio-political upheaval during his time. These insights provide a tangible backdrop to the divine messages Jeremiah received and delivered.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

The leaders briefly obeyed God by freeing their Hebrew slaves (<a href="/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8-10</a>), but quickly reversed course (<a href="/jeremiah/34-11.htm">Jeremiah 34:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 12 signals God&#8217;s direct response to that breach of covenant, just as He had earlier confronted Judah&#8217;s kings for similar disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/22-1.htm">Jeremiah 22:1-5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The word of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Scripture stresses that what follows is not human opinion but divine revelation: &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8221;
