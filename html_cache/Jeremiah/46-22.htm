The serpent's hissing suggests fear and retreat, indicating Egypt's impending defeat and humiliation. Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation, often symbolized by the serpent in its iconography, such as the uraeus on the pharaoh's crown. This imagery connects to the broader biblical theme of God's judgment against nations that oppose His will, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>, where God punishes Leviathan, the fleeing serpent. The serpent's flight signifies Egypt's loss of power and influence, a reversal of its historical dominance.<p><b>for the enemy will advance in force</b><br>The advancing enemy refers to the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar, who historically invaded Egypt around 568-567 BC. This phrase underscores the inevitability and strength of the Babylonian forces, fulfilling God's judgment against Egypt. The advance in force highlights the overwhelming power and organized military strategy of Babylon, a common theme in the prophetic literature where God uses foreign nations as instruments of His judgment, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-11</a>. This also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and history.<p><b>with axes they will come against her</b><br>The imagery of axes suggests a methodical and destructive approach, akin to lumberjacks cutting down trees. This metaphor indicates the thoroughness and inevitability of Egypt's downfall. In ancient warfare, axes were used not only as weapons but also for breaking through defenses, symbolizing the complete dismantling of Egypt's power structures. This reflects the broader biblical theme of divine retribution, where God allows foreign powers to execute His judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>, where Assyria is described as an axe in God's hand.<p><b>like woodsmen cutting down trees</b><br>This simile emphasizes the systematic and relentless nature of the Babylonian invasion. Just as woodsmen methodically cut down trees, the Babylonians would dismantle Egypt's defenses and infrastructure. Trees often symbolize strength and stability in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the righteous are likened to a tree planted by streams of water. Here, the cutting down of trees symbolizes the removal of Egypt's strength and stability. This imagery also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and restoration themes found in the prophetic literature, where God promises to restore His people after a period of judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, where a shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this prophecy.

The nation that earlier compared itself to the mighty Nile crocodile (<a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>) now emits only a defensive, fearful sound.<p>&#8226; Scripture often links the serpent&#8217;s hiss with defeat or judgment (<a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>). Here, the hiss signals humiliation&#8212;no roar of the lion, just the urgent, nervous sound of retreat.<p>&#8226; God had already warned that trusting in worldly power brings shame (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>).

The once-boastful Egypt becomes a symbol of any power that stands against the Lord&#8212;silenced, overrun, and chopped down because &#8220;the LORD of Hosts is His name&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">The voice thereof shall go like a serpent.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">her voice</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the voice of Egypt. In early prophecies Egypt had been compared to a "dragon" or "serpent" (<a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm" title="In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm" title="Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old.

Here the serpent is represented as hissing in its rage and terror in the forest against which the enemies are advancing. The sign then gives way to the thing signified, and the latter clause of the verse brings before us the hosts of the Chaldaean allies, barbarous tribes like the Scythians, Massagetae, and Sacae, armed with axes instead of swords or spears (Herod. i. 275, iv. 5). They come, but it is to cut down the trees of the forest, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the symbols of the power of Egypt, and there is no power to resist them (<a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm" title="Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.">Isaiah 10:33</a>). The forest is so dense that the trees cannot be counted, but the fellers of the trees are as numerous, and the forest is destined to destruction at the hands of "the people of the north."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The voice thereof shall go like a serpent;</span> rather, <span class="accented">her voice is like</span> (<span class="accented">the sound of</span>) <span class="accented">a serpent gliding away.</span> Egypt (like Jerusalem, in <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>) is imagined as a maiden (comp. ver. 19) seated on the ground, and faintly sighing; and her feeble voice is likened to the rustling sound of a serpent in motion. <span class="cmt_word">Come against her with axes.</span> A sudden change of figure. Egypt, or, more strictly, Egypt's grandeur - its rich and complex national life, its splendid cities, its powerful army, all combined in one, is now compared to a forest (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6, 7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34</a>). It seems far fetched to suppose, with Graf and Dr. Payne Smith, that the comparison of the Chaldean warriors to wood cutters arose from their being armed with axes. It is probably true that the Israelites did not use the battle axe, but the axe is merely an accident of the description. It is the forest which suggests the mention of the axe, not the axe that of the forest, and forests were familiar enough to the Israelites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/46-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Egypt will hiss</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
