In the biblical context, the fear of the Lord is often associated with wisdom and obedience (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The rhetorical question highlights Israel's lack of proper reverence despite God's power and authority. Historically, the Israelites were surrounded by nations with various deities, yet they were called to recognize the LORD as the one true God. This call to fear God is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are reminded to work out their salvation with fear and trembling (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>).<p><b>Do you not tremble before Me,</b><br>Trembling before God signifies a deep recognition of His holiness and majesty. This reaction is seen throughout Scripture when individuals encounter God's presence, such as Isaiah's vision in the temple (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>) or John's vision in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). The trembling is not just physical but a profound spiritual response to God's overwhelming presence and power.<p><b>the One who set the sand as the boundary for the sea,</b><br>This phrase refers to God's sovereign control over creation, reminiscent of the creation account in Genesis. The imagery of setting boundaries for the sea is also found in <a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8-11</a>, where God questions Job about the limits He placed on the ocean. This demonstrates God's authority over nature, contrasting with ancient Near Eastern myths where gods struggled with chaotic waters. It underscores God's order and power in creation.<p><b>an enduring barrier it cannot cross?</b><br>The enduring barrier signifies God's unchanging and faithful nature. Despite the chaos and unpredictability of the sea, God's decrees remain firm. This reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and the reliability of His promises (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>). The sea, often a symbol of chaos and danger, is kept in check by God's command, illustrating His control over all things.<p><b>The waves surge, but they cannot prevail.</b><br>This imagery of surging waves that cannot prevail highlights God's omnipotence. In biblical literature, the sea often symbolizes chaos and opposition (<a href="/psalms/93-3.htm">Psalm 93:3-4</a>). Yet, God's power ensures that even the most tumultuous forces cannot overcome His established order. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who calms the storm in the Gospels (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>), demonstrating His divine authority over nature.<p><b>They roar but cannot cross it.</b><br>The roaring of the waves symbolizes the persistent challenges and threats that may arise, yet they are ultimately subdued by God's command. This reflects the biblical assurance that no matter how formidable the opposition, God's purposes will stand (<a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>). The imagery reassures believers of God's protection and sovereignty, encouraging trust in His unassailable power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Jeremiah, reminding His people of His power and authority over creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_and_sand.htm">The Sea and Sand</a></b><br>Symbolic elements used by God to illustrate His sovereign control over creation, representing His power to set boundaries that nature cannot transgress.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, to whom Jeremiah's prophecies were primarily directed, warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_waves.htm">The Waves</a></b><br>Representing the forces of nature that, despite their power, are subject to the boundaries set by God, illustrating His supreme authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_sovereignty.htm">Reverence for God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize and revere God's supreme authority over all creation.
