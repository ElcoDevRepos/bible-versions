At that time:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s timetable moves from promise to reality.<p>&#8226; Jerusalem becomes the recognized, literal throne of the LORD.<p>&#8226; Every nation willingly gathers there to honor His name.<p>&#8226; Renewed hearts replace stubborn hearts, fulfilling the New Covenant.<p>The verse invites confidence that God will keep every promise&#8212;to Israel, to the nations, and to all who embrace His redemptive plan in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">They shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord.</span>--Up to Jeremiah's time that title, "the throne of God," though the language of the Old Testament had referred it to the "heavens" (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm" title="The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm" title="The LORD has prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over all.">Psalm 103:19</a>), had probably been applied, in popular language, to the ark where the Lord "dwelt between the cherubim" (<a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm" title="So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.">1Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm" title="And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwell between the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.">2Kings 19:15</a>). The prophet extends it to the whole city, in that future of which he was doubtless thinking. To him, as to Micah (<a href="/context/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-2</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/context/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1-3</a>), there came a vision of the holy city as the centre of the divine Kingdom. It was not given to him to see what even the Apostles were slow to understand, that there is no holy city upon earth, and that his hopes would only be fulfilled in the heavenly Jerusalem which is the Church or family of God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Jerusalem's spiritual glory</span>. With Jeremiah's description, comp. that of Ezekiel," The name of the city from that day shall be, "The Lord is there" (<a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>). This gives us the positive aspect of the Messianic period (comp. on ver. 16). Jerusalem shall be the spiritual center of the universe, because it is pervaded by the presence of the Most High (comp. <a href="/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>). May we explain with Dr. Payne Smith, "Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Christian Church?" Only if the provisional character of the existing Church be kept well in view. <span class="cmt_word">All the nations</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. all except the chosen people. The word for "nations" (<span class="accented">goyim</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> that often rendered "heathen." <span class="cmt_word">To the name</span>; or, <span class="accented">because of the name</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. because Jehovah has revealed his name at Jerusalem. The phrase occurs again with a commentary in <a href="/joshua/9-9.htm">Joshua 9:9</a>, "Thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt." But we must not suppose that "name" is equivalent to "revelation;" rather, there is here an ellipsis - "because of the name" is equivalent to "because of the revelation of the <span class="accented">name</span>," or better still, "... of the <span class="accented">Name</span>." The "Name of Jehovah" <span class="accented">is</span> in fact a distinct hypostasis in the Divine Being; no mere personification of the Divine attributes (as the commentators are fond of saying), but (in the theological sense) a Person. The term, "Name of such and such a God,:' is common to Hebrew with Phoenician religion. In the famous inscription of Eshmunazar, King of Zidon, Ashtoreth is called "Name of Baal;" and to whichever proper name the religious term Name may be attached, it means a personal existence in the Divine nature, specially related to the world of humanity; or, to use the language of Hengstenberg, the bridge between the latter and the transcendent heights of God as he is in himself. In short, the Name of Jehovah is virtually identical with the Logos of St. John, or the second Person in the blessed Trinity. Hence the personal language now and again used of this Name in the Old Testament, e.g. <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>, "The Name of Jehovah <span class="accented">cometh</span> from far... <span class="accented">his lips</span> are full of indignation;" <a href="/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>," The desire of our soul was to thy Name;" <a href="/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>, "So shall they fear the Name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun." Comp. also <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>; men do not run for safety to an abstract idea. Nor will all nations in the latter days resort either to a localized or to a spiritually diffused Jerusalem in the future, to gratify a refined intellectual curiosity. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall they walk</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Israelites of the latter days; not the "nations" before mentioned (as Hengstenberg). The phrase occurs eight times in Jeremiah, and is always used of the Israelites. The word rendered "imagination" is peculiar (<span class="accented">sheri-ruth</span>). As Hengstenberg has pointed out, it occurs <span class="accented">independently</span> only in a single passage (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>); for in <a href="/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a>, it is plainly derived, not from the living language, from which it had disappeared, but from the written. (The close phraseological affinity between the Books of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah has been already indicated.) The rendering of the Authorized Version, which is supported by the Septuagint, Peshito, Targum, is certainly wrong; the Vulgate has <span class="accented">pravitatum</span>; the etymological meaning is "stubbornness." The error of the versions may perhaps have arisen out of a faulty inference from <a href="/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a>, where it stands in parallelism to "their counsels." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
