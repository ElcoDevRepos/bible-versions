The term "Ethiopian" refers to a person from Cush, a region south of Egypt, known for its dark-skinned inhabitants. In biblical times, Cushites were recognized for their distinct appearance, which was unchangeable. This serves as a metaphor for the deeply ingrained sinful nature of humanity. The Bible often uses physical characteristics to symbolize spiritual truths, emphasizing that just as a person cannot alter their skin color, so too is it impossible for humans to change their sinful nature without divine intervention.<p><b>or the leopard his spots?</b><br>The leopard's spots are another metaphor for something that is innate and unchangeable. In the ancient Near East, leopards were known for their distinctive and unalterable markings. This imagery reinforces the idea of the permanence of one's nature. The use of animals in biblical literature often conveys moral or spiritual lessons, and here it underscores the futility of attempting to change one's inherent tendencies through human effort alone. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18-19</a>, where Paul discusses the struggle against sin.<p><b>Neither are you able to do good&#8212;</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the moral incapacity of the people to perform good deeds on their own. It reflects the biblical teaching of the fallen state of humanity, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>, which declare that no one is righteous. The inability to do good is not just a matter of choice but of nature, emphasizing the need for a transformation that only God can provide. This aligns with the doctrine of original sin, which posits that all humans are born with a sinful nature inherited from Adam.<p><b>you who are accustomed to doing evil.</b><br>The phrase "accustomed to doing evil" suggests a habitual practice of sinning, indicating that the people have become so entrenched in their sinful ways that it has become second nature. This reflects the cultural and historical context of Judah during Jeremiah's time, where idolatry and moral corruption were rampant. The prophetic ministry of Jeremiah often called out the persistent disobedience of the people, urging them to repent. This habitual sinfulness points to the need for a new heart and spirit, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, which foreshadows the transformative work of Christ in the New Covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethiopian.htm">Ethiopian</a></b><br>Refers to a person from Cush, a region south of Egypt, known for its dark-skinned inhabitants.

The evil of Judah was too deep-ingrained to be capable of spontaneous reformation. There remained nothing but the sharp discipline of the exile. The invasion of Tirhakah and Pharaoh-nechoh, the presence of Ethiopians among the servants of the royal household (<a href="/jeremiah/38-10.htm" title="Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.">Jeremiah 38:10</a>), the intercourse with the upper valley of the Nile implied in <a href="/zephaniah/3-10.htm" title="From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.">Zephaniah 3:10</a> and <a href="/psalms/68-31.htm" title="Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.">Psalm 68:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm" title="I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.">Psalm 87:4</a>, had made the swarthy forms of Africa familiar objects. Possibly the use of leopard-skins by Ethiopian princes and warriors, as seen on Egyptian monuments and described by Herodotus (vii. 69), had associated the two thoughts together in the prophet's mind. If the king's household were present (as in <a href="/jeremiah/13-18.htm" title="Say to the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.">Jeremiah 13:18</a>), he may have pointed to such an one, Ebedmelech (<a href="/jeremiah/38-10.htm" title="Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.">Jeremiah 38:10</a>), or another so arrayed, in illustration of his words. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Can the Ethiopian</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#363;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3569.htm">Strong's 3569: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cushite -- descendant of Cush</span><br /><br /><span class="word">change</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1497;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1508;&#1465;&#1444;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;ya&#183;ha&#774;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2015.htm">Strong's 2015: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn about, over, to change, overturn, return, pervert</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his skin,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
