This period is characterized by colder weather in the region of Judah, necessitating the use of winter quarters. The timing is significant as it reflects the urgency of the message from God through Jeremiah, delivered during a time when people would be indoors and more likely to gather around for warmth and discussion. This month is also associated with the festival of Hanukkah, though it was not celebrated during Jeremiah's time.<p><b>the king was sitting in his winter quarters</b><br>The king referred to here is Jehoiakim, who reigned over Judah from 609 to 598 BC. Winter quarters were likely a part of the palace designed to provide warmth and comfort during the colder months. This setting indicates a place of relative security and comfort, contrasting with the dire warnings of Jeremiah. The mention of the king's winter quarters highlights the disconnect between the king's physical comfort and the spiritual and political turmoil facing the nation.<p><b>with a fire burning before him</b><br>The fire symbolizes warmth and light, essential for survival during the cold months. In a broader biblical context, fire often represents God's presence, judgment, or purification (e.g., <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). Here, the fire is a literal source of heat, but it also serves as a backdrop to the unfolding drama of the king's rejection of God's word. The fire's presence underscores the irony of the king's physical warmth and security while he is spiritually cold and unresponsive to God's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jehoiakim.htm">King Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during the time of Jeremiah.

The verse simply reports the literal time, yet it also underscores urgency; Jeremiah&#8217;s prophetic scroll had been read publicly earlier that same month during a day of fasting (<a href="/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Weather matters here: Israel&#8217;s winter chill drives people indoors, so when Jehoiakim later tosses the scroll into the flames (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>), we recognize he is not reacting in a moment of heat&#8208;of&#8208;battle chaos but in calculated comfort.<p>&#8226; Other winter references reinforce the reality of seasonal quarters&#8212;<a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a> speaks of &#8220;winter houses&#8221; destroyed in judgment, a warning Jehoiakim ignores.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king was sitting</b><p>&#8226; Jehoiakim&#8217;s relaxed posture contrasts sharply with the weight of God&#8217;s word being read to him. Kings normally rise to honor a message (<a href="/judges/3-20.htm">Judges 3:20</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-28.htm">2 Samuel 18:28</a>), yet Jehoiakim stays seated, foreshadowing his contemptuous response.<p>&#8226; His position signals authority but also detachment from his people&#8217;s suffering under Babylon&#8217;s threat (<a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>). Instead of leading in repentance, he lounges.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5</a> describes Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign as one that &#8220;did evil in the sight of the LORD,&#8221; and his bodily posture mirrors his spiritual state&#8212;self-assured, unmoved by divine warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in his winter quarters</b><p>&#8226; Winter quarters (or &#8220;winter house&#8221;) were private, well-insulated rooms sometimes lined with stone or plaster and equipped with heating implements. This detail roots the narrative in physical reality and highlights royal privilege.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah had earlier condemned rulers who built luxurious dwellings while neglecting justice (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-15</a>). Jehoiakim hears that very prophet&#8217;s scroll while enjoying the comfort those injustices provided.<p>&#8226; The setting reminds us of the contrast between God&#8217;s messenger Baruch, faithfully delivering the scroll despite personal risk (<a href="/jeremiah/36-19.htm">Jeremiah 36:19</a>), and the king, shielded by walls yet exposed spiritually.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a fire burning before him</b><p>&#8226; The brazier serves a practical purpose&#8212;warmth&#8212;yet also prepares the stage for sin. Moments later, &#8220;whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a scribe&#8217;s knife and throw them into the fire&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Fire, throughout Scripture, symbolizes both purification and judgment. Here it becomes the tool of deliberate rebellion (<a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a> contrasts God&#8217;s pure words with dross consumed by fire).<p>&#8226; Instead of letting the word burn in his heart like the disciples on the road to Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>), Jehoiakim uses literal flames to silence it. Yet <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a> assures, &#8220;The word of our God stands forever,&#8221; a truth God quickly demonstrates by commanding Jeremiah to rewrite the scroll (<a href="/jeremiah/36-28.htm">Jeremiah 36:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot: a cold ninth-month evening, a complacent king seated in his warm winter room, and a comforting fire crackling before him. Every detail heightens the contrast between the cozy security of human power and the uncompromising authority of God&#8217;s word. Jehoiakim&#8217;s surroundings reveal his heart&#8212;self-satisfied, unmoved, and soon to be judged&#8212;while simultaneously affirming that no royal comfort or blazing hearth can extinguish divine truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month.</span>--The "winterhouse" (the palaces of kings seem to have been commonly provided with such a special apartment; comp. <a href="/amos/3-15.htm" title="And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, said the LORD.">Amos 3:15</a>) was probably the southern wing of the palace. It was in November or December, and, as glass windows were unknown, a charcoal fire, placed after the Eastern fashion in a brazier, or earthen pot, in the middle of the room, was a necessity. So we find a fire in the court of the high priest's palace in the raw early morning of a Passover in March or April (<a href="/john/18-18.htm" title="And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.">John 18:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the winter house;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that part of the royal palace (<span class="accented">beth</span>, house, may also be rendered <span class="accented">apartment</span>) which was arranged for a winter habitation (comp. <a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>).
