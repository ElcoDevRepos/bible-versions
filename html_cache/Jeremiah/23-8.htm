Previously, the exodus from Egypt was the primary reference point for God's saving acts. This change signifies a new, significant event in Israel's history that will surpass the former exodus in its impact and importance.<p><b>&#8216;As surely as the LORD lives,</b><br>This oath formula underscores the certainty and truth of God's actions.

The return from Babylonian exile is seen as a second exodus, emphasizing God's continued faithfulness to His covenant people.<p><b>and all the other lands to which He had banished them.&#8217;</b><br>This expands the scope of God's deliverance beyond Babylon, acknowledging the dispersion of Israelites to various nations.

It fulfills prophecies of return and restoration found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24-28</a>.
