In the biblical context, the stork's ability to discern the times and seasons is a natural instinct given by God. This highlights the order and wisdom in creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. The stork's migration is a metaphor for understanding and obedience to God's timing and purposes, contrasting with the spiritual ignorance of the people of Judah.<p><b>The turtledove, the swift, and the thrush keep their time of migration,</b><br>These birds, like the stork, are known for their migratory habits. The turtledove is often associated with peace and is mentioned in <a href="/songs/2-12.htm">Song of Solomon 2:12</a> as a sign of spring. The swift and the thrush are also migratory, emphasizing the natural world's adherence to God's ordained cycles. This serves as a rebuke to the people of Judah, who fail to recognize and follow God's laws and timing, despite the clear example set by nature.<p><b>but My people do not know the requirements of the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the spiritual blindness and disobedience of the people of Judah. Despite having the Law and the prophets, they fail to understand and live by God's commandments. This ignorance is not due to a lack of information but a willful rejection of God's guidance, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where God laments that His people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. The contrast with the birds highlights the irony that creatures without the capacity for reason follow God's order, while His chosen people do not. This failure to know God's requirements foreshadows the coming judgment and exile, yet also points to the need for a Savior who perfectly fulfills God's law, as seen in the life and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The birds of the air obey their instincts as the law of their nature. Israel, with its fatal gift of freedom, resists that which is its law of life. The stork arrives in Palestine in March, and leaves for the north of Europe in April or May. The Hebrew name, <span class= "ital">chasideh </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">the pious bird</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>indicating its care for its young, is suggestive, as also is the phrase "in the heavens," as applied to its characteristic mode of flight. The turtle-dove appears at the approach of spring (Song <a href="/songs/2-12.htm" title="The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;">Song of Solomon 2:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The crane and the swallow.</span>--In the judgment of Tristram and other modern naturalists, the words should change places, and perhaps "swift" take the place of swallow. The word for "swallow" in <a href="/psalms/84-3.htm" title="Yes, the sparrow has found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.">Psalm 84:3</a> is different. The same combination meets us in <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm" title="Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: my eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.">Isaiah 38:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Judgment.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">ordinance, </span>the appointed rule of life which brute creatures obey and man transgresses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The appeal to the regularity of animal instincts reminds us of <a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>. Yea, the stork, etc. The minatory birds obey their instinct with the most unfailing regularity. Those referred to are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the stork, whose "regular and sudden return is one of the most interesting natural sights of Palestine. The expression 'stork in the heavens' refers to the immense height at which they fly during migration" (Tristram); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the turtle, or turtle-dove, whose return is the sure sign of spring (<a href="/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(3 and 4)</span> the crane and the swallow, or rather, "the swift and the crane." These birds are again mentioned together in <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> (the psalm of Hezekiah), where special reference is made to the penetrating quality of their note. "The whooping or trumpeting of the crane rings through the night air in spring, and the vast flocks which we noticed passing north near Beersheba were a wonderful sight." The introduction of the swallow in the Authorized Version is misleading, as that bird is not a regular migrant in Palestine. The note of the swift is a shrill scream. "No bird is more conspicuous by the suddenness of its return than the swift," is the remark of Canon Tristram, who saw large flocks passing northwards over Jerusalem, on the 12th of February ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 208). It is an interesting fact that the swift bears the same name (<span class="accented">sus</span>) in the vernacular Arabic as in the Hebrew of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_word">The judgment</span>; better, <span class="accented">the law</span> (see on Jeremiah 5:4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(gam-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the stork</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;s&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2624.htm">Strong's 2624: </a> </span><span class="str2">The kind, bird, a stork</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the sky</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;a&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
