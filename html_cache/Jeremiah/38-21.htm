The historical context is the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, which took place around 586 BC. Jeremiah, the prophet, is urging Zedekiah to surrender to the Babylonians to save the city and his own life. The refusal to surrender would lead to dire consequences, as previously prophesied by Jeremiah. This reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's will, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience.<p><b>this is the word that the LORD has shown me:</b><br>Jeremiah emphasizes that his message is not of his own making but a revelation from God. This underscores the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, delivering divine messages to His people. The phrase "the LORD has shown me" indicates a vision or direct communication from God, a common occurrence in the prophetic books. This aligns with <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, which states that God reveals His plans to His prophets.
