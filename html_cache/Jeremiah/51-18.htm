In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>, God is pronouncing judgment on Babylon, a nation known for its idolatry. The Hebrew word for "worthless" can also mean "vanity" or "emptiness," emphasizing the futility of worshiping anything other than the one true God. This echoes the theme found in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where idols are described as nothing and those who worship them are deluded. The worthlessness of idols is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting the contrast between the living God and lifeless images.<p><b>a work to be mocked</b><br>Idols are described as the work of human hands, crafted by artisans but lacking any divine power or life. This phrase suggests that such creations are deserving of ridicule because they cannot save or help their worshipers. The mocking of idols is a common biblical motif, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>, where Elijah mocks the prophets of Baal. The futility of idol worship is underscored by the fact that these objects are mere human creations, incapable of responding to prayer or providing guidance.<p><b>In the time of their punishment</b><br>This refers to the impending judgment that God will bring upon Babylon. The "time of their punishment" is a prophetic declaration of Babylon's downfall, which is a central theme in <a href="/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50-51</a>. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when the Medes and Persians conquered Babylon in 539 BC. The phrase indicates that there is an appointed time for divine retribution, aligning with the biblical principle that God is just and will not allow wickedness to go unpunished indefinitely.<p><b>they will perish</b><br>The ultimate fate of the idols and those who trust in them is destruction. This phrase underscores the transient nature of both idols and the empires that rely on them. In a broader theological context, it serves as a warning that anything set against God will ultimately fail. This is consistent with the biblical narrative that emphasizes the sovereignty of God over all nations and the futility of opposing His will. The perishing of idols also points to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon is symbolically destroyed, representing the final defeat of all that stands against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and other nations, including Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire during Jeremiah's time, Babylon is often depicted as a symbol of human pride and idolatry.

Scripture repeatedly states that man-made gods have no substance, no power, no life:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a> says, &#8220;Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands&#8230; Those who make them become like them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a> calls idol-makers &#8220;all nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a> reinforces, &#8220;We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world.&#8221;<p>Because God alone is Creator, anything fashioned by human hands and set up as divine is empty. &#8220;Worthless&#8221; is not hyperbole; it is a sober, literal assessment of idols&#8217; total inability to save, guide, or bless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a work to be mocked</b><p>Idols deserve ridicule because they are products of human skill pretending to be gods:<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19-20</a> pictures craftsmen overlaying statues with gold and securing them so &#8220;it will not topple,&#8221; exposing their fragility.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/10-15.htm">Jeremiah 10:15</a> repeats our verse word for word, emphasizing that every idol, no matter how ornate, is &#8220;a work to be mocked.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/19-26.htm">Acts 19:26</a> records the silversmiths&#8217; uproar when Paul proclaimed &#8220;gods made by human hands are not gods at all.&#8221;<p>Mockery here is not cruel humor but righteous exposure of false worship. By calling idols laughable, God invites people to turn from deception to truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the time of their punishment</b><p>There is a fixed moment when God&#8217;s patience ends and judgment falls.

Eternal destiny hinges on worshiping the living God, not lifeless substitutes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/51-18.htm">Jeremiah 51:18</a> delivers a four-fold declaration: idols are worthless, laughable, doomed at the appointed hour, and destined to vanish. The verse exposes the futility of trusting anything fashioned by human hands, while affirming God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty and the certainty of His judgment.
