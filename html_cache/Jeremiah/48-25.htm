Moab, a nation descended from Lot, was historically an enemy of Israel. The cutting off of Moab's horn signifies the loss of its power and influence. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where the horn symbolizes authority (e.g., <a href="/psalms/75-10.htm">Psalm 75:10</a>). The judgment against Moab is part of a broader prophetic declaration against nations that opposed Israel, reflecting God's sovereignty over all nations.<p><b>and his arm is broken</b><br>The "arm" symbolizes strength and the ability to act or exert power. Breaking the arm of Moab indicates a crippling of its military and political power. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture to denote the weakening of a nation or individual (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/30-21.htm">Ezekiel 30:21-22</a>). Historically, Moab was known for its fortified cities and military prowess, but this prophecy foretells its downfall and inability to defend itself against invaders, likely the Babylonians.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine authority behind the prophecy. It is not merely a human prediction but a declaration from God Himself. The use of "declares the LORD" underscores the certainty and inevitability of the prophecy's fulfillment. Throughout the Bible, when God declares something, it is a statement of His will and purpose, which will come to pass (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). This serves as a reminder of God's control over history and His ability to bring about His plans for nations and individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.
