In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet is addressing the false prophets and corrupt leaders of Judah who have led the people astray. The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with divine justice and righteousness. It reflects God's response to sin and rebellion, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/29-27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27-28</a> and <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>. The idea of God's anger not turning back until His purposes are fulfilled underscores His sovereignty and the seriousness of His covenant with Israel.<p><b>until He has fully accomplished the purposes of His heart</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's intentionality and determination. The "purposes of His heart" refer to God's divine plan and will, which are ultimately for the good of His people, even if they involve judgment. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God's plans are always fulfilled, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a> and <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>. The phrase suggests that God's actions are not arbitrary but are part of a larger redemptive plan, which includes both judgment and restoration.<p><b>In the days to come you will understand this clearly</b><br>This prophetic statement points to a future time when the people will recognize and comprehend God's actions and purposes. It implies that current events may be confusing or misunderstood, but clarity will come with time. This future understanding is a common theme in prophetic literature, where immediate events are often seen as part of a larger eschatological framework. The phrase can be connected to the New Testament, where the full revelation of God's plan is seen in Jesus Christ, as in <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9-10</a>. It also suggests a future hope and the eventual vindication of God's justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel.

The prophet's interpretation of the image. It is the judicial anger of Jehovah, personified as Divine manifestations so often are (hence "shall not return").

It seems better to restrict the term "latter days" to the Messianic period ("the coming age," <a href="/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>), to which, in fact, it is often applied (e.g. <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). The phrase in itself simply means "in the sequel of the days," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the future; its Messianic reference, when this exists, is inferred solely from the context. In the passage before us, and in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30, 30</a>:29, there can be no intention of pointing to the Messianic age. Precisely the same phrase occurs in an Assyrian inscription, where its meaning is clear from the context (<span class="accented">aria akhrat yumi irib</span>, "For a sequel of days - i.e., for a future time - I deposited"). In the present case it is no distant period to which the prophet refers, for he continues, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall consider it</span>, etc., or rather, <span class="accented">ye shall understand it clearly</span>, viz. that the calamities which will have come upon you are the Divine judgment upon your sins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/23-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The anger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_639.htm">Strong's 639: </a> </span><span class="str2">The nose, nostril, the face, a person, ire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">diminish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He has fully accomplished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1465;&#1514;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124;
