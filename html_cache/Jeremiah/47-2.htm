In the prophetic books, such declarations often signal a direct communication from God, underscoring the seriousness of the forthcoming message. It reflects the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, delivering His words to the people.<p><b>See how the waters are rising from the north and becoming an overflowing torrent:</b><br>The imagery of rising waters symbolizes an impending invasion or disaster. In the context of Jeremiah, the "north" often refers to Babylon, which was a dominant power threatening Judah and its neighbors. The metaphor of an "overflowing torrent" suggests a force that is unstoppable and destructive, much like the Babylonian army. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where water represents chaos and judgment (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>).<p><b>They will overflow the land and its fullness, the cities and their inhabitants:</b><br>This phrase indicates the totality of the coming devastation. The "land and its fullness" suggests that the judgment will affect every aspect of life, including agriculture, economy, and society. The mention of "cities and their inhabitants" highlights the widespread impact on both urban centers and their populations. This comprehensive destruction is reminiscent of other prophetic warnings, such as those found in Isaiah and Ezekiel, where entire nations face divine judgment.<p><b>The people will cry out, and all who dwell in the land will wail:</b><br>The response of the people&#8212;crying out and wailing&#8212;reflects the intense suffering and despair that will accompany the judgment. This reaction is typical in biblical descriptions of calamity, where the emotional and physical toll on the population is profound. The language here echoes other prophetic texts, such as Lamentations, where the consequences of divine judgment lead to mourning and lamentation. The wailing signifies not only physical distress but also a recognition of the spiritual and moral failures that led to such judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates His will and judgments through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/waters_from_the_north.htm">Waters from the North</a></b><br>Symbolic of an invading force, often interpreted as the Babylonians, who were known to come from the north to conquer lands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to Philistia, the region inhabited by the Philistines, who were historical enemies of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cities.htm">The Cities</a></b><br>The urban centers within Philistia that would be affected by the invasion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Philistia who would suffer the consequences of the invasion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>The passage highlights God's control over nations and His use of them to execute judgment.

If Necho conquered Gaza at the period supposed, it would be on his way to Carchemish, and not on his return. Besides," the north" is the standing symbol for the home of the dreaded Assyrian and Babylonian foes (see on Jeremiah 1:14).
