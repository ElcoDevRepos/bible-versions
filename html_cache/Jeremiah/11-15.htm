The term "My house" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place where God's presence dwelt. The rhetorical question underscores the incongruity of the people's presence in the temple given their unfaithfulness. This echoes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where Israel is often depicted as God's bride (<a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>). The use of "beloved" indicates a relationship that has been violated by idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>having carried out so many evil schemes?</b><br>The "evil schemes" refer to the idolatry and social injustices that the people of Judah were committing. Historically, this period was marked by widespread worship of Baal and other Canaanite deities, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The people were engaging in practices that were abominable to God, including child sacrifice and other pagan rituals (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). This phrase highlights the hypocrisy of the people who, despite their wickedness, still sought to participate in temple worship.<p><b>Can consecrated meat avert your doom?</b><br>"Consecrated meat" refers to the sacrificial offerings made in the temple. In the Old Testament sacrificial system, offerings were a means of atonement and worship (Leviticus 1-7). However, God is emphasizing that ritual sacrifices are meaningless without genuine repentance and obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). This rhetorical question points to the futility of relying on religious rituals to escape judgment when the heart remains unrepentant. It foreshadows the New Testament teaching that true worship is in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<p><b>When you are wicked, then you rejoice.</b><br>This phrase captures the moral corruption of the people, who not only commit wicked acts but also take pleasure in them. It reflects a hardened heart and a seared conscience, where sin is celebrated rather than mourned. This rejoicing in wickedness is condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/2-14.htm">Proverbs 2:14</a>, <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>). It contrasts with the call to mourn over sin and seek God's mercy (<a href="/james/4-9.htm">James 4:9</a>). The rejoicing in wickedness is a sign of impending judgment, as it indicates a complete turning away from God's righteous standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

A religion of mere ritual-sacrifices and the like will not avail to save. The Hebrew for "lewdness" does not convey the idea which we now attach to the English word, but means primarily a plan of any kind, and then a "device" or "scheme" in a bad sense, as in <a href="/psalms/10-2.htm" title="The wicked in his pride does persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.">Psalm 10:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/21-11.htm" title="For they intended evil against you: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.">Psalm 21:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-17.htm" title="He that is soon angry deals foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.">Proverbs 14:17</a>. Probably the translators, here, as in <a href="/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>; <a href="/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14</a>, used the word in this more general sense. Primarily, indeed, "lewd" in Old English was simply the opposite of "learned." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What hath my beloved to do in mine house</span>? "My beloved" is evidently the Jewish people, who in <a href="/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a> is called "the dearly beloved of my soul." The Divine Speaker expresses surprise that one who has now so poor a claim to the title of "my beloved" should appear in his holy house. It is spoken in the spirit of that earlier revelation of Isaiah, "When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?" (<a href="/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a>). The Jews, it would seem, came to the temple to pray, but their prayer is not accepted, because it is associated with unholy practices. They thought by formal prayers and sacrifices to pay off their debt to the Deity, and so be free to go on with their old devices (as in <a href="/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>). This seems the best view of the difficult words which follow, but it implies a correction of the certainly ungrammatical rendering of the Authorized Version - <span class="cmt_word">seeing she hath wrought lewdness</span> - into <span class="accented">to work the wicked device</span>. But here begins the most obscure part of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">With many</span> cannot be right; for "with" has nothing corresponding to it in the Hebrew; the word in the original simply means "the many," and as it is immediately followed by a noun in the singular with "and," and a verb in the plural, it is plain that it must (if correctly read) be part of the subject of the latter. The Septuagint, however, has a different reading, which may very well be correct, and out of which the received Hebrew reading may easily have grown - "Can vows and holy [i.e. hallowed] flesh remove from thee thy wickedness [or perhaps, 'thy calamity']?" The connection thus becomes easy. "Vows and holy flesh" (i.e. the flesh of sacrifices, <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>), naturally go together; the only other possible way of taking the passage (assuming the correctness of the 'received text) - " the great ones and the holy flesh shall pass away from thee" - is obviously inadmissible. "Vows and sacrifices," however, precisely express the true association of ideas. A man made a vow, and he generally paid it in the form of a sacrifice. But, inquires Jehovah, "Can such vows and such Victims please God, and expiate thy wickedness [or, 'avert thy calamity']? <span class="accented">Then thou mightest rejoice</span>." The latter words are not, indeed, more exact than those of the Authorized Version, but are in accordance with grammar, and suit the preceding question. It is not certain, however, that the text is right here; the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;</span>. (Notice that Keil, conservative to a fault in matters affecting the received text, agrees with the above correction, which is also adopted by Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">What right</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(meh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has My beloved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
