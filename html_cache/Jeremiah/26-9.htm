Prophesying in the name of the LORD was a serious matter, as it implied divine authority and truth. The people were offended because Jeremiah's prophecy contradicted their beliefs and hopes for Jerusalem. This reaction is similar to the opposition faced by other prophets, such as Elijah and Amos, who also delivered messages of judgment. The phrase underscores the tension between true and false prophecy, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>that this house will become like Shiloh</b><br>Shiloh was an ancient city where the tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant were once located. It was a significant religious center before Jerusalem. However, due to the people's unfaithfulness, Shiloh was destroyed, as referenced in <a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60-61</a>. By comparing the temple in Jerusalem to Shiloh, Jeremiah was warning that the same fate could befall them if they did not repent. This comparison would have been shocking and offensive to the people, as it implied the potential loss of God's presence and favor.<p><b>and this city will be desolate and deserted!</b><br>The prophecy of desolation and desertion was a dire warning of impending judgment. Jerusalem, the city of David and the center of Jewish worship, was seen as inviolable due to God's covenant with David. However, Jeremiah's message challenged this belief, emphasizing that God's protection was contingent upon the people's faithfulness. This prophecy foreshadows the eventual Babylonian exile, where Jerusalem was indeed left desolate, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>. The warning serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of true worship.<p><b>And all the people assembled against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</b><br>The gathering of the people against Jeremiah highlights the widespread rejection of his message. The house of the LORD, or the temple, was supposed to be a place of worship and truth, yet it became a place of confrontation. This opposition is reminiscent of the hostility faced by Jesus in the New Testament, particularly in the temple courts, as seen in <a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-22</a>. The assembly against Jeremiah illustrates the resistance to God's true messengers and the challenge of delivering unpopular truths. It also foreshadows the persecution of prophets and, ultimately, Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
