"Aven" means "wickedness" or "iniquity," and it is likely a reference to Bethel, a significant site of idolatry in Israel. The destruction of these high places signifies God's judgment against Israel's persistent idolatry. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God consistently condemns idol worship (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15</a>).<p><b>it is the sin of Israel;</b><br>Idolatry is identified as the central sin of Israel, leading to their downfall. This sin is not just a breach of the first commandment but a rejection of God's covenant. The prophets frequently highlight Israel's unfaithfulness as spiritual adultery (e.g., <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12-13</a>). The sin of idolatry is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, demonstrating the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to Yahweh amidst surrounding pagan cultures.<p><b>thorns and thistles will overgrow their altars.</b><br>The imagery of thorns and thistles symbolizes desolation and curse, reminiscent of the curse upon the ground in <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>. This suggests that the places once used for idol worship will become abandoned and desolate, overtaken by nature. It reflects the futility and ultimate end of idolatry, as these altars, once central to Israel's unfaithful worship, will be left in ruin.<p><b>Then they will say to the mountains, &#8220;Cover us!&#8221; and to the hills, &#8220;Fall on us!&#8221;</b><br>This expression of despair and desire for escape from judgment is echoed in the New Testament, specifically in <a href="/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>, where it is associated with the end times and divine judgment. It indicates a recognition of inescapable judgment and a wish for annihilation rather than facing God's wrath.

The awful words in the latter part of this verse are used by our Lord concerning the terrors of the impenitent in the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/23-30.htm" title="Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.">Luke 23:30</a>), and twice by St. John (<a href="/revelation/6-16.htm" title="And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:">Revelation 6:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-6.htm" title="And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.">Revelation 9:6</a>), to denote the extremity of despair.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The high places also of Avon, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed.</span> By Aven is generally understood <span class="accented">Beth-aven</span>, that is, Bethel; but some take the word as an appellative, and thus <span class="accented">bamoth-aven</span> would signify the "high places of iniquity." These unlawful places of sacrifice and unholy places of iniquity are further characterized by the appositional "the sin of Israel." By constructing and frequenting such places Israel had primarily and grievously sinned. By sacrificing to and worshipping even Jehovah on these high places instead of in Jerusalem, the only legal place for Divine service under the Law, their national sin in the matter of worship began; subsequently, <span class="accented">however</span>, things became worse, and these high places became scenes of most abominable idolatries and shamelessly sinful practices. Those places - one and all - are in the words before us doomed to destruction. <span class="cmt_word">The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars.</span> The destruction is thus vividly described as total and complete; those bad eminences were devoted to entire wasteness and desolation. "It is a sign of extreme solitude," says Jerome, "so that no traces even of wall or buildings remained to be seen;" similarly Rashi says, "Thorns and thistles shall grow up upon their altars, because the worshippers thereof have departed and no one longer remains to attend to them" so Kimchi: "On the altars of Israel which they (the enemies) shall lay waste shall thorns spring up." <span class="cmt_word">And they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</span> The sight of such fearful ruin and desolation overwhelms the wretched inhabitants of the land with distress and dismay; in sheer despair and even desperation they invoke a sure and sudden death as much preferable to their remaining longer spectators of such heart-rending scenes. Their exclamation appears to be proverbial, and to have had its origin in the custom of the Israelites fleeing, in seasons of great calamities, to the mountains and clefts of the rocks to hide themselves; thus in <a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a> we read that "because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and eaves, and strongholds." The object of their exclamation is to be buried under the hills or mountains rather than endure such calamities longer; or rather than the enemies should see them in their shame. Aben Ezra makes "altars" the subject of "shall say," as if it were the wish of the altars to be covered that they may never more be seen. Theodoret considers the sense of the passage to be that the multitude of calamities in the war occasioned by hostile invasion would be so great that there would be no one who would not prefer being overwhelmed in an earthquake or by the sudden fall of the mountains, rather than endure the calamities inflicted by the enemies. Similarly, but more concisely, Jerome says, "They are more willing to die than see the evils that bring death." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/10-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The high places</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1116.htm">Strong's 1116: </a> </span><span class="str2">An elevation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Aven,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1493;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;wen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_205.htm">Strong's 205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strictly nothingness, trouble, vanity, wickedness, an idol</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#7789;&#183;&#7789;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2403.htm">Strong's 2403: </a> </span><span class="str2">An offence, its penalty, occasion, sacrifice, expiation, an offender</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be destroyed;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ni&#353;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
