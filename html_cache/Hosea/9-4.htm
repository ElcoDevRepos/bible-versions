The absence of these offerings indicates a broken relationship with God, reflecting Israel's spiritual decline and disobedience. This phrase suggests a cessation of worship and a loss of divine favor, as the people have turned away from God's commandments.<p><b>and their sacrifices will not please Him</b><br>Sacrifices were central to Israelite worship, intended to atone for sin and express devotion. However, sacrifices without genuine repentance and obedience are meaningless. This echoes the prophetic theme found in <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>, where God rejects empty rituals. The people's insincere worship fails to honor God, highlighting the importance of a contrite heart over mere ritual.<p><b>but will be to them like the bread of mourners</b><br>The bread of mourners refers to food consumed during mourning, which was considered unclean according to <a href="/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14-15</a>. Eating such bread would defile a person, making them ritually impure. This imagery underscores the defilement of Israel's sacrifices, as their offerings are tainted by sin and disobedience, rendering them unacceptable to God.<p><b>all who eat will be defiled</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the contagious nature of impurity. Just as contact with the dead defiles, so does participation in insincere worship. It serves as a warning that engaging in corrupted religious practices leads to spiritual contamination, affecting the entire community. This reflects the broader biblical principle that sin has communal consequences.<p><b>For their bread will be for themselves</b><br>This indicates a self-centered approach to worship, where offerings meant for God are consumed by the people. It highlights the shift from God-centered worship to self-indulgence. This self-serving attitude contrasts with the intended purpose of sacrifices, which were to honor God and foster communal holiness.<p><b>it will not enter the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD, or the temple, was the designated place for offerings and sacrifices. The exclusion of their bread from the temple signifies a severed relationship with God and a rejection of their worship. This separation from the divine presence is a consequence of their unfaithfulness, echoing the theme of exile and spiritual estrangement found throughout the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted in Hosea as unfaithful to God, akin to an adulterous spouse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who desires true worship and obedience from His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wine_offerings_and_sacrifices.htm">Wine Offerings and Sacrifices</a></b><br>Rituals commanded in the Law of Moses, symbolizing devotion and atonement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bread_of_mourners.htm">Bread of Mourners</a></b><br>Bread consumed during mourning, considered unclean and not suitable for offerings to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/true_worship_over_rituals.htm">True Worship Over Rituals</a></b><br>God desires genuine worship from the heart rather than mere ritualistic practices.

He then renders, "They shall pour no libation of wine to Jehovah, and shall not lay out their sacrifices before Him: as food eaten in mourning is their food." This agrees better with </span><a href="/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a><span class= "note">.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them the broad of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted</span>. Having predicted their inability to observe the ritual distinctions between clean and unclean, which the Law prescribed, whether from the tyranny of their oppressors or from scarcity, or from the absence of sanctification by the presentation of the firstfruits, the prophet proceeds to predict their cessation altogether. Such is the prophet's picture of their miserable position in Assyria. It is aptly remarked by Grotius that "they failed to pour out libations to the Lord when they could; now the time shall come when they may wish to make such libations, but cannot." According to the Massoretic punctuation and the common rendering, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> which is that of the Authorized Version, the people themselves are the subject of the second verb. They were neither able to offer drink offerings, a part for the whole of the meat offerings and unbloody oblations; nor, if they did, could they hope for acceptance for them away from the sanctuary and its central altar. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig supplies <span class="accented">niskeyhens</span>, their drink offerings, from the foregoing clause, as subject to the verb of the following one, and the verb is explained by some in the sense of "mire." If <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> we neglect the <span class="accented">segholta</span>, and make <span class="accented">zibh</span>-<span class="accented">chehem</span> the subject, the meaning is clearer, and the contrast between the unbloody and bloody offerings more obvious; thus: "They will not pour out libations of wine to Jehovah, nor will their sacrifices [equivalent to 'bloody oblations'] please him," that is to say, not such as were actually offered, but such as they might feel dis. posed to offer. The same noun may be repeated in next clause; thus, their sacrifices, or rather slaughtered meats, are unto him as bread of mourners, or, what is better, <span class="accented">their food</span> (supplied from <span class="accented">ke</span> <span class="accented">lechem</span>) <span class="accented">shall be unto them like bread of mourners</span>. Mourners' bread is that eaten at a funeral feast, or meal by persons mourning for the dead, and which was legally unclean, since a corpse defiled the house in which it was and all who entered it for seven days, as we read in <a href="/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14</a>, "This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days." Of course, all who partook of the food would be polluted; so with that of Israel in exile, being unsanctified by the offering of firstfruits. <span class="cmt_word">For their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the Lord.</span> "Their bread for their soul," that is, for appeasing their appetite, whatsoever their soul lusted after, or bread for the preservation of their life, would not come into the house of the Lord to be sanctified by representative offerings. <span class="cmt_word">What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the Lord?</span> On such occasions they would feel the misery of their position most keenly. Away in a far foreign land, without temple and without ritual, they would bewail the loss of their annual celebrations, their national festivals and religious solemnities - those holiday-times of general joy and spiritual gladness. The distinction between <span class="accented">moed</span> and <span class="accented">chag</span> is variously given.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/9-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pour out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yis&#183;s&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5258.htm">Strong's 5258: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pour out, a libation, to cast, to anoint a, king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wine [offerings]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3196.htm">Strong's 3196: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wine, intoxication</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;
