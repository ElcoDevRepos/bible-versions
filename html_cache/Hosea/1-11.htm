Historically, after the reign of Solomon, the kingdom split into the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). This prophecy envisions a future time when the division will be healed, reflecting God's ultimate plan for unity among His people. This gathering can be seen as a foreshadowing of the eschatological gathering of God's people, as mentioned in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-22</a>, where God promises to unite the divided kingdoms under one king.<p><b>and they will appoint for themselves one leader</b><br>The appointment of "one leader" suggests a future messianic figure who will unite the people. In the context of biblical prophecy, this is often interpreted as a reference to the Messiah, who Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. This leader is seen as a shepherd-king, reminiscent of David, who will guide and rule over a united Israel. This echoes prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1-10</a>, which speak of a righteous ruler from the line of David.<p><b>and will go up out of the land</b><br>This phrase can be understood as a metaphor for deliverance and restoration. Historically, it may refer to the return from exile, as the Israelites were taken captive by Assyria and Babylon. Spiritually, it signifies liberation from sin and oppression, pointing to the ultimate redemption through Christ. The imagery of "going up" often denotes a pilgrimage or return to a place of blessing, akin to the exodus from Egypt.<p><b>For great will be the day of Jezreel</b><br>The "day of Jezreel" is a complex term. Jezreel means "God sows," and it is both a place of judgment and future hope. Historically, Jezreel was a site of significant bloodshed and judgment (2 Kings 9-10). However, in this context, it symbolizes a future time of blessing and restoration. The "great day" suggests a reversal of past judgments, aligning with the theme of redemption and renewal found throughout the prophetic literature. This transformation from judgment to blessing is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting God's redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, representing the southern kingdom after the division of Israel.

A world-wide dominion shall be established under the restored theocracy. Under the word "land," no reference is made by the prophet to exile, either in Babylon, Assyria, or Egypt, but Palestine is evidently meant. Then the true Israel, having chosen their true king, shall demonstrate the greatness of the day of Jezreel. The brothers and sisters will then drop the curse involved in their names, and recognise the Divine proprietorship of Jehovah and the abundance of His pity.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land.</span> The phraseology of the older Scriptures is here followed. Thus we read in <a href="/exodus/1-10.htm">Exodus 1:10</a>, in the words of Pharaoh, the children of Israel "getting them up out of the land" (comp. also <a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a> and <a href="/numbers/32-11.htm">Numbers 32:11</a>); and again, on the report of the spies when the people murmured against Moses and Aaron, "they said one to another, Let us make a captain [head], and let us return into Egypt." In this way the scenes of former days were in some sense to be repeated: an exodus of some sort was again to take place; Egypt was to be abandoned and slavery left behind; they might have a wilderness to traverse, but here again the prospect of a land of promise was to cheer them on their journey and compensate them at its close; in fact, another or better Canaan was before them. Nay, more, the breach between Judah and Israel would be healed, and the disruption which had been so disastrous become a thing of the past. Judah and Israel would again unite and rally together under one head. But the important inquiry remains as to the how or when this prediction was to have fulfillment. Even if we admit the return from the captivity of Babylon to be a fulfillment, it would be but a very partial, though literal, fulfillment of such a grand prediction. That restoration was far too meager in its dimensions to come up to the requirements of, much less exhaust, such a splendid prophecy. Some of Israel - a mere fragment of the ten tribes - united with Judah in the relearn from Babylon: this poor miniature fulfillment, if we may so say, cannot be regarded, except perhaps typically or symbolically, as the fulfillment of the prophet's vivid picture. We must look to gospel times and gospel scenes for the realization of the glorious promise under consideration. Jewish interpreters themselves refer it to the times of Messiah. Thus Kimchi says, "This shall take place in the gathering together of the exiles in the days of the Messiah, for unto the second house there went up only Judah and Benjamin that had been exiles in Babylon; nor were the children of Judah and the children of Israel gathered together; and they shall make for themselves one head, - this is the King Messiah;" similarly, in the 'Betsudath David,' by Altschul, we read on this passage," <span class="accented">They shall be gathered together</span>: this will come to pass in the days of the Messiah. <span class="accented">One head</span>: this is the King Messiah. <span class="accented">And they shall come up</span>; out of the lands of the captivity they shall go up unto their own land." We cannot possibly mistake the objects of this prophecy; they are expressly declared to be "the children of Judah and the children of Israel" - the two distinctive branches of the Hebrew race, the two constituent elements of the Jewish nationality, and comprehending the whole natural posterity of Israel. There can be just as little doubt about the primary and proper application of the prophecy to the conversion of the people of the Jews. For a time they were not to be the people of God; but the testimony of the prophet to their again becoming the sons of the living God is quite unmistakable. They shall appoint themselves one head. "The prophet," says Calvin, "has, by the expression, characterized the obedience of faith; for it is not enough that Christ should be given as a King, and set over men, unless they also embrace him as their King, and with reverence receive him. We now learn that, when we believe the gospel, we choose Christ for our King, as it were, by a voluntary consent." The words are adopted by both Peter and Paul: the former (<a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>) employs them as an appropriate description, in Old Testament language, of the happy change of condition consequent on the knowledge of the truth; the latter (<a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25</a>) quotes them more formally in an extension of their meaning beyond their primary import, and proper and literal application to the Jews, as an exemplification of the principle of <span class="accented">once not my people, now my people</span>. In this extension of their meaning they embrace, no doubt, the Gentiles, though not the objects originally and chiefly contemplated in the prophecy. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If the place mentioned in the previous verse be, the place or lands of their dispersion, on the change indicated taking place, namely, their conversion to Christ as King, then their coming up out of the laud under the sole headship of the Son of David, the true Shepherd of Israel, may denote their restoration out of all the countries of their dispersion to their ancient territory, again become their own land, and their own in perpetual possession. Thus the Targum understands it of the land of the Jews' captivity; likewise Kimchi: "They shall go up out of the land of their captivity to their own land; for the laud of Israel is higher than all lands, and he that goeth thither goeth up, and he that goeth out of it goeth down." The initial and typical fulfillment was the return of Judah, joined by many Israelites, out of Babylon under Zerubbabel. The final fulfillment may be the restoration of the Jews, converted and believing in Messiah, under Divine guidance, to their own land. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> If, on the other hand, the place of the preceding verse be Palestine, the land of their rejection and subsequent recognition as the sons of God, the going up may refer to the going up of the inhabitants of both kingdoms to Jerusalem, the dwelling-place of their common king of David's line; not in the sense of going up, as Ewald and others understand it, to do battle in order to widen the boundaries of their native hind and make room for the returning exiles. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> But whether the place be the country of Palestine or the lands of their dispersion, the going up may be understood spiritually of their coming up to join themselves to the Church, or rather to the Church's Head, as under the old economy the tribes of Israel went up out of all parts of the land to worship at Jerusalem. It will thus apply properly enough to their spiritual journey onward and upward to the heavenly Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">For great shall be the day of Jezreel.</span> The names of the prophet's children were names of ill omen - God's sowing in the sense of God's <span class="accented">scattering</span>, Not-my-people, Not-pitied; now the evil is eliminated, the meaning of the second and third is reversed, and the first is read in a new signification, so that Not-my-people becomes My people, Unpitied becomes Pitied, God's sowing is no longer God's scattering but God's growing. The curse is thus changed into a blessing; great, then, shall be the day so signalized by Divine goodness, so glorious in Divine grace, and so conspicuous for the wondrous works of the covenant-keeping God. Most of the older interpreters take <span class="accented">Jezreel</span> here, as in vers. 4 and 5, equivalent to "scattered of God." Aben Ezra says, "But the iniquity of the house of Israel is punished. And behold, it is all said by way of reproach, not praise." <span class="cmt_sub_title"><a href="/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</span> Divine mercy being now received, the recipients are urged to extend to each other the right hand of fellowship, exhorting one another, encouraging one smother, confirming each other in the faith, and mutually provoking each other to love and good works. "Because the comparison deals with a son and a daughter, the prophet therefore adds, 'your brothers and your sisters'" (Kimchi).  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
