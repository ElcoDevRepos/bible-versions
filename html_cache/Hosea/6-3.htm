In the context of Hosea, the Israelites are being called to return to God amidst their unfaithfulness. The repetition of "know" and "press on" suggests an active, ongoing effort rather than a passive acknowledgment. This pursuit of knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational, reflecting the covenant relationship God desires with His people. The call to "know the LORD" echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which commands love and devotion to God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. It also anticipates the New Covenant promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, where knowing the LORD will be a defining characteristic of God's people.<p><b>As surely as the sun rises, He will appear;</b><br>This phrase uses the certainty of the sunrise to assure the people of God's faithfulness and His inevitable intervention. The imagery of the sun rising is a common biblical metaphor for God's reliability and the renewal of His mercies, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>. The assurance of His appearance can be seen as a promise of His presence and deliverance, reminiscent of the hope found in <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>, where the "sun of righteousness" will rise with healing. This also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who is described as the light of the world in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, bringing spiritual illumination and salvation.<p><b>He will come to us like the rain,</b><br>Rain in the ancient Near East was a vital and life-giving force, essential for agriculture and survival. This imagery conveys God's provision and blessing, as well as His refreshing and renewing presence. In <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>, rain is depicted as a sign of God's favor and faithfulness to His covenant. The comparison to rain also suggests the idea of spiritual revival and cleansing, aligning with the prophetic hope of restoration and renewal for Israel. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings spiritual nourishment and life, as described in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where Jesus offers living water that quenches spiritual thirst.<p><b>like the spring showers that water the earth.</b><br>Spring showers are associated with new growth and fertility, symbolizing the rejuvenating and sustaining power of God. This imagery highlights the transformative effect of God's presence, bringing life and fruitfulness to His people. The reference to spring showers connects to the agricultural cycles in Israel, where the early and latter rains were crucial for a successful harvest, as mentioned in <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>. This promise of divine intervention and blessing is a reminder of God's ongoing care and provision, encouraging the faithful to trust in His timing and sovereignty. The showers can also be seen as a metaphor for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, as prophesied in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, bringing spiritual renewal and empowerment to the believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst widespread idolatry and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted in Hosea as unfaithful to God, akin to an adulterous spouse, yet still the recipient of God's persistent love and call to repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who desires a relationship with His people and is depicted as faithful and restorative, like the rain that nourishes the earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rain_and_spring_showers.htm">Rain and Spring Showers</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's faithfulness and the life-giving nature of His presence, these natural phenomena illustrate the certainty and refreshment of God's coming to His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sun.htm">The Sun</a></b><br>Represents the certainty and regularity of God's presence and intervention, just as the sun rises each day without fail.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuit_of_knowledge.htm">Pursuit of Knowledge</a></b><br>Believers are called to actively seek and deepen their understanding of God.

So it is with God&#8217;s presence&#8212;freely given, never earned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like the spring showers that water the earth</b><p>&#8220;Spring showers&#8221; (the latter rains) arrive in Israel just before harvest, ensuring fruitfulness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a> celebrates these timely rains as evidence of covenant faithfulness; <a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7-8</a> uses the same cycle to encourage patient expectancy until Christ&#8217;s return.<p>&#8226; Seasonal language reminds us that God&#8217;s timing is perfect. He sends exactly what is needed, exactly when it is needed (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise is literal&#8212;God truly controlled Israel&#8217;s weather&#8212;and spiritual, pointing to assured provision for every obedient believer (<a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a> calls God&#8217;s people to relentless, hope-filled pursuit of Him. As we press on to know the LORD, we are assured&#8212;by the unfailing dawn and by life-giving rains&#8212;that He will certainly reveal Himself, refresh us, and bring us to fruitfulness. The verse blends present invitation with future promise, grounding both in the unwavering faithfulness of the God who speaks and acts exactly as His Word declares.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.</span> This is more accurately rendered by, <span class="accented">let</span> us <span class="accented">therefore</span> know, <span class="accented">hunt after the knowledge of Jehovah</span>, the verbs being both cohortative and no conditional particle ("if") in the second clause. The second clause is a more emphatic and energetic reaffirmation of the first, urging to active and zealous effort and steady perseverance in obtaining the knowledge of God - a knowledge theoretic, but especially practical. Aben Ezra understands the exhortation of intellectual knowledge: "To know Jehovah is the secret of all wisdom, and for this alone was man created. But he cannot know God till he has learnt many doctrines of wisdom, which are, as it were, a ladder in order to mount up to this highest step of knowledge." Kimchi, on the other hand, though quoting Aben Ezra's comment with approval, inclines to the practical side of knowledge: "Let us follow on to know Jehovah, exercising justice and righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">His going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</span> Here, again, the translation of the Authorized Version is susceptible of improvement: <span class="accented">his going forth is fixed as the morning dawn</span>; <span class="accented">and he shall come to us as the plentiful rain, as the latter rain which watereth</span> (or, <span class="accented">watering</span>) <span class="accented">the earth</span>. Here we have two beautiful figures - the morning dawn and the fertilizing rain. The going forth of Jehovah is represented as the sun rising upon the earth, or rather as the dawn which heralds the day. The advent of salvation to his people is identified with, or symbolized by, his appearance. But the dawn of day only brings the commencement of salvation; its complement is found in the fruits and blessings of salvation. The root of <span class="accented">motsav</span> is <span class="accented">zatsa</span>, which is applied to the sunrise in <a href="/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23</a>, as also in <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>. Parallel passages are found in <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, "Then shall thy light break forth as the morning (dawn), and thy health shall spring forth speedily;" and Isaiah 9:2, "The Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee." Further, the word <span class="accented">nakon</span>, meaning "prepared," "fixed firm," is applied to the clear bright light of morning, as in <a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>, "The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect (<span class="accented">nekon</span>) day." The plentiful rain is that which falls after the sowing of the seed in October (the beginning of the Hebrew year) and in the following months; while the <span class="accented">malqosh</span> is the late or spring rain, which, tailing in March and till the middle of April, precedes and promotes the harvest. The LXX. translates the <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> concluding clause by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> erroneously, for <span class="accented">zoreh</span> is not a noun with b, being understood before "earth;" neither is it <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the future Hiph., which would necessitate the ellipse being supplied by <span class="accented">asher</span>; it is the Qal participle in the sense of" watering." <span class="accented">Geshem</span> is "a violent or plentiful rain," stronger than the usual word for" rain," <span class="accented">matar</span>; while <span class="accented">malqosh</span> is "the late rain" which ceases a short time before harvest. The explanation of the "dawn" by Aben Ezra is erroneous: "The intelligent man at the beginning knows God - blessed be he! - by his works, like the dawn of day in its going forth; but moment after moment the light increases, until the full truth becomes visible." Kimchi more correctly explains the figure as follows: "If we shall do this, viz. follow on to know the Lord, then he will be to us as the morning dawn, of which the going forth is fixed [purposed by God and certain] as though he said, He will cause his light and his goodness to shine over us." His comment on the second similitude is equally appropriate: "He will come to us as the plentiful rain, as the plentiful rain which revives the dead plants; so man sunk in sorrow is like one dead; but when deliverance comes to him it is with him as if he revived out of his dead state." Thus he shall be to his people as "morning to the weary watcher," and as "plentiful rain to the parched ground." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So let us know&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
