In ancient Near Eastern culture, nakedness was often associated with disgrace and humiliation. The act of stripping someone naked symbolized the removal of protection and honor. In the context of Hosea, this represents God's judgment on Israel for her unfaithfulness, likening the nation to an unfaithful wife. The reference to "the day of her birth" suggests a return to a state of helplessness and dependency, emphasizing the severity of the judgment. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature, such as <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, where Israel's unfaithfulness is depicted in similar terms.<p><b>I will make her like a desert and turn her into a parched land,</b><br>The transformation into a desert signifies desolation and barrenness. In the biblical context, deserts are often places of testing and judgment, as seen in the Israelites' wanderings in the wilderness. The imagery of a "parched land" underscores the absence of life and sustenance, reflecting the consequences of Israel's spiritual adultery. This desolation can be seen as a reversal of the blessings promised to Israel, such as the land flowing with milk and honey. The prophetic message warns of the physical and spiritual drought that results from turning away from God.<p><b>and I will let her die of thirst.</b><br>Thirst in the Bible often symbolizes a deep spiritual need or longing. In this context, dying of thirst represents the ultimate consequence of Israel's separation from God, who is the source of living water. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, where God is described as the "spring of living water," and the people's rejection of Him leads to spiritual drought. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>), offering eternal satisfaction to those who believe in Him.

Probably we have here an allusion to the custom of female infanticide, which still prevails very widely in the East, as it did in the ancient world, the child being simply abandoned to death on the day that she was born. (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/16-4.htm" title="And as for your nativity, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, neither were you washed in water to supple you; you were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.">Ezekiel 16:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born.</span> The Lord, by his servant the prophet, enforces the preceding exhortation by a stern denunciation, and the threat of further severities unless averted by repentance; as an injured husband withdraws from a faithless wife all the gifts and presents he had made for her adornment, leaving her poor and bare. Not only the removal of her garments by way of degradation and disgrace, but exposure in that position to insult and ignominy would ensue. In other words, the nation is threatened with deprivation of all the blessings previously lavished upon them - property, prosperity, population, and privileges; while dishonor of the deepest dye would aggravate the misery. The day of the nation's birth denotes the weakness and wretchedness of their infant state. To this corresponded their servile, suffering condition during their bondage and oppression in Egypt. Rashi thus explains it; Kimchi says, "The figure of birth is the time they are slaves in Egypt;" so also Theodoret, - the latter calls the day of her birth the sojourn in Egypt. The Prophet Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>) expands the idea, occasionally employing, as Rosenm&uuml;ller remarks, the very words of Hosea. <span class="cmt_word">And make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and clay her with thirst.</span> This part of the verse is susceptible of two explanations. The faithless female, under which character the northern kingdom is personified, may be compared to a wilderness, that is, according to Cyril, fruitless, parched, and productive only of thorns, thirsty and waterless. This comparison of a woman to a desert is wanting in suitability, and seems in some degree awkward in itself, beside being out of harmony with the closing clause; for to "<span class="accented">slay</span> with thirst," however applicable to a person, cannot with any propriety be said of a place, whether desert or otherwise. No doubt the wilderness may stand for those dwelling in it. We prefer, therefore, the alternative rendering, "make her as <span class="accented">in</span> a wilderness, and set her as <span class="accented">in</span> a dry land." Rashi aptly explains the threat to mean, "<span class="accented">Lest</span> I pronounce against them such a sentence as of old in this desert (<a href="/numbers/14-35.htm">Numbers 14:35</a>), 'In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.'" There <span class="accented">is</span>, moreover, a natural connection of ideas between a wilderness, a dry land, and thirst. The nation's birth, represented by or compared to their sojourn in Egypt, naturally suggests the idea of their wandering in the wilderness after their exodus from that country; a wilderness, again, suggests what is an ordinary feature of such a district, namely, a dry land; while a region thus without water is suggestive as well as provocative of thirst. The former explanation, however, is given by Kimehi: "I will make thee like the wilderness which is open to every one, and in which, moreover, one finds no means of subsistence, nor anything that man needs; so I'll withdraw my goodness from them, and they shall be surrendered as a prey to every one." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Otherwise,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(pen-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6435.htm">Strong's 6435: </a> </span><span class="str2">Removal, lest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will strip</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1496;&#1462;&#1443;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;&#7789;en&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - first person common singular &#124;
