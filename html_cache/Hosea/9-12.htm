Despite their attempts to nurture and raise their offspring, the consequences of their idolatry and unfaithfulness to God will overshadow their efforts. This echoes the covenant curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to loss and suffering. The raising of children in ancient Israel was a significant aspect of family and societal continuity, emphasizing the gravity of this judgment.<p><b>I will bereave them of each one.</b><br>The bereavement mentioned here is a direct result of divine judgment. In the historical context, this could refer to the loss of children through war, exile, or disease, common consequences of national disobedience. The term "bereave" indicates a deep, personal loss, highlighting the severity of God's judgment. This aligns with the prophetic warnings given by other prophets, such as Jeremiah, who also spoke of the loss of children as a consequence of turning away from God.<p><b>Yes, woe be to them</b><br>"Woe" is a term often used by prophets to announce impending doom or judgment. It serves as a lament and a warning, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. In the cultural context of the time, a pronouncement of woe would have been understood as a grave declaration, signaling that the people were in a dire state due to their actions. This connects to the broader biblical theme of woe pronounced upon nations and individuals who reject God's ways, as seen in Isaiah and Revelation.<p><b>when I turn away from them!</b><br>God turning away signifies the withdrawal of His protection and favor, leaving the people vulnerable to their enemies and the consequences of their sins. This is a reversal of the covenant relationship, where God promised to be with His people if they remained faithful. Theologically, this reflects the concept of divine abandonment as a result of persistent sin, a theme also found in <a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>, where God gives people over to their desires when they reject Him. This turning away is a precursor to the eventual exile of Israel, fulfilling the prophetic warnings given throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's ministry was marked by his marriage to Gomer, which symbolized Israel's unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which was experiencing moral and spiritual decline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The context of this verse is God's impending judgment on Israel due to their persistent idolatry and unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_unfaithfulness.htm">The Consequences of Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>God's judgment on Israel serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from Him.

The Lord now intensifies the warning: even the children who do survive infancy will not guarantee blessing.<p>&#8226; Similar covenant cautions appear in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-41.htm">Deuteronomy 28:41</a>, &#8220;You will father sons and daughters, but they will not remain yours, because they will go into captivity&#8221;. The point is unmistakable: disobedience strips away even the natural joys of parenting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will bereave them of each one</b><p>&#8226; God, not chance, is the active Agent: &#8220;I will bereave&#8230;.&#8221; His righteous judgment removes the very gifts He once gave (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Each one&#8221; underscores totality. The threat is not isolated tragedy but sweeping loss (<a href="/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-16.htm">Hosea 13:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Bereavement in Scripture often signals both emotional agony and national devastation; <a href="/lamentations/1-16.htm">Lamentations 1:16</a> connects the two. Here, the Lord warns that rebellion will lead to the aching emptiness every parent dreads.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yes, woe be to them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Woe&#8221; combines sorrow and condemnation. It laments the people&#8217;s coming pain while affirming that the pain is deserved (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37&#8211;38</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s heart is grieved (<a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8&#8211;9</a>), yet His holiness demands He pronounce &#8220;woe&#8221; on persistent sin. Love and justice meet in this sobering word.<p>&#8226; The warning is pastoral: by declaring &#8220;woe,&#8221; the Lord still invites repentance before the sentence falls (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When I turn away from them!</b><p>&#8226; The climax is abandonment: the worst fate is not simply losing children but losing God&#8217;s favorable presence (<a href="/numbers/14-42.htm">Numbers 14:42&#8211;43</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Hosea, divine withdrawal equals calamity (<a href="/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). Without God&#8217;s nearness, protection ceases, enemies advance, hope evaporates.<p>&#8226; The sentence stresses timing&#8212;&#8220;when.&#8221; If the people do not return to Him, a moment will arrive when He turns away, and the resulting cascade of losses cannot be stopped (<a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/9-12.htm">Hosea 9:12</a> paints a layered warning. Parents may labor to raise children, yet covenant unfaithfulness will rip those children away. The Lord Himself will act, leaving Israel bereft, announcing &#8220;woe,&#8221; and finally withdrawing His presence. The verse showcases God&#8217;s unwavering justice and His heartbreak over sin, urging every reader to cling to Him in obedience and trust.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/9-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they raise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7713;ad&#183;d&#601;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1431.htm">Strong's 1431: </a> </span><span class="str2">To grow up, become great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their children,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
