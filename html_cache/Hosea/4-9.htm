In ancient Israel, priests were expected to be spiritual leaders and examples of holiness. However, when the priests themselves were corrupt, the people followed suit. This reflects the principle that leadership influences the behavior of the community. The phrase suggests a breakdown in the covenant relationship between God and His people, as both priests and people have turned away from God's laws. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>, where the sons of Eli, who were priests, led the people into sin.<p><b>I will punish both of them for their ways</b><br>God's judgment is impartial and just, extending to both the leaders and the people. The "ways" refer to the sinful behaviors and idolatrous practices that have become prevalent. This punishment is a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience to God's commands would lead to consequences. The historical context of Hosea's ministry during the 8th century BC, a time of political instability and moral decay in Israel, underscores the urgency of this warning.<p><b>and repay them for their deeds.</b><br>The concept of divine retribution is central here, where God promises to repay individuals according to their actions. This reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>. The deeds of the people and priests, characterized by idolatry and injustice, warrant divine recompense. This repayment is not only punitive but also serves as a call to repentance, urging the nation to return to covenant faithfulness. The prophetic message of Hosea consistently points to the hope of restoration if the people turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst rampant idolatry and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often characterized by its unfaithfulness to God, which led to its eventual downfall and exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Israel who were responsible for teaching the law and leading the people in worship.

He has involved himself in sin and punishment like the people, and that as the consequence of his extreme unfaithfulness; whereas by faithful dealing with the people and discharge of his duty he might have delivered his own soul, as stated by <a href="/ezekiel/33-9.htm">Ezekiel 33:9</a>, "Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul." It is well explained by Kimchi as follows: "These two <span class="accented">caphs</span> of likeness are by way of abbreviation, and the explanation is - the people are like the priest and the priest is like the people. And the meaning is that, as the people and the priest are equal with respect to sin, so shall they be equal in relation to punishment." <span class="cmt_word">And I will visit upon his ways, and his doings I will bring back to him.</span> The retribution here threatened includes the whole priestly order, not people and priest as one man, according to Pusey, who, however, makes the following excellent comment on <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>: "The word rendered <span class="accented">doings</span> signifies <span class="accented">great doings</span> when used of God, <span class="accented">bold doings</span> on the part of man. These bold presumptuous doings against the Law and will of God, God will bring back to the sinner's bosom," or rather, down overwhelmingly upon his head. The singular individualizes; so both Aben Ezra and Kimchi: "Upon every one of them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And it shall be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
