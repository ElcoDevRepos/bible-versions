Historically, Israel's monarchy began with God's approval when He chose Saul and later David. However, after Solomon's reign, the kingdom divided, and the northern kingdom of Israel often installed kings through political intrigue and rebellion, ignoring divine will. This reflects a broader biblical theme where human authority is established without God's blessing, leading to chaos and judgment, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7-9</a> when Israel demanded a king to be like other nations.<p><b>They make princes, but without My approval.</b><br>The appointment of princes or leaders without God's consent further emphasizes Israel's self-reliance and rejection of divine authority. In the ancient Near East, rulers were often seen as divinely appointed, yet Israel's actions here show a departure from this belief. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>, where Jeroboam became king through popular support rather than divine selection, leading to idolatry and sin. The lack of divine approval signifies a breach in the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>With their silver and gold they make themselves idols,</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue in Israel, directly violating the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The use of silver and gold for idol-making indicates both the wealth and spiritual corruption of the people. Archaeological findings in ancient Israelite sites reveal numerous idols and religious artifacts, confirming the prevalence of idol worship. This practice was influenced by surrounding pagan cultures, such as the Canaanites, who worshipped Baal and Asherah. The prophets frequently condemned this syncretism, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-4</a>.<p><b>to their own destruction.</b><br>The consequence of idolatry and disobedience is destruction, a recurring theme in prophetic literature. Hosea warns that turning away from God leads to inevitable ruin, both spiritually and physically. This destruction is not only a result of divine judgment but also the natural outcome of abandoning God's protective covenant. The Assyrian conquest of Israel in 722 BC serves as a historical fulfillment of this prophecy, where the northern kingdom was destroyed due to its persistent idolatry and rebellion. This aligns with the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often rebelling against God and engaging in idolatry during Hosea's time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_and_princes.htm">Kings and Princes</a></b><br>Leaders established by the people of Israel without seeking God's guidance or approval.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship made from silver and gold, representing the people's departure from worshiping the true God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who desires His people to seek His will in all matters, including leadership and worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>Recognize that God desires to be involved in the selection of leaders.

But it is best to regard the passage as referring to the short reigns of usurpers and to the foul murders which disgraced the annals of the northern kingdom since the death of Jeroboam II. Jehovah repudiates all participation in their anarchy.<p><span class= "bld">Knew it not.</span>--Should be, <span class= "ital">knew them not</span>--viz., the gold and silver splendours wherewith Israel had adorned its apostacy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not.</span> Here was the first instance and evidence of Israel's rejection of Jehovah. Their conduct was not guided by Divine direction, nor in obedience to the Divine will, nor with the Divine sanction. This state of things began with Israel's revolt from the house of David, and rebellion against the son of Solomon their legitimate sovereign, and was repeated in subsequent usurpations. Perhaps we may go further back, even to the appointment of the first king of the yet undivided kingdom, when "the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them." Usurpations such as those of Zimri, Omri, and Shallum at least are comprehended in the appointments referred to - appointments on making which the people did not inquire of the Lord, nor act under his guidance, nor seek his sanction. Some go so far as to include all the kings of Israel that succeeded Jeroboam. Thus Cyril says, "He denies the kingdom of Israel and his successors on the throne of Israel." Aben Ezra also extends the statement to the kings of the northern kingdom from the days of Jeroboam: "They inquired not of God with respect to the making of Jeroboam king, although it is written, ' Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose.'" A seeming contradiction here exists between the statement of the prophet here and that in <a href="/1_kings/11-37.htm">1 Kings 11:37</a>, where God promises by the Prophet Ahijah, "I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel," and the fact of Jehu's anointing being ordered by the Prophet Elisha, who sent one of the children of the prophets for that purpose with the words, "Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel." The plotting of Jeroboam, and the conspiracy of Jehu against Joram, and the conspiracies of other usurpers, were things which God could not approve; and so we must distinguish between the permission and approval of Jehovah; in his government he permits many things which from his nature we know he does not and cannot approve. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span> is usually and properly rendered, "they have made princes;" but Aben Ezra and Rashi translate it as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> equivalent to "they have removed;" while the Massora reckon <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span> in the number of those words which are written with <span class="accented">shin</span> but are read and explained with <span class="accented">samech</span>. Some manuscripts also of Kennicett and De Rossi have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span>. Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they (literally, <span class="accented">it</span>) may be cut off. This is a second proof of Israel's renunciation of Jehovah. They used their gold in making the idolatrous calves, and their silver in supporting their idolatrous worship; or they made the idol-calves, some of silver, and others of gold. The consequence rather than the purpose is the destruction of it, namely, the gold and silver; or the ruin of the kingdom or of each member of it; or the cutting off of their name, according to Kimchi. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in Greek, is generally relic, denoting "purpose;" nor is it <span class="accented">ecbatic</span> here, denoting "result," though, according to the Hebrew mode of thought, design and consequence often coincide.
