This phrase indicates that the people are attempting to seek God through ritualistic means, bringing their animals as sacrifices. However, their actions are superficial, lacking genuine repentance or heartfelt devotion. This reflects a broader theme in the Old Testament where God desires obedience and a contrite heart over mere ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a>). The Israelites' reliance on external rituals without true faith mirrors the practices condemned by prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>).<p><b>but they do not find Him;</b><br>Despite their efforts, the Israelites are unable to find God. This suggests a spiritual blindness or separation due to their sin and idolatry. The inability to find God despite religious activity highlights the futility of empty rituals. It echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>, where seeking God with all one's heart and soul is necessary to truly find Him. The people's failure to find God is a consequence of their unfaithfulness and serves as a call to genuine repentance.<p><b>He has withdrawn Himself from them.</b><br>God's withdrawal signifies His judgment and displeasure with Israel's unfaithfulness. This withdrawal is not arbitrary but a response to persistent sin and idolatry. It reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and presence are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The withdrawal of God's presence is a severe consequence, as seen in other instances like the Babylonian exile (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate separation from God due to sin, which is reconciled through Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity (<a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's ministry was marked by his marriage to Gomer, symbolizing Israel's unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, engaging in idolatry and alliances with foreign nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The Southern Kingdom, also warned by Hosea, though not as prominently as Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who desires faithfulness and true worship from His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/flocks_and_herds.htm">Flocks and Herds</a></b><br>Symbolic of the sacrifices and offerings brought by the Israelites in their religious practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/true_worship_over_ritual.htm">True Worship Over Ritual</a></b><br>God desires genuine devotion and obedience rather than mere ritualistic practices.

The spirit with which sacrifices of flocks and herds were offered is of more consequence than the multitude of such oblations (<a href="/micah/3-4.htm" title="Then shall they cry to the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.">Micah 3:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm" title="Sacrifice and offering you did not desire; my ears have you opened: burnt offering and sin offering have you not required.">Psalm 40:6</a>). Ghastly and revolting results follow the substitution of ritual of any kind for the weightier matter of the law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord.</span> In this way they attempt to break, if not pro-vent, their fall. With numerous and costly sacrifices they endeavor to propitiate Jehovah. With sheep and goats out of their flocks, and with bullocks and heifers out of their herd, they try to make reparation for the past or to secure present and future favor. But in vain. Israel might go to Bethel and Judah to Jerusalem; but to no purpose. <span class="cmt_word">They shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself</span>. Their repentance came too late; or when it did come it wanted sincerity; or it was a wrong motive which prompted it - fear of approaching calamity and not love to their Creator; or their sins ran parallel with their sacrifice. Forgetting that obedience is better than sacrifice, they cherished a disobedient spirit or continued in their course of disobedience notwithstanding their outward sacrificial service. For one cause or other they fail in their efforts to find him; for, instead of being a present help in time of trouble, he has withdrawn beyond their reach; he has removed the Shechinah-glory of his presence from among them; or he has loosed himself from all those ties that once bound him in mercy to them, just as a husband frees himself from all responsibilities and disarms all liabilities on behalf of a faithless partner whom he has been forced to divorce. And such is the specific reason assigned in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1469;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with their flocks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;n&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
