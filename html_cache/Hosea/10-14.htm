The "roar of battle" suggests a loud and overwhelming attack, symbolizing God's judgment against Israel for their unfaithfulness. Historically, Israel faced numerous invasions due to their disobedience, as seen in the Assyrian conquest. The imagery of a "roar" emphasizes the terror and chaos of war, reminiscent of other biblical passages where God allows foreign nations to discipline His people (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26-30</a>).<p><b>so that all your fortresses will be demolished</b><br>Fortresses were symbols of security and strength in ancient times. The destruction of these fortresses signifies the complete vulnerability and defeat of Israel. This echoes the futility of relying on human defenses instead of God, as seen in Psalms 127:1, which states that unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain. The historical context includes the fall of Samaria, Israel's capital, to the Assyrians in 722 BC.<p><b>as Shalman devastated Beth-arbel in the day of battle</b><br>"Shalman" likely refers to Shalmaneser V, the Assyrian king who besieged Samaria. Beth-arbel's destruction serves as a historical example of the devastation awaiting Israel. While the exact location of Beth-arbel is uncertain, it represents a place of significant defeat. This reference underscores the certainty of God's judgment, drawing parallels to other instances where God used foreign powers to execute His will (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3-6</a>).<p><b>when mothers were dashed to pieces along with their children</b><br>This phrase highlights the brutality and totality of the coming destruction. The mention of mothers and children emphasizes the depth of the tragedy, as even the most vulnerable are not spared. Such imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to depict severe judgment (e.g., <a href="/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>). It serves as a stark warning of the consequences of turning away from God, illustrating the complete desolation that sin brings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, whose ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst their idolatry and moral decline.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shalman.htm">Shalman</a></b><br>Likely a reference to Shalmaneser, an Assyrian king known for his military campaigns and conquests, symbolizing impending judgment and destruction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-arbel.htm">Beth-arbel</a></b><br>A location that experienced a devastating attack, serving as a historical example of the destruction that awaits Israel due to their unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which is the primary audience of Hosea's prophecies, facing judgment for their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>Represents the divine judgment coming upon Israel, depicted through the imagery of warfare and destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>God's warnings through the prophets are not idle threats.

The prophet seems to hear the advance of the invading army, and see the fall of Samaria's fortress.<p><span class= "bld">Shalman.</span>--The references in the margin are not to the same historic event. The allusion is very obscure. Schrader (<span class= "ital">Keilinschriften,</span> 2nd ed., pp. 440-2) suggests two theories: one that it refers to an episode in the campaign of Shalmaneser III. to the "cedar country" (Lebanon), in 775 B.C., or to Damascus in 773. He might then have penetrated into the Transjordanic country, and destroyed Arbela, near Pella (Beth-arbel). The other theory, that we have here a mention of the Moabitish king <span class= "ital">Salmanu,</span> whose name occurs in Tiglath-pileser's inscription, is far-fetched and improbable. On the other hand, Geiger, following the hint of Jerome, identifies Shalman with Zalmunna (<a href="/judges/8-18.htm" title="Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom you slew at Tabor? And they answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.">Judges 8:18</a>; comp. <a href="/psalms/83-11.htm" title="Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yes, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:">Psalm 83:11</a>). The kind of barbarity here referred to is illustrated by <a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm" title="And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strong holds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.">2Kings 8:12</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/137-8.htm" title="O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewards you as you have served us.">Psalm 137:8-9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled.</span> This was the fruit of their doings, the result of their sins. The tumult of war is already heard, and the work of destruction has begun. The word <span class="accented">shaon</span>, tumult, is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, as applied to the loud rushing of waters, then the tumult of advancing warriors. The preposition <span class="accented">be</span> is rendered <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as above by the Authorized Version, Umbreit, and others; and, joined with "peoples" (which is plural), signifies that the confused noise of war would be heard among their own peoples, or the multitude of the mighty ones in whom they had had such confidence; or the plural may refer to the tribes of Israel, each of which was an <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span>, though Keil would confine this meaning to Pentateuchal times. Host of the versions read the singular, like our own Authorized Version, yet it must still be referred to the people of Israel. But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the preposition is translated "against" by many modern interpreters, and thus the confused noise of the advance of the enemy against Israel is denoted. The attack of the invaders is directed against the <span class="accented">fortresses</span>, or fenced cities, so called from a verb denoting "to cut off" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e6;&#x5d3;</span>), as if all approach to them were cut off, and assault impossible. Nevertheless they were to go down, all of them, before the enemy - laid waste and spoiled; while inhuman cruelty would characterize the conquerors. As an illustration of or specimen resembling that cruelty, an obscure piece of history is quoted. <span class="cmt_word">As Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children</span>. In the great variety of opinion with respect to the event referred to, and the consequent diversity of exposition, we shall not venture to do more than select that which on the whole, notwithstanding a certain chronological difficulty that lies against it, appears the most probable. Accordingly, Beth-arbel may have been Arbela, mentioned in 1 Macc. 9:2 and more than once by Josephus, in Upper Galilee, in the tribe of Naphtali, between Sephoris and Tiberias, now <span class="accented">Irbid</span>; and <span class="accented">Shalman</span> may be an abbreviation for Shal-maneser; while the circumstance here mentioned may have been an incident of the campaign of which we read in <a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3, 5</a>. "Against him came up Shalmaneser King of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant.... Then the King of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years." The manifestation of the cruelty was when the mother, with true motherly affection, bent over her children to defend them, and she and they perished in a common ruin, or when the children were dashed to the ground before their mother's eyes, and she, done to death, hurled upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/10-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the roar of battle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7588.htm">Strong's 7588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A roar (of waters, etcetera), din, crash, uproar</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will rise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
