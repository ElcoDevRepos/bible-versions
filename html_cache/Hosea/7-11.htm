The imagery of a "silly, senseless dove" suggests a lack of wisdom and discernment. Doves are known for their simplicity and vulnerability, which in this context, implies that Ephraim is acting foolishly and without understanding. This behavior reflects Israel's spiritual adultery and lack of faithfulness to God, as they seek alliances with foreign nations instead of relying on the Lord. The dove's senselessness can be seen as a metaphor for Israel's failure to heed the warnings of the prophets and their inability to recognize the consequences of their actions.<p><b>calling out to Egypt,</b><br>Historically, Israel had a complex relationship with Egypt, often looking to it for military and political support. This phrase indicates Israel's reliance on foreign powers rather than trusting in God. Egypt, a symbol of past bondage and idolatry, represents a return to old dependencies and a failure to learn from history. The Israelites' desire to form alliances with Egypt shows their lack of faith in God's provision and protection, echoing the times when they longed to return to Egypt during their wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>).<p><b>then turning to Assyria.</b><br>Assyria was a dominant power during Hosea's time, and Israel's attempts to seek favor with Assyria demonstrate their political instability and spiritual infidelity. This turning to Assyria is ironic, as Assyria would eventually become the instrument of God's judgment against Israel, leading to their exile in 722 BC. The vacillation between Egypt and Assyria highlights Israel's desperation and lack of steadfastness, as they sought security in human alliances rather than in their covenant relationship with God. This behavior is reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where God outlines the consequences of disobedience, including subjugation by foreign nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used synonymously with Israel in the prophetic books.

In this powerful metaphor we have a political allusion. King Hoshea is called <span class= "ital">Ausih</span> on the Assyrian monuments. Having usurped the throne after the murder of Pekah, he "purchased his recognition as king of Israel by giving a large present to the Assyrian monarch" (730 B.C.). (See Geo. Smith, <span class= "ital">Assyria</span>--S.P.C.K.) But while Hoshea was sending tribute to Assyria he was secretly coquetting with Egypt. The alliance between Egypt and the king of Israel, mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2Kings 17:4</a>, took place later, after Tiglath-pileser's death, and led to Israel's ruin. On the other hand, many commentators (Ewald, Nowack, &c.) refer the allusions of this verse to the reign of Menahem.<p><span class= "bld">Without heart.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">without understanding.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart.</span> The silliness of the dove, with which the stupidity of Ephraim is compared, is not manifested by its missing its nest and resting-place, and then helplessly fluttering about, according to Ewald; nor by its falling into the net of the bird-catcher in its effort to escape from the hawk, according to Hitzig; nor by its neither grieving nor searching for its young when it is robbed of them, according to Jerome; nor by its becoming dejected or devoid of consideration when it has lost its young, according to the Targum; but by its flying right into the net of the bird-catcher, without suspecting or observing it in its search for food, according to Rosenm&uuml;ller. Thus Kimchi explains it: "The prophet compares Ephraim to a dove which gets caught in a net owing to its simplicity, because it has no sense to perceive that, when it goes to gather grains of corn, a net is spread there to catch it. So Ephraim, when they went and asked help from Assyria or from Egypt, (did not perceive) that they went to their hurt, when they sought help from the foreign nations and not from God - blessed be he! - in whose hand all is. And he mentions the dove, though it is the manner of other birds, because the dove has no bitterness, as if it went in simplicity and without apprehension of the evil that would come upon it." <span class="cmt_word">They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</span> The position of Palestine exposed its inhabitants to attacks from the two great rival powers of Egypt and Assyria, or Babylon. "It stood midway," says Stanley, "between the two great seats of ancient empire, Babylon and Egypt. It was on the high-road from one to the other of these mighty powers, the prize for which they contended, the battlefield on which they fought, the lofty bridge over which they ascended and descended respectively into the deep basins of the Nile and Euphrates." Accordingly the rulers of the people sought help, now from Egypt to strengthen them against the oppression of Assyria; at another time they sought to secure the support of Assyria. The most powerful enemy of the northern kingdom was Assyria, which distressed that kingdom more and more, until at last they made an end of it. "But," says Kimchi, "while they think to obtain help by them (Egypt and Assyria), they fall into the net of the Almighty - blessed be he - and this is what he says (in the following verse). <span class="cmt_word">As they go I spread my net over them."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/7-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Ephraim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_669.htm">Strong's 669: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ephraim -- a son of Joseph, also his descendants and their territory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has become</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
