The phrase "joined to idols" indicates a deep-seated commitment to idolatry, reflecting a spiritual adultery against God. This idolatry was prevalent in the Northern Kingdom, where the worship of Baal and other Canaanite deities was common. The historical context shows that Israel's kings, starting with Jeroboam I, established idol worship to prevent the people from returning to Jerusalem for worship. This phrase echoes the warnings found in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>, where God commands exclusive worship and warns against idolatry. The spiritual unfaithfulness of Ephraim is a type of the broader unfaithfulness of humanity, contrasting with the faithfulness of Christ, who remained obedient to God.<p><b>leave him alone!</b><br>This command signifies a divine judgment, indicating that God has decided to withdraw His protective presence and allow Ephraim to face the consequences of their choices. It reflects a point of no return, where persistent sin leads to divine abandonment, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-28</a>, where God gives people over to their sinful desires. The cultural context of the time shows that such abandonment would lead to vulnerability to enemy nations, as God's protection was crucial for Israel's survival. This phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of turning away from God, highlighting the need for repentance and foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Christ, who offers reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Ephraim was one of the tribes of Israel, often used to represent the Northern Kingdom as a whole.

Ephraim being the dominant tribe, gave its name to the northern kingdom. The idols were Ephraim's folly, and to that they were wedded; and in consequence they are left to their folly, and at the same time surrendered to their fate. They may persist in their folly; they cannot be prevented. "Give him rest," as the words literally mean, from exhortations and expostulations, from remonstrances and reproofs; he will persist in his folly, prepare for his fate, and perish by his sin. This abandonment of Ephraim proves the desperate nature of his case. Left to his own recklessness, he is rushing towards ruin. Judah is warned to stand aloof from the contagion, lest by interference he might get implicated in the sin and involved in the punishment of Ephraim. The Hebrew commentators express the word rendered "<span class="accented">joined</span> to" in the Authorized Version (ver. 17) by words importing "<span class="accented">yoked</span> to," "allied with," and "<span class="accented">cleaving</span> to."

Aben Ezra: "Let him alone till God shall chastise him; perhaps his eyes shall then open." Kimchi: "Jehovah says to the prophet, Cease to reprove him, for it is of no use ....
