The imagery of a net is often used in the Bible to symbolize entrapment or capture (<a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>, <a href="/job/19-6.htm">Job 19:6</a>). In the context of Hosea, it reflects God's response to Israel's unfaithfulness and idolatry. The net signifies God's inescapable judgment, emphasizing that no matter where the Israelites go, they cannot evade His reach. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of divine justice and accountability.<p><b>I will bring them down like birds of the air.</b><br>The imagery of birds being brought down suggests sudden and decisive action. In ancient Near Eastern culture, birds often symbolized freedom and swiftness. However, here they represent the Israelites' false sense of security and freedom in their idolatrous practices. The phrase indicates that God will humble them, stripping away their perceived autonomy. This can be paralleled with other scriptures where God humbles the proud (<a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>, <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>I will chastise them when I hear them flocking together.</b><br>Chastisement here refers to corrective discipline, a recurring theme in the Bible where God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). The act of flocking together implies a collective rebellion or conspiracy against God, reminiscent of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4-9</a>). This phrase underscores the communal aspect of Israel's sin and God's response to it. The gathering of the people in rebellion is met with divine intervention, highlighting God's attentiveness to the actions and intentions of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who speaks through the prophet Hosea, expressing His intention to discipline Israel for their unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which is being addressed for its rebellion and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message of judgment and hope to Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/net.htm">Net</a></b><br>A metaphor used by God to describe His method of capturing and disciplining Israel, symbolizing inescapable judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assembly.htm">Assembly</a></b><br>Refers to the gathering of the people of Israel who have heard the warnings and teachings of the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control and His judgments are purposeful and just.

He begins by the application of the comparison of Ephraim to a dove. Exactly as a dove in its silliness falls into the net set by the fowler, so Israel runs into the net of destruction in seeking help from Egypt and Assyria. The literal rendering is, according <span class="accented">as they go</span>, or, <span class="accented">whatsoever way they shall go</span>. God threatens to spread a net over them, from which there can be no escape. The chief aim of Hebrew sovereigns and rulers was to defend themselves from Egypt by the help of Assyria, or from Assyria by the aid of Egypt; in either case God threatens to spread over them the net of destruction as the bird-catcher. The application to one or other of these powers God forbade, but when they go to either for relief, the result is sure to prove fatal. The image of a net is frequent in Ezekiel; so in Job, he "hath compassed me with his net." <span class="cmt_word">I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven</span>. The comparison with birds and bird-catching continues. Though their sunward soaring flight be high as the eagle's, or rapid as the soft swift wing of the dove, they cannot outspeed or escape the hand of God, but shall be brought down to earth. Or the idea may be that, swiftly as a bird of prey swoops down out of the free air of heaven upon its quarry on the low-lying earth, Jehovah will bring Israel down out of the air of freedom into the net of captivity. Thus in <a href="/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a> we read, "Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord;" likewise in <a href="/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2</a>, "Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down." <span class="cmt_word">I will chastise them as their congregation hath heard.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> is an anomalous Hiph. instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, that is, <span class="accented">yod</span> mobile instead of <span class="accented">yod</span> quiescent or diphthongal <span class="accented">zere</span>. The literal rendering makes the meaning more obvious; it is: "I will chastise them according to the tidings [or,' announcement '] to their congregation." In the Law and by the prophets it was repeatedly declared that judgments would fall upon the disobedient and rebellions. As specimens of such announcements, we may refer to <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>; and <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15-35</a> The prophet now assures Ephraim that the judgments so frequently and forcibly announced to the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness, and repeated in subsequent times by the prophets, would be executed on the rebellious rigorously, and in exact accordance with those many previous denunciations. Kimchi has the following comment: "I will assemble them through the chastisement of the peoples, as I announced to their assembly in the wilderness words of chastisement, which are written in the Law, if they will not hearken to the words of the Law." The LXX. may have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span>, as their rendering is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "'I will chasten them <span class="accented">with the</span> rumor <span class="accented">of their</span> (coming) <span class="accented">affliction</span>," <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/7-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
