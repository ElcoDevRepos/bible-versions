Throughout the Old Testament, God often speaks directly to prophets, guiding them in their mission. This underscores the prophetic nature of Hosea's ministry, where he acts as a mouthpiece for God's messages to Israel.<p><b>Name him Lo-ammi</b><br>The name "Lo-ammi" means "not my people" in Hebrew. Naming in the Bible often carries significant meaning, reflecting God's message or judgment. This name serves as a symbolic act, representing God's disowning of Israel due to their unfaithfulness. It is a direct continuation of the symbolic actions seen in Hosea's family life, where his children's names convey God's message to Israel.<p><b>for you are not My people</b><br>This phrase reflects a covenantal breach. In the context of the Mosaic Covenant, Israel was chosen as God's people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). However, their persistent idolatry and disobedience led to a severing of this relationship. This statement is a stark declaration of the consequences of Israel's actions, highlighting the seriousness of their spiritual adultery.<p><b>and I am not your God</b><br>This is a reversal of the covenant formula found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>, where God promises, "I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be My people." The breaking of this relationship is profound, indicating a withdrawal of God's protection and blessing. It foreshadows the coming judgment and exile but also sets the stage for future restoration, as seen in later chapters of Hosea and other prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver a message of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lo-ammi.htm">Lo-ammi</a></b><br>The name given to Hosea's son, meaning "not my people" in Hebrew, symbolizing God's rejection of Israel due to their unfaithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which had turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and breaking the covenant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is declaring His judgment through the naming of Hosea's son.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gomer.htm">Gomer</a></b><br>Hosea's wife, whose unfaithfulness serves as a metaphor for Israel's spiritual adultery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_judgment.htm">Understanding God's Judgment</a></b><br><a href="/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a> serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.

That conviction frames everything Hosea records.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Name him Lo-ammi</b><p>- God instructs Hosea to give his son a name that itself preaches. Prophets often used children&#8217;s names as living billboards of divine truth (<a href="/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>- Obedience is immediate and literal&#8212;Hosea will call the boy exactly what God says, no edits, no softening (<a href="/hosea/1-3.htm">Hosea 1:3</a>).<p>- The Lord explains the name on the spot so no one misses the point: it signals a broken relationship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for you are not My people</b><p>- God reverses the covenant formula first spoken at Sinai: &#8220;I will take you as My people&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>). Israel&#8217;s long-running idolatry (<a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12&#8211;13</a>) has reached a tipping point.<p>- This is the covenant&#8217;s penalty clause in action (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15, 63</a>). The Lord is faithful both in blessing and in discipline.<p>- Yet even here a seed of hope lies beneath the judgment; only a verse later God promises, &#8220;In the place where it was said to them, &#8216;You are not My people,&#8217; they will be called sons of the living God&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>; later echoed in <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I am not your God</b><p>- The second half of the covenant formula is also reversed. God withdraws His protective, covenantal presence (<a href="/judges/10-13.htm">Judges 10:13&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20-23</a>).<p>- This does not mean He has changed; rather, Israel has forfeited the privileges of the relationship. Holiness demands separation when sin is cherished.<p>- Even so, Hosea will soon announce restoration: &#8220;Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). Paul later shows the same grace reaching both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a> captures a sobering moment: God Himself instructs Hosea to name his son Lo-ammi as a living declaration that Israel&#8217;s rebellion has severed the covenant bond&#8212;&#8220;you are not My people, and I am not your God.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;And the LORD said&#8221; grounds the statement in divine authority; the naming dramatizes the message; the twin reversals of &#8220;not My people&#8221; and &#8220;not your God&#8221; display the serious consequences of persistent sin. Yet within the same context God foreshadows a future reversal of the reversal, spotlighting His faithful love that ultimately restores all who return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) Closes the chapter in the Hebrew text. The episode above described is, in some particulars, the model for Ezekiel 16. Gomer's child <span class= "ital">Lo 'Ammi</span> (not my people), is type of utter and final repudiation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said God, Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.</span> Here we have the climax of Israel's fate. The prophet's children, whether actual, visionary, or allegorical, symbolized step by step the sad gradation in Israel's fast-coming calamity. The name Jezreel, whether taken to mean their being scattered by God or their suffering the sorrowful consequences of their multiplied delinquencies, m either ease denotes the first blow dealt to them by Divine providence. Bat from that it was possible by repentance to recover; and, though dispersed, they were not beyond the reach of the Divine compassion, nor beyond the power of the Divine arm to collect and bring together again. But <span class="accented">Lo-ruhammah</span>, Unpitied, or Uncompassionated, imports another and a still heavier blow; and, though dispersed far and near, and though left in the places of their dispersion without pity and without compassion, still there might be a good time coming in the near or in the distant future, when a favorable change in their circumstances would be brought about so that they would be both collected together, or comforted and compassionated. The name <span class="accented">Lo-ammi</span>, however, puts an end to hope, implying as it does a total rejection and an entire renunciation of the people of Israel on the part of the Almighty. The national covenant is annulled; God has cast off his people, who are thus left hopeless as helpless, because of their sinful and ungrateful departure from the Source of all mercy and the Fountain of all blessing. The expression of this is very touching: "Ye" says God, now addressing them directly and personally, "are not - are no longer, my people; and I will not be yours." Such is the literal rendering of this now sad but once tender expression - tender, unspeakably tender, as long as applicable; sad, inexpressibly sad, now that its enjoyment is forever gone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
