In the context of Hosea, "mother" symbolizes the nation of Israel, while the children represent the individual Israelites. The call to rebuke reflects the prophetic tradition of calling the people back to covenant faithfulness. This mirrors the role of prophets like Elijah and Jeremiah, who also confronted Israel's idolatry and moral decline.<p><b>for she is not My wife, and I am not her husband</b><br>This metaphor of marriage illustrates the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The language of divorce signifies a broken covenant due to Israel's idolatry and unfaithfulness. In ancient Near Eastern culture, marriage was a binding contract, and infidelity was a grave offense. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a>, where God speaks of giving Israel a certificate of divorce due to her unfaithfulness. The New Testament also uses marriage as a metaphor for the relationship between Christ and the Church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>.<p><b>Let her remove the adultery from her face</b><br>The reference to "adultery" symbolizes Israel's idolatry and alliances with foreign nations, which were seen as spiritual infidelity. The "face" may imply public acts of idolatry or the visible signs of unfaithfulness. In the ancient world, physical adornments could indicate allegiance to certain deities or practices. This call to remove adultery is a call to repentance and purification, similar to the call in <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a> to cleanse one's hands and purify one's heart.<p><b>and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts</b><br>This phrase suggests intimate betrayal, as the "breasts" symbolize the heart or innermost affections. It indicates that Israel's unfaithfulness is deeply rooted and personal. The imagery of the heart being led astray is a common biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which warns to guard the heart. The call to remove unfaithfulness is a call to return to wholehearted devotion to God, reminiscent of the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gomer.htm">Gomer</a></b><br>Hosea's wife, symbolizing Israel's unfaithfulness to God through her adulterous actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as an unfaithful wife in the prophetic literature, representing the people of God who have turned to idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine husband, expressing His covenant relationship with Israel and His desire for their faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/adultery.htm">Adultery</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe Israel's idolatry and unfaithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>God desires a faithful relationship with His people, akin to a marriage covenant.

Let the awakened conscience of the present generation rise up in judgment with the nation as a whole. By "mother" we are to understand the nation Israel, viewed as a collective abstract; and by the "children" (<a href="/hosea/2-4.htm" title="And I will not have mercy on her children; for they be the children of prostitutions.">Hosea 2:4</a>) the inhabitants who are units in the total aggregate. <span class= "ital">Ammi</span> and <span class= "ital">Ruhamah</span> without the negative prefix, show that this awakening of conscience has given them back their privileges.<p>Render, <span class= "ital">That she may put away her whoredoms</span> <span class= "ital">from her face: i.e.,</span> her meretricious guiles, her unblushing idolatry, her voluptuous service of gods that are no God. This strong image was constantly on the lips of the prophets, and had been burned by cruel sorrow into the very heart of Hosea. It acquired portentous meaning in the hideous impurities of the worship of Baal-peor and Ashtoreth, against which the Jehovah worship was a tremendous protest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not thy wife, neither am I her husband.</span> In this second chapter the same cycle of events recurs as in the first, with this difference, that what is expressed by symbol in the one is simply narrated in the other. The cycle is the common one of sin: its usual consequences of suffering and sorrow; then succor and sympathy in case of repentance. The persons addressed in the verse before us are those individuals in Israel who had still retained their integrity, and who, notwithstanding surrounding defection and abounding ungodliness, had continued steadfast in their loyalty and love to the Lord. They might be few in number, widely scattered, perhaps unknown to each other, and of comparatively little note; yet they are here called on to raise their voice in solemn warning and earnest protest against the national defection and wickedness. "<span class="accented">The</span> congregation in its totality, or whole people taken conjointly, is compared to the mother, but individual members to the children, and the sense is that they are to plead with each other to bring them back to the way of goodness" (Kimchi). The nation as such, and in its impiety, is the mother; the pious persons still found in it are here required to testify for God both by exhortation and example. "The congregation of Israel is compared to an adulteress, and the children of the different generations to the children of whoredoms. Before them the prophet <span class="accented">says</span>, 'Plead with your mother'" (Kimchi). Adultery per <span class="accented">se</span> is a virtual dissolution of the marriage-tie; idolatry is spiritual adultery; the close and tender relationship into which God has graciously condescended to take Israel is rendered null and void, and that through Israel's own fault. God threatens the renunciation of it, unless perchance the pleading of the still faithful children might recall the erring mother to penitence and purity. A case the converse of this is that presented in <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>, where the mother's divorce is attributed to the unfaithfulness of the children. "<span class="accented">Where</span>," asks the Lord in that passage, "<span class="accented">is</span> the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away?... for your <span class="accented">transgressions</span> is your mother put away." <span class="accented">Ki</span> before the second clause is either recitative, introducing the words of pleading, or assigns a reason; the latter seems preferable. Let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts. The word <span class="accented">mippaneyha is</span> rather to be rendered "from her face" than "out of her sight." The expression is to be taken literally, as the word "breasts" in the parallel clause proves. Thus Kimchi rightly explains it, saying, "Since he compares her to harlot, he attributes to her the ways of harlots; for the harlot's way is to adorn her face with various kinds of colors, that she may appear fair in the eyes of her paramours." But in addition to ornamenteth as earrings or nose-rings, and other ways of decking herself, as by painting, the expression may imply lascivious looks and wanton expressions of countenance; while the mention of breasts may indicate the making of them bare for the purpose of meretricious blandishments, or as indicating the place of the adulterer (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a> and <a href="/songs/1-13.htm">Song of Solomon 1:13</a>). The Jewish commentators adopt the latter sense. Aben Ezra comments on the grammatical form of the words <span class="accented">teuncha</span> and <span class="accented">naaphupheha</span> (the former by duplication of the second radical, and the latter by that of the third) as intensive; while Rashi and Kimchi refer to the pressure of the breasts. But others understand them figuratively, the countenance indicating boldness, and the breasts shamelessness. Thus Horace speaks of the brilliant beauty (<span class="accented">nixor</span>) and coquettishness (<span class="accented">protervitas</span>) of Glyeera. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Rebuke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7378.htm">Strong's 7378: </a> </span><span class="str2">To toss, grapple, to wrangle, controversy, to defend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your mother,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;im&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
