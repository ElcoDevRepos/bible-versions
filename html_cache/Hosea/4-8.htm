The priests were supposed to guide the people in righteousness, but instead, they benefited from the people's sins. In the sacrificial system, priests received portions of the offerings, and when the people sinned more, more offerings were made, thus increasing the priests' share. This reflects a deep moral decay where spiritual leaders exploit the weaknesses of their flock for personal gain. This situation is reminiscent of the rebuke Jesus gives to the Pharisees in the New Testament, who also exploited religious practices for their own benefit (<a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23:1-36</a>).<p><b>and set their hearts on iniquity</b><br>The phrase indicates a deliberate and willful choice to pursue wrongdoing. The priests not only tolerated sin but actively desired it, as it served their interests. This reflects a heart condition that is far from God, as seen throughout the Bible where the heart is often the center of moral and spiritual life (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). The setting of one's heart on iniquity is a direct violation of the first commandment to love God with all one's heart (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>). This behavior is contrasted with the call to holiness and repentance found throughout the prophetic books, and it foreshadows the ultimate need for a savior who can transform hearts, a role fulfilled by Jesus Christ (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted in Hosea as unfaithful to God, engaging in idolatry and moral corruption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Israel who were responsible for guiding the people in worship and adherence to God's laws but were instead complicit in their sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is grieved by the unfaithfulness of His people and the corruption of their leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_and_iniquity.htm">Sin and Iniquity</a></b><br>The moral and spiritual failings of the people of Israel, which the priests exploit for their gain.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_leadership.htm">The Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders, especially spiritual ones, have a duty to guide people toward righteousness, not exploit their weaknesses.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_complicity.htm">The Danger of Complicity</a></b><br>When leaders indulge in or benefit from the sins of those they lead, they become complicit in those sins.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart's_inclination.htm">The Heart's Inclination</a></b><br>The verse highlights the importance of where we set our hearts.

More sin meant more meat on their tables, so holiness threatened their livelihood.<p>&#8226; Like the sons of Eli who &#8220;treated the LORD&#8217;s offering with contempt&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>), these leaders exploited worship instead of honoring God.<p>&#8226; God had warned shepherds who &#8220;feed themselves&#8221; rather than the flock (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-3</a>). Hosea shows that judgment day has arrived.<p>&#8226; Spiritual leaders today can still profit from brokenness&#8212;selling indulgence, excusing immorality, or turning ministry into commerce&#8212;if they lose sight of the cross. The verse stands as a sober reminder that God sees through religious profiteering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set their hearts on iniquity</b><p>The corruption goes deeper than outward abuse; their affections are twisted.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Set their hearts&#8221; points to deliberate, settled desire. They do not merely tolerate evil, they crave it.<p>&#8226; Their appetite mirrors <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>: calling evil good and good evil; and <a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>: &#8220;The prophets prophesy falsely&#8230; and My people love it so.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/52-3.htm">Psalm 52:3</a> describes the same warped preference: &#8220;You love evil more than good.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a> reveals the final stage&#8212;approving and encouraging sin in others. The priests&#8217; hearts are aligned not with God&#8217;s purity but with the people&#8217;s rebellion, ensuring a mutual spiral downward (<a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; When leaders hunger for what grieves God, the entire community suffers. The antidote is renewed hearts that &#8220;delight in the law of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>) rather than iniquity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/4-8.htm">Hosea 4:8</a> lays bare a chilling reality: Israel&#8217;s priests sustained themselves on the very sins they should have been eradicating, and their deepest affections bent toward further evil. God&#8217;s Word insists that spiritual leaders must never exploit broken people or rejoice in wrongdoing. Instead, they are called to preach repentance, model holiness, and shepherd God&#8217;s flock for His glory, not personal gain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They feed on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#234;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#7789;&#183;&#7789;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2403.htm">Strong's 2403: </a> </span><span class="str2">An offence, its penalty, occasion, sacrifice, expiation, an offender</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of My people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
