The term "hewn" suggests a process of cutting or shaping, akin to a sculptor working with stone. Prophets in Israel, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Hosea himself, were sent to deliver God's messages, often calling the people to repentance. The imagery of hewing implies a forceful and deliberate action, reflecting the seriousness of Israel's sin and the necessity of divine intervention. Prophets were often met with resistance, yet their role was crucial in guiding and correcting the nation.<p><b>I have slain them by the words of My mouth,</b><br>The "words of My mouth" refers to the power and authority of God's spoken word. In biblical context, God's word is living and active, capable of bringing life or executing judgment. This phrase underscores the idea that God's pronouncements through the prophets were not mere warnings but carried the weight of divine decree. The concept of being "slain" by words highlights the spiritual and moral consequences of ignoring God's commands. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of the power of God's word, as seen in creation (Genesis 1) and in the ministry of Jesus, who is described as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and My judgments go forth like lightning.</b><br>Lightning is a symbol of suddenness and power, illustrating the swift and unavoidable nature of God's judgments. In the ancient Near East, lightning was often associated with divine presence and action, as seen in the theophany at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). This imagery conveys the idea that God's judgments are both inevitable and righteous, striking with precision and authority. The comparison to lightning also emphasizes the clarity and visibility of God's actions, leaving no doubt about His sovereignty and justice. This phrase connects to other scriptural references where God's judgment is depicted as swift and decisive, such as in the prophetic books and Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst widespread idolatry and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often characterized by its rebellion against God, idolatry, and social injustice during Hosea's time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers sent by God to deliver His words and warnings to the people.

The sense is, I have slain them by the announcement of deserved doom.<p><span class= "bld">Thy judgments</span> . . .--An error has crept here into the Masoretic text from which the LXX. and other ancient versions are free. The mistake consists in misplacing an initial letter as a final one. Translate, <span class= "ital">My judgment shall go forth as the light,</span> clear, victorious, and beneficent. (Comp. the language of <a href="/psalms/37-6.htm" title="And he shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your judgment as the noonday.">Psalm 37:6</a> and <a href="/context/isaiah/62-1.htm" title="For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burns.">Isaiah 62:1-2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - The consequence of Israel's unsteadiness and inconstancy is here stated. Because of the fluctuating and formal nature of their religiousness, God cut them down (instead of rearing them up) through his prophets by fierce denunciations, and slew them (instead of reviving them) by the Divine word. The judgment of Jehovah went forth as the lightning-fish, or was as clear and conspicuous for justice as the light of day. Neither could outward services expiate their sins, when the proper feelings and meet fruits were absent. <span class="cmt_word">I have hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth.</span> The language is figurative - the first clause seems borrowed from hewing hard wood and shaping it so as to assume the required form; so God dealt with Israel to bring them into shape morally symmetrical, and make them correspond to the character of a holy people. The slaying is metaphorical, and consisted in the denunciation of death and destruction to the impenitent; in this way he killed, but did not make alive. A different rendering of the clause is given by the LXX. and also by Aben Ezra; the former has, "Therefore have I mown down your prophets; I have slain them with the word of my mouth;" the latter has, "The sense is that he slew some of the prophets who misled the people so that they did not turn (repent)." But <span class="accented">be</span> does not imply his hewing in among the prophets; it is instrumental. <span class="cmt_word">And thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.</span> The judgments here spoken of are the Divine judgments denounced against, or inflicted on, the people. Another reading has the pronominal suffix of the first person: "My judgment goeth forth as the light;" to which the Septuagint corresponds: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, equivalent to "my judgment." <span class="accented">I desired mercy</span> (or, <span class="accented">mercy I delight in</span>)... <span class="accented">and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings</span>. The former is the right state of the life, the latter the correct condition of the heart; the former manifests itself in practice, the latter embraces the proper feelings and affections; the former is seen in works of charity and benevolence, the latter consists in right motives and the right relation of the soul to God. The Hebrew form of speech here used denotes inferior importance, not the negation of importance. A similar sentiment occurs in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." Parallel statements are found in <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7-9</a> and Psalm 50:8; also in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. Our Lord cites the first clause of ver. 6 twice - once against Pharisaic ceremonialism (<a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>), and again against rigorous sabbatarianism (<a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>); while there is an allusion to it in <a href="/mark/12-33.htm">Mark 12:33</a>, where love to God and to one's neighbor is declared to be better, or "more than, whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." Sacrifices in themselves, and when offered at the proper time and place, and as the expressions of penitent hearts and pure hands, were acceptable, and could not be otherwise, for God himself had appointed them. But soulless sacrifices offered by men steeped in sin were an abomination to the Lord; it was of such he said, "I cannot away with" them. It is to such that the prophet refers here, as is plain from the following verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have hewn [them]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1433;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;a&#7687;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2672.htm">Strong's 2672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut, carve, to hew, split, square, quarry, engrave</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by the prophets;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ban&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
