This period is marked by moral decay and lawlessness, illustrating Israel's persistent sinfulness. The mention of Gibeah serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, highlighting a pattern of rebellion that has persisted since those days. It underscores the nation's failure to learn from past mistakes and repent.<p><b>and there you have remained</b><br>This phrase suggests that Israel has not progressed spiritually or morally since the time of Gibeah. It implies a stagnation in their relationship with God, as they continue to dwell in sin. The use of "remained" indicates a stubbornness and unwillingness to change, despite the opportunities for repentance and renewal that God has provided throughout their history.<p><b>Did not the battle in Gibeah overtake the sons of iniquity?</b><br>The battle in Gibeah refers to the conflict that arose from the sin committed there, leading to a devastating war between the tribes of Israel. This serves as a warning that sin inevitably leads to judgment and destruction. The "sons of iniquity" are those who persist in their sinful ways, and the rhetorical question emphasizes the certainty of divine retribution.

By saying &#8220;Since the days of Gibeah,&#8221; God points back over four centuries to the very moment Israel&#8217;s moral decay first erupted in public horror. The Lord had treated that atrocity as a warning flare, yet <a href="/hosea/9-9.htm">Hosea 9:9</a> already lamented, &#8220;They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah.&#8221; The implication is clear: nothing has improved. Israel&#8217;s present sins&#8212;idolatry at Bethel (<a href="/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>), injustice (4:2), and political treachery (7:3-7)&#8212;all sprout from that same poisoned root.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you have sinned, O Israel</b><p>&#8226; The charge is national, encompassing priests, kings, and people (<a href="/hosea/4-4.htm">Hosea 4:4-9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a> cries, &#8220;For they have transgressed My covenant,&#8221; linking their guilt to covenant infidelity, not mere social missteps.<p>&#8226; Like <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>, they mix Yahweh&#8217;s name with golden calves, treating blatant rebellion as acceptable worship.<p>God does not soften the verdict; He names it &#8220;sin,&#8221; underscoring personal and collective responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there you have remained</b><p>Israel&#8217;s tragedy is stubborn persistence.

The only escape is wholehearted repentance and renewed covenant fidelity, for He longs to transform &#8220;sons of iniquity&#8221; into children of righteousness (<a href="/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4-7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">O Israel . . . Gibeah.--</span>Thou didst commence thy obscene transgressions long before the disruption of the kingdom of Rehoboam, even at Gibeah. Gibeah is emblematic of gross and cruel sensuality, in allusion to <a href="/judges/19-20.htm" title="And the old man said, Peace be with you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only lodge not in the street.">Judges 19:20</a>, just as Sodom is used for unnatural vice.<p><span class= "bld">There they stood.</span>--Or rather, <span class= "ital">remained</span> sinning after the same manner. The rest of the verse should be rendered, <span class= "ital">Shall there not overtake them in Gibeah</span> (used mystically) <span class= "ital">the war made against the wicked?</span> (Comp. Judges 20) But Dr. Pusey and others take it categorically, implying that though the exterminating war against the men of Gibeah did not overtake them, and has not yet, it shall now, and soon. But the former interpretation is to be preferred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah.</span> Two explanations given of this clause - namely, that which understands, <span class="accented">rain</span> comparatively, that is, "more than" - their sins were greater than those of the Benjamites in the days of Gibeah; and that which refers the sin here spoken of to the appointment of Saul, who was of Gibeah of Benjamin, to be king - must be unhesitatingly rejected. Tile sin of the men of Gibeah was the shameful outrage committed on the Levite's concubine by the men of Gibeah, which with its consequences is recorded in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. and 20. That sin became proverbial, overtopping, as it did, all ordinary iniquities by its shameless atrocity and heinousness. By along-continued course of sin, even from ancient days, Ephraim has been preparing for a fearful doom. <span class="cmt_word">There they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</span> This portion of the verse is not a little perplexing, and in consequence has called forth considerable diversity of exposition. There is <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that which is implied in the Authorized Version, viz. "there they <span class="accented">stood</span>," smitten twice but not destroyed, chastened but not killed, the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them then so as utterly to destroy them, but it shall overtake them now. Or if the verb "overtake," which is future, be strictly rendered, the meaning is - Not a battle like that in Gibeah against the children of iniquity shall overtake them, but one much more sanguinary and terrible, resulting, not in the reduction of a single tribe to six hundred men, but in the extirpation of ten tribes. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That of Keil and others, though not the same, is similar. It is: "There, in Gibea, did they <span class="accented">remain</span>, persevering in the sin of Gibeah, and yet the war in Gibeah against the sinners has not overtaken them." This makes the meaning of the prophet to be that since the days of Gibeah the Israelites persevered in the same or like sin as the Gibeahites; and, though the Gibeahites were so severely punished, actually destroyed, because of their sin, the ten tribes of Israel, persisting in the same or similar sin, have not yet been resisted with any such exterminating war. Jehovah announces his intention now to visit them with punishment and severest chastisement for all. The meaning which Keil aims at may be better brought out by rendering the latter clause interrogatively; thus: "There they stood - persisting in the criminality of Gibeah - shall there not overtake them, living as they do in Gibeah, the war which exterminated the children of crime?" It is admitted that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> may have been the meaning of "persevering;" but a better sense <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is gained by Wunsche referring the subject of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> to the Benjamites; the suffix of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span> to the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, or "children of iniquity," that is, their guilty tribesmen in Gibeah; taking the intermediate clause parenthetically; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> to "stand in defense of;" thus: "Since the days of Gibeah hast thou sinned, O Israel: there they (the Benjamites) stood in defense of the children of iniquity, that the war might not reach them in Gibeah." This gives a satisfactory sense, and intimates that, by a long-continued course of iniquity and crime, the Ephraimites were preparing themselves for a fearful fate. Already from days long gone by grievous guilt cleaved to them; thus in the days of Gibeah they (the Benjamites) stood by their iniquitous brethren that the battle in Gibeah might not reach them. As this was before the disruption, the Benjamites were part and parcel of Israel here represented by them.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/10-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Since the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
