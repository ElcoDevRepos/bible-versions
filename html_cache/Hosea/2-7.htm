In the historical context, Israel often turned to foreign gods and alliances, seeking security and prosperity. The pursuit of "lovers" can be seen as Israel's reliance on idolatry and political alliances with nations like Egypt and Assyria, which ultimately proved futile. This mirrors the futility of seeking fulfillment outside of God's covenant, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a>, where Israel is warned about the consequences of pursuing other gods.<p><b>she will seek them but not find them.</b><br>The inability to find these lovers signifies the emptiness and disappointment that comes from idolatry and turning away from God. This echoes the theme in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>, where all pursuits apart from God are described as "meaningless" and "chasing after the wind." The historical context shows that Israel's alliances and idol worship did not bring the security or prosperity they sought, leading to their downfall and exile.<p><b>Then she will say, &#8216;I will return to my first husband,</b><br>This represents a moment of repentance and realization. The "first husband" is God, who established a covenant relationship with Israel. The imagery of marriage is used throughout the Bible to describe God's relationship with His people, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>. This return signifies a turning back to God, acknowledging Him as the true source of provision and protection.<p><b>for then I was better off than now.&#8217;</b><br>This acknowledgment highlights the blessings and security found in a relationship with God, contrasting with the desolation experienced when Israel strayed. Historically, Israel prospered when they were faithful to God, as seen during the reigns of David and Solomon. This phrase also foreshadows the prodigal son's realization in <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17</a>, where he acknowledges his better state in his father's house. It underscores the theme of redemption and restoration available through repentance and returning to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver a message of repentance and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gomer.htm">Gomer</a></b><br>Hosea's wife, whose unfaithfulness serves as a metaphor for Israel's spiritual adultery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as an unfaithful wife in the book of Hosea, symbolizing the nation's idolatry and abandonment of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lovers.htm">Lovers</a></b><br>Represents the false gods and idols that Israel pursued, forsaking their covenant with Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/first_husband.htm">First Husband</a></b><br>Symbolizes God, whom Israel initially followed before turning to idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Just as Gomer's pursuits were fruitless, so are our pursuits of anything that takes the place of God in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unfailing_love.htm">God's Unfailing Love</a></b><br>Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God remains ready to receive them back, illustrating His enduring love and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_return.htm">Repentance and Return</a></b><br>True repentance involves recognizing the emptiness of our pursuits and returning to God, our first love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_unfaithfulness.htm">Consequences of Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>Spiritual adultery leads to dissatisfaction and loss, reminding us of the importance of faithfulness to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_restoration.htm">Hope for Restoration</a></b><br>No matter how far we stray, there is always hope for restoration when we choose to return to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hosea_2_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hosea 2:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_2_7_Consequences_of_forsaking_God.htm">How does Hosea 2:7 illustrate the consequences of turning away from God?

However eagerly she follows after them - and the form of the verb (Pie! conjugation) expresses that eagerness - she shall only experience the ineffectual nature of her efforts, and feel the impossibility of overtaking the darling objects of her pursuit. However earnestly she seeks them (here the Piel is used again), she shall find every passage barred and every outlet obstructed, so that, unable to find them, she shall be forced to abandon her search as utterly vain and impossible. <span class="cmt_word">Then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</span> The difficulties of her position, the distress in which she found herself, stimulated her to increased eagerness in pursuit of her lovers; but it was only for a brief space, and the efforts were unsuccessful; the means as well as opportunity for the sacrifices and services of idol-worship failed, the obstacles placed in her way were insurmountable. Or, rather, the disappointment was so great and grievous, when all the fondly cherished hopes of help, or succor, or support from those idols were frustrated and found entirely vain, that heartsick and chagrined by unsuccess, she resolves on a change of course. With mingled feelings of remorse and penitence she makes up her mind to retrace her steps. She recalls the better days, the happier time, the more prosperous circumstances, of fidelity to her first and rightful husband and head; and now she is just ready to return to him. She is just now at that stage at which the prodigal in the parable had arrived "when He came to himself," and when he said, "<span class="accented">How</span> many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father."
