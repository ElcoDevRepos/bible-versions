The "it" likely refers to the golden calf idol that was central to the worship in Bethel, a significant religious site in the Northern Kingdom. Historically, Assyria was a dominant empire during Hosea's time, and Israel was under constant threat from it. The "great king" is a reference to the Assyrian monarch, who would demand tribute as a sign of submission and vassalage. This reflects the political reality of the 8th century BC, where smaller nations like Israel often paid tribute to avoid destruction. The carrying away of the idol signifies the futility of Israel's idolatry and their reliance on foreign powers rather than God.<p><b>Ephraim will be seized with shame;</b><br>Ephraim, representing the Northern Kingdom, will experience shame due to their misplaced trust in idols and foreign alliances. The shame is both a personal and national disgrace, as their religious and political failures become evident. Biblically, shame is often associated with sin and the realization of one's wrongdoing. This phrase highlights the prophetic theme of accountability and the consequences of turning away from God. The shame is not just emotional but also a public acknowledgment of their failure to uphold their covenant with God.<p><b>Israel will be ashamed of its wooden idols.</b><br>The wooden idols symbolize the false gods that Israel worshipped, in direct violation of the first and second commandments. This idolatry was a significant issue throughout Israel's history, leading to their downfall. The shame associated with these idols underscores the emptiness and powerlessness of false worship. In biblical theology, idols are often depicted as lifeless and impotent, contrasting with the living God. This phrase serves as a reminder of the prophetic warnings against idolatry found throughout the Old Testament, such as in Isaiah and Jeremiah. The shame of idolatry is a recurring theme, emphasizing the need for repentance and a return to true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used synonymously with Israel in the prophetic books.

Here we have an explanation and confirmation of what has just been said in the preceding verse. The calf, the glorious and magnificent national god, as Israel considered it, is brought to Assyria, and there offered as a present to the Assyrian king. The word <span class="accented">gam</span> is emphatic; that is, "it also," "itself also," or "it also with men and other spoils" - the golden idol of Beth-aven. Kimchi's explanation of <span class="accented">gam</span> is as follows: "Genesis, extension or generalization of the term, refers to the glory he bad mentioned. He says, 'Lo, in its place the glory shall depart from it as soon as they shall break it. <span class="accented">Also</span>, the stump of the calf, namely, the gold thereon, after its form is broken, they shall take away as a present to King Jareb.'" The sign of the accusative with suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span>, which here stands before a passive verb, may be taken either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> absolutely, "<span class="accented">as</span> to it also," "<span class="accented">it</span> shall be brought ;" or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as an instance of anacoluthon; or <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span>, according to Gesenius, the passive may be regarded as an impersonal active, and thus it may take the object of the action in the accusative. The word <span class="accented">yubhal</span> is from <span class="accented">yabhal</span>, primarily used of flowing in a strong and violent stream, and so the root of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, the flood; then it signifies "to go," "to be brought or carried." The <span class="accented">minchah</span> here spoken of cannot well mean tribute, but is rather a gift of homage to the Assyrian conqueror, whom the prophet m vision sees already wasting the land of Israel and carrying away all its treasures and precious things. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span> The feminine form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> - of which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>, the masculine, by analogy, is not in use - is wrongly explained by the Hebrew expositors as having a pleonastic <span class="accented">nun</span>.
