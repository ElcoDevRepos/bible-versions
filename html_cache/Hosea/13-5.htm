The wilderness period was a formative time for the Israelites, where they experienced God's provision and guidance despite their frequent disobedience. The term "knew" implies a deep, covenantal relationship, similar to the use in <a href="/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>, where Adam "knew" Eve, indicating intimacy and personal connection. This reflects God's faithfulness and care, even when the Israelites were unfaithful. The wilderness is often symbolic of testing and reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>, where God led the Israelites to humble and test them.<p><b>in the land of drought</b><br>The "land of drought" refers to the harsh, arid conditions of the Sinai Peninsula, where water and resources were scarce. This environment required the Israelites to depend entirely on God's provision, such as manna from heaven and water from the rock (Exodus 16-17). The drought symbolizes spiritual barrenness and the need for divine intervention. This setting serves as a backdrop for understanding Israel's reliance on God, contrasting with their later prosperity in the Promised Land, which led to spiritual complacency. The imagery of drought is also used in <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-8</a> to contrast those who trust in man versus those who trust in the Lord, emphasizing the importance of faith and dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, whose ministry was to call Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst their idolatry and moral decline.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which had turned away from God to worship idols and engage in sinful practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>Refers to the period of Israel's history when they wandered in the desert after the Exodus from Egypt, a time of testing and reliance on God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_drought.htm">The Land of Drought</a></b><br>Symbolizes a place of scarcity and need, where Israel had to depend on God's provision and guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_knowledge.htm">God's Knowledge</a></b><br>The intimate and caring relationship God had with Israel, knowing them personally and providing for them during their time of need.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_times_of_need.htm">God's Faithfulness in Times of Need</a></b><br>Reflect on how God has been faithful in your own "wilderness" experiences, providing and guiding you through difficult times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Just as Israel was called to rely on God in the wilderness, we are reminded to trust in His provision and guidance in our lives today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembering_god's_past_mercies.htm">Remembering God's Past Mercies</a></b><br>Regularly recall and give thanks for the ways God has sustained you in the past, using these memories to strengthen your faith in present challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forgetting_god.htm">The Danger of Forgetting God</a></b><br>Hosea warns against the complacency that comes when we forget God's past mercies.

The verse urges God&#8217;s people to remember that same faithful provision, repent of self-reliance, and return to wholehearted trust in the One who &#8220;knew&#8221; them when they had nothing but Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I did know thee in the wilderness.</span> The pronoun at the beginning of the verse is emphatic: <span class="accented">As for me</span>; or, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">it was that knew thee</span>. The meaning of the sentiment is: I acknowledged thee with kindness, with paternal care and kind providence watching over thee. "Thou shouldest gratefully acknowledge me," is the comment of Kimchi, "because I knew thee in the wilderness, and cared for thy necessity in the wilderness, in which there were no means of livelihood." <span class="cmt_word">In the land of great drought.</span> The root of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5d1;</span>, unused in Hebrew, but signifying, in Arabic, "to burn, dry, be dry," akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>. Aben Ezra correctly explains it to be "a dry and thirsty laud, and so in the Arabic language; and (that it is so called) on account of all hardships being in it, is the allegorical explanation and not the literal sense." Instead of a lengthened enumeration of all God's loving-kindnesses to Israel at the Exodus and during the desert wanderings, the prophet sums up all in the expressive, "the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt;" and "I it was that did know thee in the wilderness." It is as though he had said, "I pitied thee in the bondage and among the brick-kilns of Egypt; I brought thee forth with a strong hand and outstretched arm; I led thee through the wilderness; I relieved thee in thy straits; I gave thee bread from heaven to satisfy thy hunger, and water from the rock to quench thy thirst; I defended thee from enemies; nor did I relax my care till I gave thee the goodly laud of promise." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/13-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">knew you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the wilderness,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(bam&#183;mi&#7695;&#183;b&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4057.htm">Strong's 4057: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pasture, a desert, speech</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of drought.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1489;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(tal&#183;&#8217;u&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8514.htm">Strong's 8514: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desiccation</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/hosea/13-5.htm">OT Prophets: Hosea 13:5 I knew you in the wilderness (Ho Hs Hos.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/hosea/13-4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Hosea 13:4"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 13:4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/hosea/13-6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Hosea 13:6"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 13:6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
