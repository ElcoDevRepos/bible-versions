The term "rebels" refers to those who have turned away from God's commandments, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption. The word "deep" suggests that their actions are not superficial but entrenched and pervasive. In the historical context of Hosea, Israel was engaged in alliances with foreign nations and worship of their gods, leading to spiritual and physical violence. The "slaughter" can be understood both literally, as in acts of violence and bloodshed, and metaphorically, representing the spiritual death resulting from their apostasy. This echoes the warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience to God leads to curses, including violence and destruction.<p><b>but I will chastise them all.</b><br>Here, God declares His intention to discipline the people. The word "chastise" implies correction and punishment with the aim of bringing about repentance and restoration. This reflects God's justice and mercy, as He does not abandon His people but seeks to correct them. The use of "all" indicates that no one is exempt from this divine discipline, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of God's judgment. This is consistent with the theme of divine retribution found throughout the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>, where God states that He will punish Israel for their iniquities. The chastisement can be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the ultimate chastisement for sin on behalf of humanity, as described in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel to repentance and warning of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to in Hosea as Ephraim, which had turned away from God and engaged in idolatry and other sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebels.htm">Rebels</a></b><br>Refers to those in Israel who have turned away from God, engaging in sinful practices and leading others astray.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/slaughter.htm">Slaughter</a></b><br>This term indicates the depth of Israel's sin, possibly referring to both literal violence and spiritual corruption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/chastisement.htm">Chastisement</a></b><br>God's corrective discipline intended to bring Israel back to righteousness and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_depth_of_sin.htm">The Depth of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just a surface issue; it can be deeply ingrained in individuals and societies.

Here, &#8220;the rebels&#8221; points to priests, princes, and people who have willfully turned from covenant faithfulness.<p>- The word paints a picture of stubborn resistance, like Israel in <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>, &#8220;Sons I raised and reared, but they have rebelled against Me&#8221;.<p>- Their rebellion is not ignorance but deliberate: see <a href="/jeremiah/2-29.htm">Jeremiah 2:29</a>, &#8220;Why do you bring charges against Me? You have all rebelled against Me&#8221;.<p>- The text reminds us that sin begins in the heart before it ever shows up in actions (cf. <a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a>). God names them &#8220;rebels&#8221; so they will see their true identity apart from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are deep in slaughter</b><p>- &#8220;Deep&#8221; pictures something buried or entrenched.

He will not overlook entrenched rebellion.<p>- &#8220;Chastise&#8221; carries the idea of corrective discipline, not annihilation. <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a> reminds, &#8220;Do not despise the LORD&#8217;s discipline&#8230;because the LORD disciplines the one He loves&#8221;.<p>- Hosea has already described coming discipline: exile (<a href="/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>), withdrawal of His presence (<a href="/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>), and national collapse (<a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4-5</a>). This verse re-affirms that every rebel, from priest to peasant, will face that discipline.<p>- <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a> applies the same principle to believers today: God&#8217;s chastening is proof of son-ship, designed to restore rather than merely punish.<p>- The promise of chastisement also carries hope: once discipline has done its work, God will heal and revive (<a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/5-2.htm">Hosea 5:2</a> exposes a people stubborn in heart, immersed in violent, idolatrous practices, and headed for certain divine discipline.

The verse warns that hidden sin quickly becomes deep-seated, yet it also comforts: the LORD loves His people enough to confront and correct, aiming to restore them to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Are profound to make slaughter.--</span>Ewald, followed recently by Nowack, is right in interpreting the Heb. text as meaning, "The apostates have gone deep in iniquity." In the last clause the Authorised version is again incorrect.

The literal rendering of the first clause is, <span class="accented">slaughtering they have made deep</span>, which is an idiom analogous to "they have deeply revolted;" literally, "they have made revolting deep" (<a href="/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>). The slaughtering, though understood by Wunsche of sacrifices, is rather meant of the destruction and carnage which the revolters caused to the people. Rashi explains it literally in this way: "I said, Every one that goes not up to the stated feasts transgresses a positive precept; but they decree that every one who goes up to the stated feasts shall be slain." This seems to imply that liers-in-wait were set probably on Mizpah and Tabor, the places mentioned in the preceding verse, to slay the Israelites that were found going up to the feasts at Jerusalem. Aben Ezra, taking this second verse as continuing the sentiment of the first, interprets as follows: "Ye have been a snare on Mizpah that ye might not allow them to go up to the feasts to the house of the Lord; and to slay (victims) in the usual way." The revolters or apostates he takes to be the worshippers of Baal. "<span class="accented">They</span> made deep," he adds in his exposition, "the snares, those that are mentioned, that passers-by might not see them; but I will chastise all of them for this evil which they have done, since it is not hidden from me why they have hid (made) it so deep." The slaughtering is thus understood by Aben Ezra of slaying the sacrificial victims. Similarly Kimchi interprets thus: "He says that the revolters who are the worshippers of idols, who depart from the ways of God - blessed be he! - and kern his service, like a woman who is a revolter from under her husband, have made deep their revolt, slaying and sacrificing to idols." lie would understand the slaughtering neither of victims with Kimchi and Aben Ezra; nor of literally slaying Israelites to prevent persons going up to Jerusalem, the proper seat of Jehovah's worship; but of the destructive consequences which the conduct of these apostates brought on the people. The work of chastisement God now takes in hand in good earnest. Droppings of the coming shower there had been; but now the full flood is to descend, for God presents himself to misleaders and misled alike under the sole aspect of rebuke. "I," he says, "am chastisement" (give myself to it). A like form of expression occurs in <a href="/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> am prayer;" that is, am a man of prayer, or give royal. If to prayer. Thus Kimchi explains the idiom: "<span class="accented">The</span> prophet says, Say not that no man shall correct and reprove them, therefore they sin; for I am the person who reproves them all, and day by day I reprove them, but they will not hearken to me.
