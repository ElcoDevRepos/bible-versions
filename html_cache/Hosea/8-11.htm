The multiplication of altars indicates a proliferation of idolatrous worship practices, contrary to the commandment to worship Yahweh alone. This reflects a period of spiritual decline and syncretism, where the Israelites adopted pagan practices from surrounding nations. The altars were intended for sacrifices, but instead of being used for worshiping God, they became places of sin. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>, where Jeroboam set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan, leading Israel into sin.<p><b>they became his altars for sinning</b><br>The altars, instead of serving their intended purpose of atonement and worship, became instruments of sin. This highlights the irony and tragedy of Israel's spiritual state. The altars, meant to bring the people closer to God, instead facilitated their rebellion against Him. This is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>, where God expresses His disdain for sacrifices offered without true repentance. The misuse of altars underscores the theme of empty ritualism versus genuine faith, a recurring issue in the prophetic literature. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who would fulfill the law and provide a means for true atonement, contrasting with the ineffective sacrifices of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the Northern Kingdom of Israel, often used synonymously with Israel in the prophetic books.

By building many altars, Ephraim ignored that clear command.<p>&#8226; The very increase of religious structures exposed a deeper problem: trust in human invention instead of obedience. Jeroboam&#8217;s earlier introduction of golden calves at Dan and Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-31</a>) set the pattern; subsequent leaders merely multiplied what God never wanted.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13-14 and 10</a>:1, the prophet had already warned that Israel&#8217;s altars on every high hill were born of pride and spiritual adultery, not devotion. What looked like zeal was actually rebellion.<p>&#8226; Takeaway: visible religious activity, if detached from heartfelt submission to God&#8217;s Word, does not please Him (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They became his altars for sinning</b><p>&#8226; The intended purpose&#8212;atonement&#8212;was reversed. The more Ephraim built, the more he sinned.

Instead of stopping sin, the altars institutionalized it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a> notes that &#8220;altars&#8230; are like piles of stones on a plowed field.&#8221; Stones that should mark boundaries of covenant faithfulness now clutter the landscape as monuments to disobedience.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;became his altars for sinning&#8221; shows personal ownership: Ephraim embraced his own downfall. The result was inevitable judgment (<a href="/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>) because sin covered by religion is still sin.<p>&#8226; Application for believers today: multiplying programs, symbols, or buildings cannot substitute for repentance and obedience.

Ephraim&#8217;s surge of altars, meant to deal with sin, only deepened sin because they defied God&#8217;s revealed pattern. More religion did not mean more righteousness; it magnified rebellion. True worship flows from obedience to Scripture&#8212;one heart, one altar, one Savior&#8212;rather than from multiplying outward forms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Many altars.</span>--Multiplication of altars was condemned in the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm" title="But to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and thither you shall come:">Deuteronomy 12:5</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The narrative in Joshua 22 shows that unity of altar and sanctuary was essential to the unity of the nation.

In the first clause sin equals transgression, in the last transgression <span class= "ital">plus</span> guilt and peril.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - These two verses are closely connected with the preceding verse and with each other. Ver. 11 not only accounts for, but justifies, the threat of punishment announced in ver. 10 by reference to Ephraim's sin; and ver. 12 shows the inexcusableness of Ephraim in thus sinning. <span class="cmt_word">Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</span> Instead of the one sanctuary with its altar in the place which the Lord their God would choose out of all their tribes to put his Name there and to accept the offerings of his people, they multiplied altars contrary to the express command of God; while those altars which they erected in any places that pleased them were not for the service of the true God, but for the worship of idols, the calves, Baal, and ether vanities of the heathen. Thus they multiplied their sin by every altar they reared and every idol they worshipped. Their altars, instead of proving their piety, plunged them in greater sin and deeper guilt. <span class="cmt_word">I have written to him the great things of my Law,</span> but they <span class="cmt_word">were counted as a strange thing.</span> For the Athenians, whose city Paul found full of idols, and which in addition to its many other altars had one to an unknown god, there was some excuse, for they were not privileged with a revelation of the Divine will in a written Law; but for Israel no such apology was possible. This verse proves plainly that, in their sinning by multiplying idols and altars, they were entirely without excuse. The kethie or textual reading has <span class="accented">ribbo</span> for <span class="accented">ribboth</span> by the omission of tar and equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, that is, ten thousand, or myriads; the Qeri or Maasoretie correction, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d1;</span>, multitudes. The idea conveyed is the numerous directions, preceptive and prohibitive, of the Pentateuch; the commandments, so full and explicit, comprehending alike the great things and the little; the details, so minute as well as manifold, that there was no possibility of mistake, provided there was any mind to be informed. Still more, these commandments, directions, and details were not only communicated verbally and orally to Israel; they were committed to writing, and thus placed permanently on record. And yet, notwithstanding all this, the great things of God's Law were regarded by many or most of those to whom they were addressed as instructions foreign to their interest, with which they had no concern, and which consequently had no claim on their attention and deserved no place in their recollection. The variety of names for the Divine commands is very noteworthy. There are <span class="accented">commandments</span> equivalent to all precepts of which the motives are assigned, as of circumstance to distinguish Israel from ether people; <span class="accented">statutes</span>, for which no motives are assigned, as in the case of the red heifer, prohibition against wearing garments of mixed material, and ceremonial prescripts in general; <span class="accented">testimonies</span>, precepts intended to keep up the memory of any event of fact as the Passover to remind of the departure from Egypt; <span class="accented">precepts</span>, rational injunctions, left, so to say, to our intelligence, as the unity of the Deity and the fact of his being the Creator; and <span class="accented">judgments</span>, judicial directions relating to buying and selling, inheritances, and such like. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/8-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Though</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ephraim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_669.htm">Strong's 669: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ephraim -- a son of Joseph, also his descendants and their territory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">multiplied</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hir&#183;b&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7235.htm">Strong's 7235: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become much, many or great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the altars</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(miz&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4196.htm">Strong's 4196: </a> </span><span class="str2">An altar</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for sin,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1496;&#1465;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7789;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
