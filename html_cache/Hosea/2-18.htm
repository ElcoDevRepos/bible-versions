In biblical prophecy, "that day" frequently points to a time when God will intervene decisively in human history. It suggests a period of fulfillment and divine action, aligning with eschatological themes found throughout the prophets.<p><b>I will make a covenant for them</b><br>The concept of a covenant is central to the biblical narrative, representing a solemn agreement initiated by God. This new covenant echoes the promises made to Noah, Abraham, and Israel, but it extends beyond human relationships to include all creation. It signifies God's commitment to restore harmony and order, reminiscent of the peace in Eden before the fall.<p><b>with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that crawl on the ground</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive scope of God's covenant, encompassing all living creatures. It reflects the original harmony between humanity and nature as seen in Genesis. The inclusion of animals suggests a return to a state of peace and balance, where creation is no longer subject to the curse of sin. This imagery is also found in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, where the peaceable kingdom is described.<p><b>And I will abolish bow and sword and battle in the land</b><br>The abolition of weapons and warfare signifies the establishment of peace and security. This promise aligns with prophetic visions of a future where nations will no longer engage in war, as seen in <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a> and <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>. It points to a divine intervention that brings an end to human conflict, reflecting the ultimate peace brought by the reign of the Messiah.<p><b>and will make them lie down in safety</b><br>This phrase conveys a sense of security and rest, reminiscent of the shepherd imagery found in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>. It suggests a time when God's people will experience true peace and protection, free from fear and danger. The promise of safety is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's covenantal promises and the restoration of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons /

Jesus noted that not a sparrow falls apart from the Father (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>); under the coming covenant, the Creator&#8217;s care will be visibly restored so that every winged creature benefits from renewed peace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the creatures that crawl on the ground</b><p>Nothing is too small for God&#8217;s redemptive plan. <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-22</a> teaches that &#8220;creation waits in eager expectation&#8221; for this liberation.
