Historically, Israel sought help from surrounding nations like Assyria and Egypt, which weakened their reliance on God. This is reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where God cautions Israel about the dangers of turning to other nations instead of trusting Him. The consumption of strength symbolizes the gradual erosion of Israel's power and vitality due to these alliances, reflecting a spiritual decline as well.<p><b>but he does not notice</b><br>This indicates Israel's spiritual blindness and lack of awareness regarding their deteriorating condition. The nation was oblivious to the fact that their strength was being sapped by their reliance on foreign powers. This mirrors the spiritual complacency warned against in <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>, where the church in Laodicea is described as being unaware of its true spiritual state. The lack of awareness is a call to self-examination and repentance, urging believers to recognize their dependence on God.<p><b>Even his hair is streaked with gray</b><br>Gray hair in biblical times was often associated with wisdom and experience, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>. However, in this context, it symbolizes the unnoticed aging and decline of the nation. The imagery suggests that Israel is past its prime, yet remains unaware of its vulnerability and impending judgment. This serves as a metaphor for spiritual decline, where outward signs of decay are ignored, leading to further deterioration.<p><b>but he does not know</b><br>This phrase underscores the theme of ignorance and denial. Israel's failure to recognize its weakened state is a result of spiritual insensitivity and pride. This ignorance is a recurring theme in the prophets, where the people are often described as having eyes but not seeing, and ears but not hearing, as in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>. The call is for awareness and repentance, urging the nation to return to God before it's too late.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst widespread idolatry and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which was experiencing political instability and spiritual decline during Hosea's time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding nations and influences that were leading Israel away from their covenant with God, both politically and spiritually.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gray_hair.htm">Gray Hair</a></b><br>Symbolic of aging and decline, representing Israel's unnoticed spiritual and moral decay.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The overarching theme of Hosea, where God warns Israel of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness and calls them to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_awareness.htm">Spiritual Awareness</a></b><br>Just as Israel was unaware of its decline, Christians must remain vigilant and aware of their spiritual health to avoid gradual decay.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/influence_of_the_world.htm">Influence of the World</a></b><br>The "foreigners" consuming Israel's strength can be likened to worldly influences that can erode a believer's faith if not guarded against.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/signs_of_decline.htm">Signs of Decline</a></b><br>The gray hair symbolizes unnoticed decline.

Both Egypt and Assyria had come to regard Israel as the earthen pipkin between iron pots. These strangers have devoured his strength--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> he has less power to resist aggression, less treasure, less land, smaller population. The signs of senility are upon him. "Grey hairs are his passing bell." He is under sentence of death, and knoweth it not.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not.</span> Israel's intercourse with other nationalities could not but issue in disaster; a specimen of that disaster is here given. As the Greeks called all who did not speak the Greek language, whether they were savage or civilized, barbarians, so Israel called all foreigners, whether near or far off, strangers. The foreign nations here meant were those with which Israel had entered into treaties or formed alliances, in contravention of the constitution which God had given them. These nations, moreover, devoured their national resources by the imposition of taxes and hostile incursions; thus the King of Syria left "of the people to Jehoahaz only fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the King of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing;" again, when "Pul, the King of Assyria, came against the laud," we read that Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the King of Assyria;" then, "in the days of Pekah King of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazer, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. "The <span class="accented">strength</span> here mentioned includes all those things which constitute the wealth and well-being of a country, the produce of the soil and the riches of its inhabitants. Thus Aben Ezra rightly explains this clause, referring it to "the tribute which the Israelites gave to Assyria and Egypt, as is written in the Book of Kings." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, grey hairs are here and there</span> (margin, <span class="accented">sprinkled</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>upon him</span>. What from foreign foes and internal feuds, the body politic was manifesting unmistakable symptoms of decay and decrepitude and approaching dissolution, just as grey hairs on the human body give indication of the advance of old age, with its decay of strength and nearness to the tomb. "The course of nature," says Aben Ezra, "has sprinkled grey hairs upon him, just as grey hair comes on men in consequence of the course of nature;" this corresponds to the sentiment of the preceding clause, for, according to the commentator just named," the grey hair denotes that their power is weakened and their possession perished." <span class="cmt_word">Yet he knoweth not is parallel to</span>. "And he knoweth (it) not," and repeats the same sentiment, of course with emphasis of what was Israel thus ignorant? Not, surely, of the declining state of the national strength and the decay of the national importance. After so many drains upon their resources and the unsatisfactory position of their foreign relations, they could not shut their eyes upon the steadily and even rapidly approaching decadence. But though they could not pretend ignorance of the fact, they remained in ignorance of the cause, its consequence, and the cure. Notwithstanding the already exhausted condition of their country, and the process of exhaustion still going on, they overlooked the lamentable cause of all, which was their sin, national and individual, in departing from the Lord; and at the same time the dangerous consequences that were neither remote nor capable of being staved off; as also the only possible cure to be found in direct and immediate return and application to that God from whom they had so revolted. The "it" supplied in the Authorized Version <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> had better be omitted; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the construction adopted by Rashi and others, who make the first part of each clause the object of the second, is erroneous, as we have shown in the preceding observations. "They took it not to heart that the kings of Syria consumed them in the days of Jehoahaz" is the exposition of Rashi just referred to; but that of Kimchi favors the first and correct construction, as may be inferred from the words, "And he (Israel) knows not that on account of his iniquity all this has come upon him, and yet he turns not from his wickedness." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/7-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Foreigners</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2114.htm">Strong's 2114: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn aside, to be a, foreigner, strange, profane, to commit adultery</span><br /><br /><span class="word">consume</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his strength,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
