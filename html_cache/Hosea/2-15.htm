Vineyards in ancient Israel were a symbol of prosperity and abundance. The promise to "give back her vineyards" indicates a reversal of judgment and a return to favor. In the context of Hosea, Israel had been unfaithful, likened to an adulterous wife, and had lost her blessings due to idolatry and disobedience. The restoration of vineyards symbolizes God's grace and willingness to forgive and restore His people. This echoes the covenant blessings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>, where obedience leads to prosperity.<p><b>and make the Valley of Achor into a gateway of hope</b><br>The Valley of Achor, meaning "trouble," was the site of Achan's sin and subsequent punishment (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-26</a>). It was a place associated with judgment and trouble. Transforming it into a "gateway of hope" signifies a profound change from a place of despair to one of new beginnings and opportunities. This transformation is a powerful image of redemption and renewal, reflecting God's ability to turn situations of judgment into opportunities for hope and restoration. It also prefigures the ultimate redemption found in Christ, who turns our places of sin and judgment into paths of hope and salvation.<p><b>There she will respond as she did in the days of her youth</b><br>This phrase refers to Israel's early relationship with God, particularly during the Exodus and the wilderness period, when the nation was newly formed and dependent on God. It suggests a return to a pure and devoted relationship, reminiscent of a bride's early love for her husband. This imagery is consistent with <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>, where God recalls the devotion of Israel's youth. It highlights the theme of renewal and the possibility of returning to a state of faithfulness and love.<p><b>as in the day she came up out of Egypt</b><br>The reference to coming up out of Egypt recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history where God delivered His people from slavery. This event is a type of salvation and deliverance, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. It signifies liberation, new beginnings, and the establishment of a covenant relationship with God. By invoking this imagery, the text emphasizes God's power to save and His desire to renew the covenant relationship with His people, offering them a fresh start and a hopeful future.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as an unfaithful wife in Hosea, symbolizing the nation's spiritual adultery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_achor.htm">Valley of Achor</a></b><br>A place of trouble and judgment in Israel's history, associated with Achan's sin (Joshua 7), but here transformed into a symbol of hope.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyards.htm">Vineyards</a></b><br>Symbolic of prosperity and blessing, representing God's restoration and provision for Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus_from_egypt.htm">Exodus from Egypt</a></b><br>A foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and new beginnings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_from_judgment_to_hope.htm">Transformation from Judgment to Hope</a></b><br>God can transform places of past trouble into gateways of hope.

Friendly doings as well as sayings are embraced in the Divine goodness, and manifest the Divine mercy. On emerging from the wilderness, fruitful vineyards, such as Sibmah, Heshbon, and Elea-leh, east of Jordan. and fertile valleys, like that of Aehor near Jericho, to the west of Jordan, as coon as they have crossed the river, shall be given them. These vineyards and valleys would thus be the first installments of God's promise, and a prelude to the possession of the whole, so <span class="accented">that</span> the door of hopeful expectation and of joyful anticipation would be thrown wide open to them. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> has three meanings - "humble one's self.... answer," "sing." Hence the LXX. and older interpreters adopt <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: Calvin, "respondent;" and Aben Ezra and Kimchi, "she shall sing and play." The last deserves the preference. No wonder if', under such circumstances, Israel responded with songs of praise and thanksgiving, as in that early day of the nation's youth, when, coming up out of Egypt, they sang the song of Moses by the Red Sea's margin, while Miriam and the maidens of Israel in full chorus completed the harmony. Now, all these experiences of the past were to repeat themselves in the future history of Israel. Their past captivity or dispersion was obviously implied in this promised deliverance and God's gracious dealings with them in the future. There is a different explanation of one expression in this verse, which deserves careful consideration - an explanation which turns on what once transpired in that valley, and the meaning of the name of it, <span class="accented">troubling</span>, derived flora that transaction; we refer, of course, to the affair of Achan. The punishment of the transgressor in that case, and the putting away of sin in connection with penitence and prayer, reopened, after defeat, the door of hope, and restored the enjoyment of Divine help. The discomfiture that so troubled the host of Israel was immediately followed by the victory at At, which inspired them with the hope of soon possessing the whole land. So with Israel after the captivity - a dreary night of weeping was followed by a bright and blessed morning. So, too, in time to come, when, after a long and sorrowful expectation, Israel shall return from the lands of their exile to their fatherland, or by faith and repentance to the paternal God, the light of better and more hopeful days shall (lawn upon them. To the idea of troubling Kimchi attaches the notion of <span class="accented">purification</span>, quoting with approval Rashi and Aben Ezra to the same purpose. His comment is: "Because at the beginning, when they went into the land in the days of Joshua, this misadventure befell them, namely, the matter of Achan, he gave them confidence that they should not fear when they assembled in the land, and that no misadventure would occur to them, as they would all be refined and purified because, in the wilderness of the peoples, they would be purified. And that valley of Achor shall no more be called so, for its name is for depreciation; but a name of honor shall be given to it, and it is a door of hope. And inasmuch as he says 'door,' and not 'valley,' as it should be, it is because it shall be to them as a door, since from there they shall enter into the land as they did at the first, and it shall be to them hope and the aim of what is good; consequently they call it the door of hope. And the sage Rabbi Abraham explains the valley of Achor to be the valley of Jezreel, viz.' because I [Jehovah] troubled her there, it will turn to a door of hope.' And R.S.I. (Rashi) of blessed memory explains it as the depth of the exile, where they were troubled; so 'I will give her a door of hope, the beginning of hope, that out of the midst of those troubles I will give her a heart to return to me.'" To the same purpose he quotes a brief comment of Saadia Gaon. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, cognate with Arabic karma, to be noble, equivalent to "the more fruitful and productive." The word <span class="accented">mishsham</span> is, according to some, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> an expression of time, equivalent to "from the time of their departure from the desert," - so Keil; others explain it as <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "thereout," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "I will make their vineyards out of it," - so Simson; and ethers, again, explain it "from there or thence." It is taken in the last-mentioned sense by Kimchi, as follows: "From the wilderness I will give the whole land, which she formerly possessed, as if he said, 'I will constitute her there in the wilderness to do good to her in her land,' because that in the wilderness of the peoples he will purify them and consume the rebellious and the transgressors, so that the remainder shall fear (or flock reverently to him). Consequently they shall need consolations, and be shall speak to their heart. Because God - blessed be he! - shall give them their land as at the first; therefore he says, 'And I will speak to their heart.' And although we have explained that the consolations shall spring out of the distress which they endured in exile, yet will the whole be as well for the one (viz. the consolation) as for the other (the trouble)." It is aptly remarked by Aben Ezra, in relation to the vineyards, that "the words form a contrast to the other words of the prophet, 'And I will destroy their vine;'" likewise Kimchi asking, "And why has the prophet only mentioned their vineyards (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when purposing to give them the whole land)? Because he had mentioned in their punishment, 'I will destroy her vines,' he mentions in the promised consolation her vineyards." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
