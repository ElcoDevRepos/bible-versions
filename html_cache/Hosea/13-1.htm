The name "Ephraim" often symbolizes the entire northern kingdom due to its prominence. The phrase indicates a time when Ephraim's words commanded respect and fear, suggesting a period of political and military strength. This reflects the tribe's leadership role and its ability to influence other tribes and nations. The trembling signifies the authority and respect Ephraim held, possibly during the reigns of powerful kings like Jeroboam II.<p><b>he was exalted in Israel.</b><br>Ephraim's exaltation refers to its elevated status among the tribes of Israel. Historically, Ephraim was a leading tribe, often taking precedence in matters of national importance. This exaltation can be linked to its strategic location, fertile land, and significant population. The tribe's prominence is also seen in its association with key biblical figures, such as Joshua, who was an Ephraimite. This status, however, was not just political but also spiritual, as Ephraim was expected to lead in faithfulness to God.<p><b>But he incurred guilt through Baal,</b><br>The mention of Baal highlights the idolatry that plagued Israel. Baal worship was a significant issue, as it involved practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh. This idolatry led to moral and spiritual decline, as the Israelites adopted pagan rituals and beliefs. The guilt incurred through Baal indicates a turning away from God, violating the covenant relationship established at Sinai. This apostasy was a recurring theme in Israel's history, leading to prophetic warnings and eventual judgment.<p><b>and he died.</b><br>The death mentioned here is symbolic of spiritual death and the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom. This phrase foreshadows the Assyrian conquest and the exile of Israel in 722 BC. The spiritual death resulted from persistent idolatry and disobedience, leading to God's judgment. This serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God. Theologically, it underscores the principle that sin leads to death, both physically and spiritually, echoing the broader biblical narrative of sin and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Ephraim was one of the tribes of Israel, often representing the Northern Kingdom as a whole.

This idea and that of the previous verse (<a href="/hosea/12-14.htm" title="Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood on him, and his reproach shall his LORD return to him.">Hosea 12:14</a>) may have been brought into prominence by the recent untoward antagonism aroused by the Syro-Ephraimitish war against Judah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel.</span> This rendering of the Authorized Version <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is supported by the Syriac, which is: "When Ephraim spake trembling, then he was, and was great in Israel." Rashi has a similar rendering of the word <span class="accented">retheth</span>, which is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and causes the diversity of translation in this clause; but his exposition of the whole sentence is vague and unsatisfactory. Referring it to Jeroboam of the tribe of Ephraim, he explains as follows: "When Jeroboam, zealous for God, spoke against Solomon hard words, and with terror, Solomon was a great king." Pococke's exposition is in harmony with the Authorized Version, and is the following: "When Ephraim spake with fear and trembling (like his forefather Jacob, in his humble supplication to God), he exalted himself in Israel." But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the rendering adopted by most moderns, is decidedly preferable, as agreeing better with the context, and much more in bar-runny with tribal characteristics of Ephraim, as intimated in this very book, and exhibited elsewhere. The translation we thus prefer is: "When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he, even he, exalted himself in Israel." Such was the fear inspired, and the deference paid to the authority of that powerful tribe. The word <span class="accented">reheth</span>, though not found elsewhere, has a cognate root in Aramaic, with the meaning here assigned to it; for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> is to fear, shudder, tremble; there is also, in <a href="/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>, equivalent to "fear," similar in both sense and sound. The Chaldee supports this rendering; its paraphrase is: "When one of the house of Ephraim spake, trembling seized the peoples." Also Aben Ezra and Kimchi. The former's brief comment is: "Before his speaking the peoples were afraid; and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> has no analogue except in the Aramaic." Kimchi's explanation is, "From the beginning, before Ephraim sinned, the fear of him was great over the peoples who surrounded him; for when he spake, fear and trembling were wont to seize him who heard him; and he was great and strong among the tribes of Israel, as it was said of him, ' And his seed shall be a multitude of nations.'" <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. renders <span class="accented">reheth</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, thus:" According to the word of Ephraim, be adopted ordinances for himself in Israel," that is, when Ephraim spoke, the rest of the Israelites assented to his ordinances and rights, reverencing his authority, so that the general sense differs little from the Chaldee.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Ephraim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_669.htm">Strong's 669: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ephraim -- a son of Joseph, also his descendants and their territory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">spoke,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
