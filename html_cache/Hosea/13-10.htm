Historically, Israel demanded a king to be like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>), rejecting God as their true King. This question underscores the failure of earthly kings to provide ultimate security and salvation, contrasting with God's sovereign rule.<p><b>to save you in all your cities</b><br>The mention of "all your cities" emphasizes the widespread nature of Israel's reliance on human rulers. It suggests that the entire nation, not just isolated areas, had turned to kings for deliverance. This reflects the historical context of Israel's political instability and the frequent threats from surrounding nations. The inability of kings to save the cities points to the limitations of human power compared to God's omnipotence.<p><b>and the rulers to whom you said</b><br>This phrase recalls the people's demand for a king and leaders, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/8-19.htm">1 Samuel 8:19-20</a>, where the Israelites insisted on having a king to lead them and fight their battles. It highlights the people's misplaced trust in human authority rather than in God. The rulers, including judges and princes, were often seen as intermediaries between God and the people, yet they frequently led Israel astray.<p><b>&#8220;Give me a king and princes&#8221;?</b><br>This request echoes the historical moment when Israel asked for a king, leading to the anointing of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/8-6.htm">1 Samuel 8:6-7</a>). It signifies a rejection of God's direct rule and a desire to conform to the political structures of surrounding nations. The demand for "princes" indicates a desire for a structured hierarchy, yet it often resulted in corruption and idolatry. This longing for human leadership foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, who perfectly embodies the role of a righteous and eternal ruler.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst their idolatry and political alliances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often characterized by its rebellion against God, idolatry, and reliance on political alliances rather than divine guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_and_princes.htm">Kings and Princes</a></b><br>Refers to the human leaders Israel sought after, rejecting God's kingship in favor of earthly rulers, which led to their downfall.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who desires to be the true King and ruler over Israel, highlighting their misplaced trust in human leadership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_israel.htm">Cities of Israel</a></b><br>Represents the various locations within the Northern Kingdom where the people sought security and salvation through human governance rather than divine protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_misplaced_trust.htm">The Danger of Misplaced Trust</a></b><br>Trusting in human leaders or systems over God leads to disappointment and failure.

The verse invites every reader to shift confidence from fragile structures to the Sovereign King who never fails and who, in Christ, provides the perfect, everlasting rule our hearts were made to desire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) The rendering should be,<span class= "ital"> Where, pray, is thy king, that he may save thee?</span> &c. The original demand for a king who should be a visible token to Israel of protection against their surrounding foes was adverse to the true spirit of the kingdom of God upon earth, and, though granted, proved to the united kingdom, and afterwards to the kingdom of Israel, an age-long curse. Probably the special reference here is to the latter--the erection of the Ten Tribes into a separate monarchy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-16.</span> - The concluding verse is at once a conclusion and commencement - an inference from what preceded, and the beginning of a second line of proof showing that, while their ruin was by themselves, their restoration would be by God. When the kings and princes whom they had sinfully sought, and who had been given to them in anger would fail, God himself would be their King, as is stated in vers. 10 and 11. Further, when in consequence of their iniquities treasured up, their sorrows and sufferings would be extreme, as stated in vers. 12 and 13, yet they would be raised up as out of their graves, as promised in ver. 14. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - Israel had shown contempt for Jehovah by putting confidence in kings of their own choice, yet these kings could not afford them help, whence the questions of ver. 10. The usual rendering is at fault. <span class="cmt_word">I will be thy King.</span> This should rather be, <span class="accented">Where now is thy king?</span> though <span class="accented">ehi</span> may be either verb or adverb. <span class="cmt_word">Where is any other that may says thee in all thy cities?</span> Better take both clauses together and in connection, thus: <span class="accented">Where, now, is thy kin</span>g<span class="accented">, that he may save thee in all thy cities?</span> <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word <span class="accented">ehi</span> we take, with Ewald, to be a dialectic variation for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>, or shortened form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, and this is strengthened by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> or Latin <span class="accented">tandem</span>, for sake of emphasis. The purpose for which the Israelites had asked a king was that he might "judge them and go out before them to fight their battles" (<a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>). The question, then, does not indicate the want of a king, or the prevalence of a state of anarchy, but that a crisis had come when such a king as they had requested should exhibit his prowess and display his power. It is as though the prophet asked, or rather God by his servant," Where is now the king that can defend the besieged cities, or deliver the attacked fortresses; and defeat the Assyrian foeman who is now threatening both? Or where are the judges (<span class="accented">shophetim</span>), or the princes (<span class="accented">sarim</span>), who constitute his cabinet or royal counselors sharing in the counsels of state, and administering the affairs of the kingdom under him?" The answer implied is that those visible helps, on which Israel had so confidently calculated, turned out valueless; the kingly constitution on which they had set their heart proved a failure, as far as help and deliverance were concerned. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Kimchi and others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span> as first person future of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span>; thus: "I shall be established for ever, but where is thy king?
