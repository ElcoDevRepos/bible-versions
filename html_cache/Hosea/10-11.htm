Threshing was a relatively easy and rewarding task for cattle, as it allowed them to eat while they worked. This imagery suggests that Ephraim had been in a position of comfort and privilege, enjoying the benefits of their labor without much hardship. Historically, Ephraim was one of the most prominent tribes in Israel, often leading in prosperity and influence. The metaphor indicates a period of ease and abundance, but also hints at complacency and self-indulgence.<p><b>but I will place a yoke on her fair neck.</b><br>The yoke symbolizes subjugation and hard labor. God declares that He will impose discipline on Ephraim, transitioning them from a state of ease to one of servitude and difficulty. This reflects the impending judgment and captivity that would come upon Israel due to their disobedience and idolatry. The "fair neck" suggests beauty and strength, indicating that Ephraim's current state is one of grace and potential, yet it will be subjected to control and restraint. This is a prophetic warning of the Assyrian conquest, where Israel would lose its autonomy and freedom.<p><b>I will harness Ephraim,</b><br>The act of harnessing implies control and direction. God intends to redirect Ephraim's path, moving them from their self-directed ways to a path of divine correction. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty and His ability to guide nations according to His purposes. The harnessing also suggests a transformation from a life of ease to one of labor and submission, aligning with the consequences of their covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>Judah will plow,</b><br>Judah, representing the southern kingdom, is depicted as plowing, a task that involves preparation and hard work. This indicates that Judah, unlike Ephraim, will be engaged in a more laborious and foundational role. Historically, Judah remained more faithful to God compared to the northern kingdom, though they too would eventually face judgment. The plowing metaphor suggests a role in preparing the ground, possibly for future restoration and blessing, aligning with prophecies of a remnant and the coming of the Messiah from the line of Judah.<p><b>and Jacob will break the hard ground.</b><br>Jacob, representing the entire nation of Israel, is tasked with breaking the hard ground, a metaphor for repentance and renewal. This imagery suggests a call to spiritual renewal and the breaking up of hardened hearts. The hard ground symbolizes the stubbornness and sinfulness of the people, which must be addressed for true restoration to occur. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of repentance and the need for a contrite heart, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/4-3.htm">Jeremiah 4:3</a> and <a href="/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>, which call for breaking up fallow ground and seeking the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used as a symbol for the entire nation due to its prominence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom, representing the remaining tribes of Israel after the division.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Refers to the patriarch Jacob, but here symbolizes the entire nation of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing.htm">Threshing</a></b><br>An agricultural process of separating grain from chaff, symbolizing ease and abundance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/y/yoke.htm">Yoke</a></b><br>A wooden beam used between a pair of oxen to enable them to pull together on a load, symbolizing subjugation and labor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_heifer.htm">Symbolism of the Heifer</a></b><br>Ephraim is likened to a well-trained heifer, indicating initial obedience and prosperity.

God likens the northern kingdom to a pampered heifer relishing easy threshing, yet He vows to replace freedom with a yoke, harnessing Ephraim, pressing Judah, and engaging the whole house of Jacob in hard, corrective labor. The verse underscores that privilege without obedience invites discipline, and the Lord&#8217;s ultimate aim is to break up hardened hearts so that true repentance and righteousness may take root.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Heifer</span>.--Translate, <span class= "ital">Ephraim is a trained heifer, which loves to thresh.</span> Here the idea may be that Ephraim loves the easy and free work of treading out the corn, and so becomes fat and sleek; or the act of treading and threshing may point to the rough treatment which Ephraim has in her pride dealt out to her neighbours and enemies. But the former interpretation is more probable. The verse should continue to read thus:--<span class= "ital">And I passed by the fairness of her neck</span> (to arrest her self-indulgence). <span class= "ital">I will harness Ephraim for riding</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> I will cause a rider, Assyria, to take possession of her, and she shall be bound in unwelcome toil to do the bidding of another.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn.</span> Ephraim is compared to a heifer trained. The work she was taught to do was treading cut the corn; by training and habit it had became a second nature, so that she took delight in it. The connecting vowel occurs seldom, and usually with an antique coloring in prose, according to Ewald; it is poetical besides, and used in the concourse of words somewhat closely connected, but not in the strict construct state. Thus is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> accounted for. This work was probably easier, at all events pleasanter, than plowing or harrowing. In treading out corn oxen were not yoked together, but worked singly, treading it with their feet, or drawing a threshing-sledge, or iron-armed cylinder, over it; they were unmuzzled also, so that they were free to snatch an occasional mouthful of the grain, and frequently fattened by such indulgence. Such had been the position of Ephraim in easy employment, comfortable circumstances like the heifer threshing and allowed to eat at pleasure, pleasantly situated prosperous, self-indulgent, and luxurious. The victories of Ephraim - threshing and treading down may perhaps be also hinted at. <span class="cmt_word">But I passed over upon her fair neck</span> (margin, <span class="accented">the beauty of her neck</span>): <span class="cmt_word">I will make Ephraim to ride; Judak shall plough, and Jacob shall break his clods.</span> Times have changed, as is here indicated a yoke, that of Assyria, is placed on the fair neck, a rider is set on the sleek back. Mere onerous and less pleasant labor is now imposed. Judah too is to share the toil, being put to the heavier work of plowing while Jacob - the ten tribes, or the twelve including both Judah and Israel - shall cross plough; and thus both alike shall be henceforth employed in the heaviest labors of the field and the severest toils of agriculture. Once victorious, Ephraim is now to be subdued; once free and intractable, it must now receive the yoke and engage in laborious service. The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>, followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, is generally used in a bad sense; "to <span class="accented">pass over</span>," says Jerome, "especially when it is said of God, always signifies inflictions and troubles." The fatness of the neck is the ox's ornament or beauty. That is now to be assaulted or invaded gently it may be, and softly, as men are wont to approach a young untamed animal in order to put the yoke upon it. This passing over, however tender, fixes the yoke on Ephraim's neck all the same. A more difficult word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, which Ewald <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> renders, "I will set a rider" on Ephraim, of course to subdue and tame; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Jerome has, "I will mount or ride," thus representing Jehovah himself as the mediate rider on Ephraim. The first sense has a parallel in <a href="/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a>, "Thou hast made men to ride over our head," and thus ruling them at pleasure. Unwilling to bear the easy yoke of their Divine Ruler, they shall be subjected to the tyrant mastery of man. But <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil says the word here is "not" to mount or ride, 'but' to drive or use for drawing and driving,' <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> harness," as to the plough and harrow. This meaning is best reached by understanding the words thus: "I will make the yoke to ride on Ephraim's neck;" as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5db;&#x5d1;</span> is used in <a href="/2_kings/13-16.htm">2 Kings 13:16</a>, for "put thine hand upon the bow," margin, "make thine hand to ride upon the bow." The remaining clauses of the verse is a further development of this expression, but extending to Judah; and thus including both Judah and Ephraim, or Jacob - both kingdoms. The Septuagint version of the last clause is peculiar; it is <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3b2;</span>. That is, as explained by Jerome, "I shall leave Judah for the present and say nothing about him; but whoever, whether of Ephraim or Judah, shall observe my precepts, he shall acquire strength for himself and be called Jacob." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/10-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ephraim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1436;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
