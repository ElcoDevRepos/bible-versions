The imagery of "hedging up" suggests a protective barrier, but here it is used as a form of discipline. Thorns are often symbolic of pain and difficulty, reflecting the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness. In biblical context, thorns are associated with the curse of sin (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>) and represent obstacles that prevent progress. This action is a divine intervention to prevent Israel from continuing in idolatry and sin, similar to how God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><b>I will enclose her with a wall,</b><br>The wall signifies a more permanent and insurmountable barrier compared to the thorns. In ancient times, walls were used for protection and separation. Here, it symbolizes God's determination to isolate Israel from her sinful paths. This enclosure is not for destruction but for correction, aiming to bring Israel back to a covenant relationship with God. The imagery of a wall can also be seen in the New Testament, where Christ is described as the cornerstone, breaking down the dividing wall of hostility (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><b>so she cannot find her way.</b><br>This phrase highlights the result of God's intervention: Israel's inability to pursue her own misguided desires. The inability to "find her way" suggests a loss of direction and purpose, a common consequence of turning away from God. This reflects the spiritual blindness that comes from sin (<a href="/isaiah/59-10.htm">Isaiah 59:10</a>). The purpose of this divine obstruction is to lead Israel to repentance and restoration, echoing the parable of the lost sheep where the shepherd seeks to bring the lost back to safety (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gomer.htm">Gomer</a></b><br>Hosea's wife, whose unfaithfulness symbolizes Israel's spiritual adultery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, pursuing idolatry and alliances with foreign nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who uses Hosea's life as a prophetic symbol of His relationship with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/thorns_and_wall.htm">Thorns and Wall</a></b><br>Metaphorical barriers representing God's intervention to prevent Israel from pursuing idolatry and sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention_as_mercy.htm">Divine Intervention as Mercy</a></b><br>God's hedging is an act of mercy, not just judgment.

The sudden change of person from the third to the second is very observable. This directness of address is, in this instance, expressive of deep indignation. She had avowed her determination to pursue her evil courses shamefully and sinfully, as if in despite and defiance of the Almighty. In deep and undisguised displeasure, and with a suddenness springing from indignation, he affirms his determination to thwart her course of sin and shame; as though addressing her personally and promptly, he said, "Then thou shalt not be able to carry out thy plan or accomplish thy purpose; I will see to that." The hedge and wall are elsewhere, as in <a href="/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>, used for protection and defense, here for prevention and obstruction, and similarly in <a href="/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>, "He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths;" and in <a href="/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7</a>, "He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out," and ver. 9, "<span class="accented">He</span> hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked." Thus Kimchi: "<span class="accented">I</span> will hedge thy way with thorns, so that they cannot go out of the city because of the devastation; and her lovers shall not be able to help her, and they are Assyria and Egypt." After quoting his father's explanation of lovers, he pro-coeds: "So their way is as if there were in it a thorn hedge, and thorns that she could not pass through it, and could not find her paths in which she walked." The fence here is double one a hedge of thorns, sharp, prickly, and piercing, such as forbid her forcing a way through: the other a wall of stone that cannot be climbed, or leaped, or otherwise got over. We need not try to specify the particular circumstances that thus hedged in and walled about the adulteress - whether fightings within or foes beleaguering without, whether straitened means or stress of circumstances raising an impassable barrier against the practice of idolatry, or an enforced conviction of its futility. "<span class="accented">If</span>," says Kimchi, "<span class="accented">she</span> seek to <span class="accented">Assyria</span> and Egypt, they will not give her their friendship and their help." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
