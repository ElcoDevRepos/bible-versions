This mixing signifies a departure from their covenant with God, leading to spiritual adultery. Historically, Israel was called to be a distinct people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>), set apart to worship Yahweh alone. By mingling with other nations, they adopted foreign customs and idolatry, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This phrase echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a> against intermarriage with pagan nations, which would lead to turning away from God. The mixing symbolizes compromise and loss of identity, reflecting the broader theme of Israel's unfaithfulness throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>Ephraim is an unturned cake.</b><br>The metaphor of an "unturned cake" or "half-baked cake" illustrates incompleteness and lack of thoroughness in Ephraim's devotion to God. In ancient times, bread was baked on hot stones, requiring turning to cook evenly. An unturned cake is burnt on one side and raw on the other, symbolizing Ephraim's superficial religiosity and inconsistency. This imagery highlights their failure to fully commit to God, being partially devoted but ultimately ineffective and insincere. The unturned cake also suggests judgment, as it is unfit for consumption, paralleling the spiritual state of Israel. This metaphor can be connected to the New Testament call for wholehearted devotion (<a href="/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>), where lukewarm faith is rejected. The image serves as a warning against half-heartedness in one's relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used synonymously with Israel in the prophetic books.

Ephraim was consumed by the unhallowed fire of Baal-worship, with all its passion and sensualism--a cake burnt on one side to a cinder, and on the other left in a condition utterly unfit for food. So the activity of foreign idolatries and foreign alliances, and the consequent unfaithfulness to Israel's God, are the nation's ruin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</span> The people of the northern kingdom had fallen away from Jehovah, and mixed themselves with the heathen nationalities. They resembled a cake which, through neglect of turning, was burnt on the one side and raw on the other. The best commentary on the first clause of this verse is found in <a href="/psalms/106-35.htm">Psalm 106:35, 36</a>, and 39; they "were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.... Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a-whoring with their own inventions." The second clause is well explained by Bishop Horsley as follows: "One thing on one side, another on the other; burnt to a coal at bottom, raw dough at the top. An apt image of a character that is all inconsistencies. Such were the ten tribes of the prophet's day; worshippers of Jehovah in profession, but adopting all the idolatries of the neighboring nations, in addition to their own semi-idolatry of the calves." Similarly, the Geneva Bible has, "Baked on one side and raw on the ether, he is neither through hot nor through cold, but partly a Jew and partly a Gentile." Jehovah had chosen Israel out of the nations of the earth, and given them a special constitution. The object of this segregation was that Israel should be a peculiar people and a holy nation. Thus distinguished, they were to dwell alone; but, ungrateful for this high distinction, and unmindful of their high destiny, they mingled with the nations, learned their heathenish ways, and worshipped their hateful idols. Thus they forfeited their theocratic pre-eminence. While it was their privilege as well u duty to follow the precepts of Jehovah, and serve him with undivided affection, they fell away from his service and adopted the idolatries and habits of the heathen; it was only a just retribution, therefore, when God gave them ever into the hand of those heathen peoples to waste their resources and leave them shorn of their strength. The second clause is the counterpart of this; exactly like the peoples subsequently brought from Assyria, and planted in the lands of the <span class="accented">dispossessed</span> Israelites, they worshipped the Lord, but served their own gods - they were neither true worshippers of Jehovah nor out-and-out followers of Baal. In religion they were <span class="accented">mongrels - inconsistent</span> and worthless hybrids; they were, in fact, what Calvin in rather homely phrase says of them," neither flesh nor <span class="accented">fish</span>." The comment of Kimchi is concise as it is clear: "The prophet means to say, He (Israel) mixes himself among the peoples; though God - blessed be he I - separated them from them, yet they mix them. selves among them and do according to their works." His explanation of the second clause is not so satisfactory when he says, "<span class="accented">As</span> a cake which is baked upon the coals; if they do not turn it, it is burnt below and not baked above, so is the counsel that is not right when they do not turn it from side to side (sense to sense) until they bring it upon their wheels (into action). So (thoughtless and hasty) is Ephraim in his determination to serve the calves and other gods without proving and choosing what is good." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Other explanations need only be referred to in order to be rejected, as <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of Rashi, who is followed by Grotius. He takes the verb in the future sense: "<span class="accented">Ephraim</span> in exile shall be mixed among the peoples." But it is obviously the present, not the future time, that is intended - the present sin, not its future punishment. There is <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the explanation of Aben Ezra, followed by Eichhorn and Maurer, referring to the alliances or treaties which the northern kingdom formed with their neighbors to repel their enemies, and by which the resources of the land were consumed; while the second clause,  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/7-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ephraim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1429;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_669.htm">Strong's 669: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ephraim -- a son of Joseph, also his descendants and their territory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">mixes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7791;&#183;b&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1101.htm">Strong's 1101: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mingle, mix, confuse, confound</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with the nations;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
