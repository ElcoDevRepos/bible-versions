In the context of Hosea, the Northern Kingdom of Israel is being addressed. The people had turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and immorality. The "knowledge" referred to is not merely intellectual but relational and covenantal, emphasizing a deep understanding and relationship with God. This lack of knowledge leads to spiritual and moral decay, resulting in destruction. The Bible often equates knowledge of God with wisdom and life (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7, 9</a>:10).<p><b>Because you have rejected knowledge,</b><br>The rejection of knowledge is a willful act, indicating that the people and their leaders, particularly the priests, have turned away from God's teachings. This rejection is not due to ignorance but a deliberate choice to ignore God's commandments and pursue their own desires. This mirrors the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, where choosing life and prosperity is linked to loving and obeying God.<p><b>I will also reject you as My priests.</b><br>The priests in Israel were responsible for teaching the law and guiding the people in worship and obedience to God. By rejecting knowledge, they failed in their duties, leading to God's rejection of them. This is a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to loss of privilege and position. The priesthood was meant to be a type of Christ, the ultimate High Priest, who perfectly mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>Since you have forgotten the law of your God,</b><br>Forgetting the law implies neglect and disregard for God's commandments, which were meant to guide the Israelites in righteousness and justice. The law was central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>. This forgetfulness is not accidental but a result of persistent disobedience and idolatry, as seen throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>I will also forget your children.</b><br>This phrase indicates the generational consequences of rejecting God. The sins of the parents affect their descendants, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where God warns of the iniquity of the fathers being visited upon the children. This is not a denial of individual responsibility but a recognition of the communal and generational impact of sin. The hope, however, lies in repentance and turning back to God, who is merciful and willing to restore (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, leading to their eventual downfall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for teaching and upholding the law, criticized here for failing in their duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who holds His people accountable for their knowledge and adherence to His law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_israel.htm">Children of Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of the Israelites, who suffer consequences due to the previous generation's failures.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_knowledge.htm">The Importance of Knowledge</a></b><br>Understanding God's Word is crucial for spiritual health and avoiding destruction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_rejection.htm">Consequences of Rejection</a></b><br>Rejecting God's knowledge leads to personal and communal consequences, including spiritual leadership failure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_spiritual_leaders.htm">Role of Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>Priests and leaders are accountable for teaching and upholding God's law; failure impacts future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_impact.htm">Generational Impact</a></b><br>Our spiritual negligence can have lasting effects on our children and community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_remember.htm">Call to Remember</a></b><br>Actively remembering and applying God's law is essential for maintaining a relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hosea_4_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hosea 4:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_4_6_Why_is_knowledge_vital.htm">How does Hosea 4:6 highlight the importance of knowledge in our faith journey?

The knowledge of God is life eternal. (Comp. <a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>.) The Lord's "controversy" repudiates the entire priesthood, as they had rejected the true knowledge of God. They had inclined to calf-worship, had been vacillating respecting Baal, and had connived at moral offences. If, on the other hand, with most commentators, we consider the people themselves as thus addressed, the passage refers to the cessation of the position of priesthood, which every member of the true theocracy ought to have maintained. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>.) The people should no longer be priests to Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.</span> Here the verb is plural and its subject singular, because, being collective, it comprehends all the individual members of the nation. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d5;</span> is rendered <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by Jerome in the sense of "silence:" "conticuit populus incus," which he explains to mean "sinking into eternal silence." So also the Chaldee. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX., understands it in the sense of "likeness:" "My people are like (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) as if they had no knowledge." Aben Ezra disproves this sense as follows: "This word, if it were from the root signifying 'likeness,' would have after it <span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">seghol</span>, as, 'To [<span class="accented">el</span> with <span class="accented">seghol</span>] whom art thou like in thy greatness?' (<a href="/ezekiel/31-2.htm">Ezekiel 31:2</a>); but without the word <span class="accented">el</span> it has the meaning of ' cutting off.'" So Kimchi: "Here also it has the sense of 'cutting off.'" The article before "knowledge" implies renewed mention and refers to the word in ver. 1; or it may emphasize the word as that knowledge by way of eminence, which surpasses all other knowledge, and without which no other knowledge can really prove a blessing in the end. The knowledge of God is the most excellent of all sciences. Paul counted all things but loss in comparison with its possession; and our blessed Lord himself says, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent;" while the Prophet Isaiah attributed the captivity to its absence: "My people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge." <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast rejected knowledge... seeing thou hast forgotten the Law of thy Son.</span> The cause of this ignorance is here charged on the unfaithfulness of the priesthood. They rejected knowledge and forgot the Law of their God. The two concluding clauses of this verse may be regarded as "split members" of a single sentence. As rejection implies the presence of the object rejected, while forgetfulness implies its absence from the mind or memory, some have understood rejection of knowledge as the sin of the priest, and forgetfulness that of the people. This separation is not necessary, for what men continue for a time to despise they will by-and-by forget. The forgetfulness is thus an advance upon rejection. The sin of these priests was very great, for, while the priests' lips were required to keep knowledge, they neither preserved that knowledge themselves nor promoted it among the people; hence the indignant and direct address. Thus Kimchi says: "He addresses the priestly order that existed at that time: Thou hast rejected he knowledge for thyself and to teach it to the people, consequently I will reject thee from being a priest unto me. Since thou dost not exercise the office of priest, which is to teach the Law, I will reject thee so that thou shalt not be a priest in my house." <span class="cmt_word">I will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me... I will also forget thy children, even I.</span> The punishment resembles the offence; the human delinquency is reflected in the Divine retaliation. To make this the more pointed, the "thou on thy part (<span class="accented">attah</span>)" at the head of the sentence has its counterpart, or rather is counterbalanced by the "even I" or "I too (<span class="accented">gam ani</span>)" at its close. The severity of the punishment is augmented by the threat that, not only the then existing priests, but their sons after them, would be excluded from the honor of the priesthood. This was touching painfully the tenderest part. It needs scarcely be observed that forgetfulness is only spoken of God in a figurative sense, and after the manner of men, that being forgotten which is no longer the object of attention or affection. "The meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>," says Kimchi, "is by way of figure, like the man who forgets something and does not take it to heart." The unusual form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span> has been variously accounted for. The Massorites mark the <span class="accented">aleph</span> before <span class="accented">caph</span> as redundant; it is omitted in several manuscripts of Kennicott and De Rossi, as also some of the early printed editions. Kimchi confesses his ignorance of its use. Olshausen treats it as a copyist's error; but Ewald "regards it as an Aram-seen pausal form." Some take the reference to be to Israel as a kingdom of priests (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>) rather than to the actual priesthood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">My people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
