In the context of Hosea, it reflects God's deep lament over Israel's spiritual adultery. The Israelites have "strayed" from God, indicating a deliberate departure from His covenant and commandments. This straying is akin to the actions of a wayward spouse, which is a recurring theme in Hosea, symbolizing Israel's unfaithfulness. The historical context shows that Israel was engaging in idolatry and forming alliances with foreign nations, contrary to God's instructions. This phrase echoes the warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience.<p><b>Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against Me!</b><br>The word "destruction" signifies the severe consequences of Israel's rebellion. Rebellion here is not just a passive drifting away but an active defiance against God's authority and commands. This rebellion is seen in their worship of Baal and other Canaanite deities, which was prevalent during the time of Hosea. The historical context includes the political instability and moral decay in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, leading to its eventual downfall. This phrase is reminiscent of the warnings given by other prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, who also spoke of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>Though I would redeem them, they speak lies against Me.</b><br>God's desire to "redeem" reflects His enduring love and willingness to restore Israel despite their unfaithfulness. Redemption in the biblical sense involves deliverance from sin and its consequences, pointing to the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ. However, Israel's response is to "speak lies," indicating deceit and falsehood in their relationship with God. This could refer to their insincere worship and false promises of repentance. The cultural context includes the influence of false prophets who led the people astray. This phrase highlights the tension between God's mercy and justice, a theme that runs throughout the prophetic books. The concept of redemption is further developed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is the ultimate act of redemption for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which had turned away from God and engaged in idolatry and political alliances contrary to God's will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who expresses His sorrow and anger over Israel's rebellion, yet also His desire to redeem them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion.htm">Rebellion</a></b><br>The act of Israel turning away from God, engaging in idolatry, and forming alliances with foreign nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/redemption.htm">Redemption</a></b><br>God's longing to restore and save His people despite their unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rebellion.htm">The Consequences of Rebellion</a></b><br>Rebellion against God leads to destruction.

Of these exclamations, the first is general and indefinite, the second is specific and precise. The thought of coming chastisement calls forth the exclamation of woe; while the second exclamation fixes the character and explains the nature of that woe denounced. In neither case does <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> need to be supplied; the opposite expression is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> In assigning the reason, there is a retrospective reference to the figures of the two immediately preceding verses. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> with rain is employed in relation to birds which, when scared from their nest, fly away. Kimchi thinks it applies to the abstention or withdrawal of the Israelites from Divine service in the national sanctuary in Jerusalem. His comment is: "They fly from me, from the service of the house of my sanctuary, to the service of the calves; and this is a breach of faith and defection from me." The LXX. translate the beginning of the second clause freely by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "they are cowards;" and Jerome by "miseri (maticulose) erunt, et semper timentis ac formidantes." The cause assigned is their breaking covenant with God, which is expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, literally, "to break away from," "tear one's self loose from." <span class="cmt_word">Though I have redeemed them</span>. This first part of the last clause is rendered <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a past by some, as Jerome, who refers it to the redemption from Egypt; thus also the Chaldee: "And I was their Deliverer." Rosenm&uuml;ller approves of this, but, instead of restricting it to the deliverance from Egypt, includes their recent deliverance from the Syrians by Jeroboam II. It is <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> better rendered in a voluntative or optative sense: "I would (should like) to redeem them, but they speak lies against (or, concerning) me." The verb '<span class="accented">ephdem</span> cannot with any propriety be taken for a preterit. Yet they have spoken lies against me; rather, <span class="accented">but they on their part have spoken lies con</span>cerning me. The prophet had already charged them with lying at ver. 3, and previously at <a href="/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>; but their lies were not confined to their intercourse or dealings with their fellow-men; they spoke lies <span class="accented">against</span> or, as the preposition sometimes signifies, <span class="accented">concerning</span> God.
