In biblical context, the heart is often seen as the center of thought and moral decision-making (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). The Israelites' failure to consider their actions reflects a deeper issue of spiritual apathy and rebellion against God. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-14.htm">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>, where forgetting God leads to downfall.<p><b>that I remember all their evil.</b><br>God's omniscience is emphasized here, as He is fully aware of the sins of the people. This is consistent with other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, which affirm that nothing is hidden from God. The historical context shows that Israel was engaged in idolatry and alliances with pagan nations, which were considered evil in the sight of God. This remembrance is not just intellectual but carries the weight of impending judgment, as seen in the prophetic warnings throughout Hosea.<p><b>Now their deeds are all around them;</b><br>The imagery of deeds surrounding the people suggests that their sins are pervasive and inescapable. This can be connected to the cultural practices of the time, where public and private life were intertwined, and one's actions were visible to the community. The phrase also implies that the consequences of their actions are evident, much like the warnings in <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, "your sin will find you out."<p><b>they are before My face.</b><br>This phrase underscores the immediacy and seriousness of God's awareness of sin. In biblical terms, being "before God's face" indicates direct accountability to Him, as seen in <a href="/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a>, where God observes all human ways. Theologically, this points to the holiness of God and His intolerance of sin, foreshadowing the need for atonement and ultimately pointing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who reconciles humanity to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to in Hosea as Ephraim, which had turned away from God and engaged in idolatry and immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is addressing the sins of Israel through the prophet Hosea, reminding them of His omniscience and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God is fully aware of all our actions, thoughts, and intentions.

The latter, equivalent to saying "in their heart," which is the usual expression, denotes one's inward thoughts or reasonings with himself; the former, equivalent to saying "to their heart," is an address to, or remonstrance with, the heart with the view of restraining its evil purposes. God's remembrance of wickedness imports its punishment. Now their own doings have beset them about. Their doings <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> have become evident or conspicuous as a robe or garment with which a man is surrounded, or a troop of body-guards placed about him. Or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the terrors and penal consequences of their sins have surrounded them like a garment, as we elsewhere read, "He clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment." In this latter sense the figure is rather taken from enemies besieging a town or city, and beleaguering it closely all around, or from lictors, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> officers of the law surrounding them, or even witnesses confronting them on every side. Kimchi explains the sense as follows: "Now their evil deeds surround them, which were before my face and were not hidden from me; and, while they receive the punishment, they will remember that 1 know all the whole, and that it is I who return their reward upon their head." <span class="cmt_word">They are before my face</span>, in the last clause, has a striking and awe-inspiring parallel in the ninetieth psalm: "Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance." Aben Ezra's exposition is somewhat obscure; it is as follows: "They think that I do not see them, and they do not observe that their actions encircle them, as they are before my face." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But they fail to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
