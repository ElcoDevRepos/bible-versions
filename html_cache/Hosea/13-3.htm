In the ancient Near East, morning mist quickly dissipates with the rising sun, symbolizing how Israel's strength and stability will vanish. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of the transience of life and human endeavors without God, as seen in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist that appears briefly and then vanishes.<p><b>like the early dew that vanishes</b><br>Dew in the ancient world was crucial for agriculture, especially in arid regions. However, it evaporates quickly, illustrating the idea of impermanence. This metaphor highlights the futility of Israel's reliance on idols and foreign alliances instead of God. The imagery of dew is also used in <a href="/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>, where God laments Israel's fleeting loyalty, further emphasizing the theme of inconsistency in their devotion.<p><b>like chaff blown from a threshing floor</b><br>Chaff represents what is worthless and easily discarded, separated from the valuable grain during threshing. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to depict judgment and the separation of the righteous from the wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a> and <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>. The threshing floor was a common agricultural setting in ancient Israel, making this metaphor relatable and vivid for the original audience.<p><b>like smoke through an open window</b><br>Smoke is insubstantial and quickly disperses, symbolizing the inevitable and swift judgment upon Israel. The open window suggests exposure and vulnerability, indicating that Israel's defenses and idols cannot protect them from God's righteous judgment. This imagery aligns with the prophetic warnings throughout the Old Testament, where God uses natural elements to convey the certainty and thoroughness of His judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/9-18.htm">Isaiah 9:18-19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to in Hosea as Ephraim, which had turned away from God and was facing impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor.htm">Threshing Floor</a></b><br>A place where grain is separated from chaff, symbolizing judgment and separation in biblical imagery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/morning_mist_and_dew.htm">Morning Mist and Dew</a></b><br>Natural phenomena that quickly disappear, symbolizing the fleeting nature of Israel's faithfulness and existence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/smoke.htm">Smoke</a></b><br>Represents something that is insubstantial and transient, illustrating the temporary nature of Israel's prosperity and security.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_earthly_security.htm">The Transience of Earthly Security</a></b><br>Just as mist, dew, chaff, and smoke are temporary, so is any security or prosperity that is not rooted in God.

The verse invites every reader to cling to the LORD alone, whose faithfulness, unlike these images, endures forever (<a href="/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Early dew</span> . . .--Better, dew <span class= "ital">that early passeth away, like chaff that flies in a whirlwind from the threshing-floor, and like smoke from the window</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the lattice beneath the roof through which it vanished).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind cut of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</span> The illative particle with which the verse begins has reference to the sins of Israel, so great and multiplied that punishment could not be long delayed. Their irrational and God-dishonoring conduct was bringing on them sure and swift destruction. The prophet employs four figures to exhibit their political extinction. Two of these, the morning cloud and early dew, or rather the dew early passing away, have already been employed by him to characterize the transient nature of Israel's goodness; here they denote the evanescent nature of their national existence. The other two are the chaff and the smoke; the former whirled away by the storm-wind from the threshing-floor, the latter dissipated and speedily vanishing as soon as it escapes from the chimney or lattice. Such shall be the utter extermination of Israel. The senselessness of their idolatry had been treated with derision in the preceding verse; the punishment of their sin is sternly denounced in this. Kimchi comments concisely and correctly thus: "Therefore they shall go to destruction, and shall be as the morning cloud, or as the dew speedily disappearing in the morning, width vanishes when the heat of the sun has touched it; so they shall go away speedily. So also shall they be as chaff - it is the fine particles of straw, which the wind whirls away from the threshing-floor; thus shall they be whirled away from their land. Or as a pillar of smoke which goes forth out of the lattice, which shall speedily disperse and cease."
