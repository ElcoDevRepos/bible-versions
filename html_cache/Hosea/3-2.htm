In the context of Hosea, this act symbolizes God's redemption of Israel despite their unfaithfulness. The act of buying back Gomer, Hosea's wife, is a vivid illustration of God's love and commitment to His covenant people, even when they stray. This mirrors the redemptive work of Christ, who "bought" humanity with His sacrifice (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>).<p><b>for fifteen shekels of silver</b><br>The price of fifteen shekels of silver is significant as it represents half the typical price of a slave, which was thirty shekels (<a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>). This may suggest Gomer's diminished value due to her unfaithfulness, yet Hosea's willingness to pay this price underscores the depth of his love and commitment. This can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He paid the ultimate price for humanity's redemption, regardless of their worthiness.<p><b>and a homer and a lethech of barley</b><br>The inclusion of barley, a less expensive grain, alongside the silver, indicates a mixed form of payment. Barley was often considered the food of the poor, highlighting the humble circumstances of the transaction. This reflects the humility of Christ, who came not with earthly wealth but with spiritual riches. The combination of silver and barley may also symbolize the completeness of the redemption, as both monetary and sustenance needs are met. This act of redemption is a precursor to the ultimate redemption through Jesus, who provides both spiritual and physical sustenance (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver His message to the Israelites.

The purchase of wives is still a very common practice in the East (See Henderson's <span class= "ital">Commentary,</span> and Deut. xxi 14.)<p><span class= "bld">Half homer of barley.--</span>Half a homer is the translation given to the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">lethekh,</span> which occurs only in this passage. This rendering is founded on the interpretation half a cor (cor = homer), which is given in all the Greek versions except the LXX. The latter read "and a <span class= "ital">nebhel</span> of wine," the <span class= "ital">nebhel</span> being probably a skin bottle of a certain liquid capacity. This pre-supposes a different Hebrew text. From <a href="/2_kings/7-1.htm" title="Then Elisha said, Hear you the word of the LORD; Thus said the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.">2Kings 7:1</a> we may infer that an ephah of barley at ordinary times would cost one shekel (comp. <a href="/amos/8-5.htm" title="Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?">Amos 8:5</a>), and since a homer contains ten ephahs, the price paid by the prophet was thirty shekels altogether. Reckoning a shekel as <span class= "ital">=</span> two drachms (so LXX.), or 2s. 6 d., the price paid by Hosea was about 3 15s. According to <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm" title="If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.">Exodus 21:32</a>, this was the compensation enacted for a slave gored to death by a bull, and is a hint of the degradation to which Gomer had sunk.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So I bought</span> (<span class="accented">acquired</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley and an half-homer</span> (margin, <span class="accented">lethech</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of barley</span>. In narrating the prophet's compliance with the Divine command, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;</span>is connected by Aben Ezra with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> in the sense of making acquaintance with; but it is more correctly referred by Kimchi to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> with daghesh euphonic in the <span class="accented">caph</span> as in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> shall meet thee. "The daghesh of the <span class="accented">caph</span> is for euphony as in <span class="accented">miqdush</span>, and the root is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> (Kimchi). The meaning is then simply and naturally traced as follows: to dig, obtain by digging, acquire. The price paid for the acquisition in this case was either the purchase money paid to the parents of the bride, as to Laban in the case of Rachel and Leah by Jacob, or the marriage present paid (<span class="accented">mohar</span>) to the bride herself. Another view represents the prophet paying the price to the woman's husband to whom she had been unfaithful, and who in consequence resigned her for so small a sum. It remains for us to attend to the amount thus paid. Fifteen pieces of silver or shekels would be about one pound fifteen shillings, or one pound seventeen and six-pence; while the price of the barley would he somewhere about the same. There were fifty or sixty shekels in a <span class="accented">mana</span>, Greek <span class="accented">mina</span>, and Latin <span class="accented">ulna</span>; while the maneh was cue-sixtieth of a talent (<span class="accented">kikteer</span>); and thus three thousand or three thousand six hundred shekels in a talent. The homer, the largest of the Hebrew dry measures, contained one cor or ten ephahs ( = ten baths of liquids = ten Attic <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and the half-homer or <span class="accented">lethec</span> (<span class="accented">haemi-coros</span> in LXX.) was half a cop or five ephahs. These fifteen ephahs, at a shekel each - for under extraordinary circumstances (<a href="/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>) we read of" two measures of barley for a shekel" - would be equivalent to one pound fifteen or seventeen shillings and sixpence. Both together - the silver and the barley - would amount to thirty shekels, or three pounds and ten or fifteen shillings. Why this exact amount? and why such particularity in the reckoning? By turning to <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a> we learn that thirty shekels were the estimated value of a manservant or maidservant; for it is there stated that "if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver." The price paid by the prophet partly in money and partly in kind was exactly the price of an ordinary maidservant. The barley (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, plural, equivalent to "grains of barley") may hint the woman's unchastity, as it was the offering for a woman suspected of adultery (<a href="/numbers/5.htm">Numbers 5</a>.) The low estate of the person purchased is a legitimate inference kern all this. The wife, for whom such a paltry sum should be paid, and paid in such a way, or to whom such a petty gift would be offered, must be supposed to be in a condition of deep depression or in circumstances of great distress. Thus the sum paid by the prophet for his partner symbolizes the servile state of Israel when Jehovah chose them for his peculiar people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I bought her</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;ek&#183;k&#601;&#183;re&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">To trade, get by trade</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for fifteen [shekels]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2568.htm">Strong's 2568: </a> </span><span class="str2">Five</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of silver</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3701.htm">Strong's 3701: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silver, money</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and a homer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1445;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2563.htm">Strong's 2563: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bubbling up, of water, a wave, of earth, mire, clay, a heap, a chomer, dry measure</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and a lethek</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1445;&#1514;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#7791;e&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3963.htm">Strong's 3963: </a> </span><span class="str2">A measure for, things dry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of barley.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8184.htm">Strong's 8184: </a> </span><span class="str2">Barley</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/hosea/3-2.htm">OT Prophets: Hosea 3:2 So I bought her for myself (Ho Hs Hos.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/hosea/3-1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Hosea 3:1"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 3:1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/hosea/3-3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Hosea 3:3"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 3:3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
