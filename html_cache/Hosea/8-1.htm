Here, it serves as a warning of impending judgment. The urgency of the command suggests a critical moment for the nation. The use of the shofar is reminiscent of its role in the fall of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>), symbolizing divine intervention and judgment.<p><b>An eagle looms over the house of the LORD,</b><br>The eagle is often a symbol of swiftness and power. In this context, it represents an impending threat, likely the Assyrian army, known for its speed and might. The "house of the LORD" refers to Israel, God's chosen people, who are under threat due to their disobedience. The imagery of an eagle is also used in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a> to describe a nation that God would send against Israel as a consequence of their disobedience.<p><b>because the people have transgressed My covenant</b><br>The covenant refers to the agreement between God and Israel, established through figures like Abraham, Moses, and David. Transgressing the covenant implies a serious breach of faith and disobedience to God's commands. This is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where Israel's unfaithfulness leads to divine judgment. The covenant was meant to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>), and breaking it had severe consequences.<p><b>and rebelled against My law.</b><br>Rebellion against God's law indicates a deliberate and conscious decision to reject His commandments. The law, given through Moses, was central to Israel's identity and relationship with God. This rebellion is not just a legal infraction but a spiritual defiance against God's authority. The prophets frequently called Israel to repentance, urging them to return to the law (<a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a>). This rebellion is seen as a rejection of God's kingship, similar to the rebellion in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which had turned away from God and was facing impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple or the place where God's presence was acknowledged, symbolizing the spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eagle.htm">The Eagle</a></b><br>A symbol of impending judgment and destruction, often associated with swiftness and power, possibly representing an invading army.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_and_law.htm">Covenant and Law</a></b><br>The divine agreements and commandments given by God to Israel, which they had broken, leading to their downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_repentance.htm">The Urgency of Repentance</a></b><br>The trumpet symbolizes an urgent call to repentance.

The reason is clear: the nation has broken God&#8217;s covenant and defiantly rejected His law. The verse warns that divine judgment is imminent, yet the very blast of the ram&#8217;s horn also invites repentance before the eagle strikes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Eagle.--</span>The image of swiftness (<a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles.

The alarm of war or of hostile invasion is to be sounded by the prophet at the command of Jehovah. The <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> trumpet is at once to be employed for the purpose. The rendering of both the Targum and Syriac <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> expresses the same idea, though under a different form; the former has, "Cry with thy throat, as if it were a trumpet;" and the latter, "Let thy mouth be as a trumpet." According to this view, the Prophet Hoses expresses here very briefly what Isaiah has done more fully in the words, "Cry aloud [Hebrew, 'with the throat'] spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins." <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. here deviates considerably from the Maseoretic Hebrew text, translating <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span>, of the meaning of which Jerome acknowledges his ignorance, though he attempts to explain it. Cyril connects the words with the concluding part of the preceding chapter, thus: "This their setting at naught (of me) in the land of Egypt shall come into their own bosom. As the land, as the eagle against the house of the Lord;" while his explanation is as follows: "Since, though I preserved them and instructed them, and gave them victory over their enemies (for I strengthened them), they have impiously set me at naught, worshipping demons for gods, and have trusted to the land of the Egyptians, and have fancied that their help shall be sufficient for their prosperity, therefore their attempt shall return unto their own besom, and they shall find no good reward of their temerity; but they shall receive, as it were, into their bosom the deserved punishment. For he shall come, he shall come who shall lay them waste - the King of Assyria, with an innumerable multitude of warriors, and he shall come to them as the whole land and region and country, that one might think that the whole region of the Persians and Medes had wholly migrated and had come into Samaria. This is the meaning of the whole land (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span>). He shall likewise come as an eagle into the house of the Lord."
