The grain symbolizes sustenance and provision, which God had generously provided. In the context of Hosea, Israel's idolatry and reliance on Baal for agricultural prosperity are being addressed. The removal of grain signifies God's judgment and a reminder that He alone is the true provider. This echoes the covenant curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to a withdrawal of blessings.<p><b>and My new wine in its season;</b><br>New wine represents joy and celebration, often associated with God's blessings. The timing "in its season" underscores God's control over the natural order and the agricultural cycles. The removal of new wine is a direct consequence of Israel's spiritual adultery, highlighting the loss of joy and abundance due to their unfaithfulness. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God as the source of true joy and fulfillment, as seen in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>.<p><b>I will take away My wool and linen,</b><br>Wool and linen were essential materials for clothing and comfort, symbolizing God's provision for basic needs. In ancient Israel, these materials were also used in religious garments, indicating purity and holiness. The removal of wool and linen signifies a stripping away of both physical and spiritual coverings, pointing to the shame and exposure that result from sin. This act serves as a metaphor for God's judgment and the removal of His protective presence.<p><b>which were given to cover her nakedness.</b><br>Nakedness in the Bible often symbolizes shame and vulnerability, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a> with Adam and Eve. Here, it represents Israel's spiritual state without God's covering. The phrase highlights the consequences of Israel's infidelity, as they are left exposed and disgraced without God's protection. This imagery foreshadows the ultimate covering provided by Christ, who clothes believers in righteousness, as described in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a> and <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as an unfaithful wife in Hosea, symbolizing the nation's spiritual adultery through idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who provides for Israel but also disciplines them for their unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain,_new_wine,_wool,_and_linen.htm">Grain, New Wine, Wool, and Linen</a></b><br>Symbols of God's provision and blessings, which He threatens to withdraw due to Israel's unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nakedness.htm">Nakedness</a></b><br>Represents shame and exposure, highlighting the consequences of Israel's spiritual adultery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_ownership.htm">God's Provision and Ownership</a></b><br>Recognize that all blessings come from God and are ultimately His.

The king of Assyria (Tiglath-pileser, 734 B.C.) was the agency whereby this was to be accomplished. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm" title="O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation.">Isaiah 10:5</a>.) The raiment (wool and flax) was Jehovah's gift to cover her nakedness, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to meet the actual necessities of Israel. This He will tear away, and the idol-gods whom she has courted shall see her prostration, and their own helplessness to deliver or relieve.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.</span> The abuse of the Divine bounties mentioned in the preceding verse fully justifies the series of punishments that follow. God thus vindicates those penal inflictions. Accordingly he threatens them in this ninth verse with the deprivation of the bounties which they had misused as the means of idolatry and sin; in ver. 10 with disgrace; in ver. 11 with the departure of all her merry-makings; in ver. 12 with the destruction of the sources whence the means of idolatrous worship were supplied; and in ver. 13 with days of visitation proportionate to the time of declension and apostasy. The first clause of the verse under consideration is better rendered <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to the common Hebrew idiom, which employs two verbs to express one idea in a modified sense, the first denoting the manner, and so equivalent to an adverb with us, and the second signifying the matter; and it is thus translated by Keil: "<span class="accented">Therefore</span> will I take back my corn." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We admit the <span class="accented">ray</span> consecutive is opposed to this; and the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: and Jerome, "reverter et sumam." The manner of the dispossession intensifies the punishment, just as their abuse of those <span class="accented">possessions</span> had augmented their guilt. The food, refreshment, and raiment are to be taken away this certainly would be bad enough by itself, but the suddenness of the stroke adds poignancy to the infliction. The prospect of an indifferent harvest and of a bad vintage for weeks previously might have prepared them in some sort for the disaster. But when the time of harvest has already come and the season of vintage just arrived, by some sudden, unexpected calamity, whether tempest or hostile invasion, the bread-corn perishes and the wine-grapes are destroyed. The food is thus snatched, as it were, from their month, and the cup dashed from their lips; the sadness of the catastrophe is immensely increased by the sudden rudeness of the stroke by which it comes. Nor is this all. In the case of the raiment, or rather the material, the wool and the flax out of which it is formed, its removal reduces the intended wearer to perfect nudity, or, if we understand it as figure, to abject poverty and absolute penury. Aben Ezra attributes this disaster (ver. 9) to hostile invasion: "At its season when I shall bring the enemies, to take away the corn and the wine;" Kimchi, on the other hand, sees in it a misgrowth: "I will return and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its appointed time, because I will send a curse upon them in the time of harvest and at the season of vintage, instead of the blessing I used to send upon them. And so on all the work of their hands I shall send a curse, and all their gain shall be put into a bag with holes; and they shall not have bread to eat nor raiment to wear." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will take back</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My grain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1490;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#257;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
