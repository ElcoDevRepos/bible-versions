The term "provoked bitter anger" indicates a deep-seated rebellion against God, characterized by idolatry and injustice. This phrase reflects the historical context of Israel's persistent disobedience and the worship of Baal, which angered God. The prophets frequently warned Israel of the consequences of their actions, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>, where similar language is used to describe Israel's rebellion.<p><b>so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt upon him</b><br>The term "bloodguilt" refers to the guilt incurred from acts of violence and injustice, particularly shedding innocent blood. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, bloodguilt required atonement or divine retribution. The phrase suggests that God, as the sovereign judge, will not absolve Ephraim of their sins without repentance. This aligns with the principle found in <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>, where the land is defiled by bloodshed and requires justice. The concept of God leaving the bloodguilt upon Ephraim underscores the seriousness of their sin and the inevitability of divine judgment.<p><b>and repay him for his contempt</b><br>The word "contempt" here signifies a deep disrespect and disregard for God's covenant and commandments. This phrase indicates that God will enact justice by repaying Ephraim according to their deeds, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> and <a href="/psalms/94-2.htm">Psalm 94:2</a>. The idea of divine retribution is central to the prophetic message, emphasizing that God's patience has limits and that persistent sin will lead to consequences. This repayment is not only punitive but also serves as a call to repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the Northern Kingdom of Israel, often used as a synonym for Israel in the prophetic books.

The northern kingdom, nicknamed Ephraim, had persisted in idolatry and political scheming despite repeated prophetic calls to return (<a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>; 11:2). Each shrine to Baal, each alliance with pagan nations, was not a minor lapse but a personal affront to the Lord who had redeemed them (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-3</a>). Scripture often describes such rebellion as stirring God&#8217;s jealousy or wrath, the way <a href="/deuteronomy/32-19.htm">Deuteronomy 32:19-21</a> portrays Israel provoking Him with foreign gods. When sin is cherished instead of confessed, bitterness accumulates&#8212;much like <a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a> warns, &#8220;Do not harden your hearts.&#8221; Ephraim&#8217;s stubborn pattern of provocation shows that ongoing disobedience eventually fills up a cup of divine anger (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So his Lord</b><p>The verse shifts: &#8220;so his Lord&#8230;.&#8221; The use of &#8220;his Lord&#8221; underscores ownership and authority; Yahweh is not merely Israel&#8217;s distant deity but the covenant Master to whom they are morally accountable (<a href="/leviticus/25-55.htm">Leviticus 25:55</a>). <a href="/hosea/2-16.htm">Hosea 2:16</a> reminds Israel that the same Lord they spurn is the One who longs to be called &#8220;My Husband.&#8221; Yet covenant privileges bring covenant responsibilities. When subjects reject their rightful Lord, they forfeit the protective blessings that come with His rule (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>). The title also hints at final judgment: &#8220;The LORD of hosts is exalted in judgment&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-16.htm">Isaiah 5:16</a>). Ephraim&#8217;s behavior has forced the Lord to act as Judge rather than Shepherd.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will leave his bloodguilt upon him</b><p>The sentence continues, &#8220;will leave his bloodguilt upon him.&#8221; Instead of lifting guilt through sacrifice and mercy, God will let the weight of every unrepented sin rest squarely on Ephraim. <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a> declares that bloodshed defiles the land and &#8220;no atonement can be made&#8230;except by the blood of the one who shed it.&#8221; Because the nation ignored God&#8217;s appointed means of cleansing (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>), bloodguilt remains. <a href="/jeremiah/51-35.htm">Jeremiah 51:35</a> shows a similar principle: wrongdoing that is not covered will return on the offender&#8217;s own head. In practical terms, Assyria&#8217;s invasion (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6-18</a>) would become the historical outworking of the spiritual verdict. What God leaves, no human power can remove (<a href="/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And repay him for his contempt</b><p>Finally, the Lord promises to &#8220;repay him for his contempt.&#8221; Contempt&#8212;treating holy things as trivial&#8212;invites recompense. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> echoes the timeless principle: &#8220;God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, he will reap.&#8221; <a href="/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a> had already spelled out the seed and harvest pattern: &#8220;You have plowed wickedness; you have reaped injustice.&#8221; The repayment is not vindictive but just, aligning with <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, &#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay.&#8221; By scorning God&#8217;s prophets (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>) and dismissing His patience, Ephraim wrote its own sentence. Yet even judgment displays God&#8217;s faithfulness to His word (<a href="/psalms/119-75.htm">Psalm 119:75</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/12-14.htm">Hosea 12:14</a> traces a sobering progression: persistent rebellion provokes divine anger; the covenant Lord must respond; unconfessed guilt remains on the sinner; and contempt for God is paid back in full. The verse affirms that God&#8217;s holiness demands justice, yet His warnings are merciful invitations to repent before judgment falls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) But the rift in the clouds closes again, and another severe rebuke follows.
