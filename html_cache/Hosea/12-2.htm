The term "charge" implies that Judah is being held accountable for its actions. Historically, Judah was the southern kingdom, distinct from Israel (the northern kingdom), and often fell into idolatry and disobedience despite having the temple in Jerusalem. This charge reflects God's covenant relationship with His people, where disobedience leads to divine discipline. The prophets frequently warned Judah of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness, as seen in Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>He will punish Jacob according to his ways</b><br>"Jacob" here symbolizes the entire nation of Israel, both Judah and the northern kingdom. The use of "Jacob" recalls the patriarch whose life was marked by struggle and transformation, reflecting the nation's own spiritual journey. The phrase "according to his ways" suggests that the punishment is a direct consequence of their actions, emphasizing the principle of sowing and reaping found throughout Scripture (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). This reflects God's justice, where the people's behavior determines their fate, as seen in the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>and repay him according to his deeds.</b><br>This phrase underscores the concept of divine retribution, where God repays individuals and nations based on their actions. It echoes the biblical theme of justice, where God is portrayed as a righteous judge who cannot overlook sin. The idea of repayment is consistent with the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, which teaches that one's actions have consequences. This principle is also evident in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of rewards and punishments based on one's deeds (<a href="/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>). Theologically, this highlights God's holiness and the seriousness of sin, calling for repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is just and righteous, bringing charges against His people for their unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, representing the people who are being called to account for their actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Refers to the patriarch Jacob, whose name is often used to represent the nation of Israel as a whole.

He is not speculating; He is presenting evidence of covenant breach.<p>&#8226; This scene echoes <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2&#8211;3</a>, where the heavens and earth are summoned as witnesses: &#8220;Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD has spoken.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a> offers the same legal language: &#8220;For the LORD has a case against His people.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Hosea has already outlined the offenses&#8212;idolatry, injustice, empty ritual (<a href="/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1&#8211;2</a>; 6:6). By stating &#8220;charge,&#8221; the Lord reminds Judah that every covenant promise (<a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>) carries matching covenant consequences.<p>The point is clear: God&#8217;s accusations are factual, not conjecture. His perfect righteousness demands He address sin, even among His chosen people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will punish Jacob according to his ways</b><p>&#8220;Jacob&#8221; stands for the entire nation&#8212;both Israel and Judah&#8212;linking their present conduct to their patriarch&#8217;s name. The Lord declares that judgment will match behavior.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a> affirms this principle: &#8220;I, the LORD, search the heart &#8230; to give to each man according to his ways.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> restates it: &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/34-11.htm">Job 34:11</a> adds, &#8220;For He repays a man according to his deeds.&#8221;<p>The warning is not random wrath; it is measured justice. Every lie, alliance with pagan powers, and act of oppression has been tallied. God&#8217;s discipline is precise, not capricious.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And repay him according to his deeds</b><p>Recompense closes the circle of divine justice. What Judah has done in secret will now be answered openly.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a> underscores this truth: &#8220;You, O Lord, reward each man according to his work.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a> asks, &#8220;Will He not repay each man according to his deeds?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a> repeats it for every era: &#8220;He will repay each one according to his deeds.&#8221;<p>Yet Hosea&#8217;s prophecy never ends in despair. The same Lord who repays also restores (<a href="/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1&#8211;2</a>). Discipline aims to draw His people back, just as <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a> reminds us, &#8220;For the Lord disciplines the one He loves.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a> pictures God as the flawless Judge who files an airtight case against Judah, announces punishment that fits their conduct, and ensures full recompense for every deed. His justice is exact, His standards unchanging, and His goal ultimately redemptive: to turn wandering hearts back to Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Jacob</span> refers to the northern kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath also a controversy with Judah; and will punish</span> (margin, <span class="accented">visit</span> <span class="accented">upon</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Jacob according to his ways</span>. God here presents himself at once as plaintiff and judge, widening the range of his pleadings. The controversy with Israel takes a wider sweep, and comprehends Judah culpable, though apparently in a less degree. But though Judah comes in for a share of punishment, that punishment shall be proportionate to their delinquencies - those like Judah that sinned less shall suffer less; while the more heinous transgressors, such as Israel had proved to be, would come in for severer punishment. To Jacob, here embracing the ten tribes of Israel and the two of Judah, the chastisement would be meted out in exact accordance with his ways. The apparent contradiction between ver. 12 of last chapter, where, as most translate it, Judah is represented as ruling with God and being faithful with the saints, and the present inclusion of Judah in controversy with Jehovah, occasioned <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a rendering and explanation of this verse which Aben Ezra declares to be both ungrammatical and unscriptural. "He" says Aben Ezra." who explains that Judah is faithful and he shall be reproving, and asserts that Scripture makes no mention of Jehovah having a controversy against Judah, but [employs] <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span> the sense being that Jehovah and Judah have a strife against Ephraim, errs from the way of Scripture and grammar, for the prophet has written above (ver. 13), 'Judah saw his wound;' 'I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plough;' and in reference to both of them he says,' Ye shall eat the fruit of lies.' He also forgets 'The herdmen of Gerar did strive with (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span>) Isaac's herdmen;' 'And the people strove with Moses;' and many other places [i.e. where <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span> is found with the sense of 'contending']. Therefore he joins Ephraim with Judah, and says, 'The Lord hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways, because this name (i.e. Jacob) comprehends them both (Ephraim and Judah)." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The meaning is given concisely and correctly by Rashi thus: "He (Jehovah) announces to them the words of his controversy which their brethren of the house of Israel had caused him; and they should not wonder if he would punish (literally, 'visit on') Jacob according to his ways." The change in the case of Judah, Kimchi accounts for by reference to their subsequent apostasy, especially that of their kings, as follows: "Although he said, 'And Judah yet reigneth with God,' he meant, although be holds fast by the service of God in the house of the sanctuary; so afterwards they practiced evil deeds as their kings were evil; therefore he said,' Jehovah has a controversy and correction with Judah and Jacob to visit upon them according to their doings, as their kings were evil, for they did not remember my mercy with them and with their father Jacob, because the whole was for sake of his posterity; and I showed him a sign which should be to his seed after him, if they gave their heart to me.... And the sign which I showed them is only done for sake of his seed. But they have not acknowledged this, for if they had acknowledged this, they would have cleaved to me and my service, and I would have ratified to them the blessing of Jacob their father.'" The infinitive with <span class="accented">le</span> is not infrequently employed in the sense of our future, thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e4;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;</span>, it is to be visited, equivalent to "he shall or must visit upon it' This idiom is common in Syriac, but always with <span class="accented">atid</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>According to his doings will he recompense him.</span> The milder expression is applied to Judah - he has a controversy with him, but will punish Jacob, restricted by some to Ephraim or the ten tribes. Better understand Jacob of both Judah and Israel, who are both to be recompensed, each according to his works. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/12-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD also [brings]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
