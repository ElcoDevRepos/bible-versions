In biblical context, the land often reflects the spiritual state of its inhabitants. The mourning of the land can be seen as a metaphor for the desolation and barrenness resulting from the people's disobedience to God. This concept is echoed in passages like <a href="/isaiah/24-4.htm">Isaiah 24:4-6</a>, where the earth suffers due to the inhabitants' transgressions. The land's mourning signifies a broken covenant relationship between God and His people, as the land was promised to be blessed if they followed His commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-6</a>).<p><b>and all who dwell in it will waste away</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive impact of sin, affecting not just the land but all its inhabitants. The term "waste away" suggests a gradual decline and deterioration, both physically and spiritually. Historically, this can be linked to the consequences of idolatry and injustice prevalent in Israel at the time. The wasting away of the people serves as a warning of the judgment that comes from turning away from God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-20</a>, where disobedience leads to various curses, including disease and famine.<p><b>with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air</b><br>The inclusion of animals in this judgment underscores the extent of the curse. In the creation narrative, animals were part of the harmonious order established by God (<a href="/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24-25</a>). Their suffering and decline reflect the disruption of this order due to human sin. This connection between human sin and environmental impact is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/12-4.htm">Jeremiah 12:4</a>, where the land mourns and animals perish because of the wickedness of its people. It serves as a reminder of humanity's role as stewards of creation and the consequences of failing in that role.<p><b>even the fish of the sea disappear</b><br>The mention of fish emphasizes the totality of the ecological disaster. In the ancient Near East, fish were a vital food source and symbolized abundance and provision. Their disappearance signifies a severe depletion of resources, leading to economic and social distress. This imagery is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt, where the Nile turned to blood, and fish died (<a href="/exodus/7-18.htm">Exodus 7:18-21</a>), symbolizing divine judgment. Theologically, it points to the ultimate restoration and redemption of creation through Christ, who calms the seas and provides abundantly (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, <a href="/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>), foreshadowing the new creation where harmony is restored (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's ministry was marked by his call to the Israelites to return to God amidst their unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, leading to divine judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Represents the physical territory of Israel, which suffers due to the people's sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/beasts,_birds,_and_fish.htm">Beasts, Birds, and Fish</a></b><br>Symbolize the entirety of creation affected by human sinfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The event of divine retribution due to Israel's persistent disobedience and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has far-reaching effects, impacting not only individuals but the entire creation.

Its purpose is redemptive&#8212;to awaken hearts, compel repentance, and restore covenant blessing (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) The mourning of the land is the judgment of famine, which follows not only upon the living men, but upon all living things (the LXX. have introduced into the enumeration the creeping things of the earth). Even the fishes of the sea are swept away. There is plague on fish as well as murrain on cattle, and starvation of the birds of heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-5.</span> - These verses relate, with much particularity, the sufferings consequent on sins, especially such as are specified in the preceding verses. <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">montaging of the land</span> mentioned in ver. 3 may be understood either figuratively or literally. If in the former way, there are many Scripture parallels which represent nature in full accord with human feelings, sympathizing with man, now in joy, again in sorrow; for example: "The little hills rejoice on every side;" the valleys "shout for joy, they also sing;" on the other hand, "The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish." But if the expression be taken literally, it conveys a solemn fact, and one in perfect harmony with the entire tone and character of the old economy, according to which moral evil transmutes itself into physical evil, and impresses itself in dismal characters on the face of inanimate nature. The Hebrew commentators seem to understand the statement literally; thus Rashi: "The land shall be laid waste, and there shall be great mourning;" likewise Kimchi: "The land of Israel shall be laid waste and desolated." The latter has this further comment: "After the land of Israel shall have been laid waste, man and beast shall be cut off out of it. But under the beasts of the field the prophet does not mean the wild beasts, but the large domestic animals which dwell with the sons of men, likewise called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span>. It is also possible that even the beasts that roam at largo are included, for the wild beast does not come to inhabited places that are laid waste, unless they are partially inhabited." He also adds, in reference to the fowls of heaven, "When he speaks of the fowls of heaven, it is because most of the fowls do not dwell in the wilderness, but in inhabited places, where they find seeds and fruits and blossoms of trees. Or the fowls of heaven are mentioned by way of hyperbole to represent the matter in its totality; and, according to this sense, it is used in the Prophet Jeremiah; and it explains itself in like manner in one of these two ways." With the mourning of the land the dwellers therein languish. Nor is this languishing condition confined to rational beings; it comprises the irrational as well, and that without exception. The dominion assigned man at the beginning over the whole creation of God is here reversed in the case of Israel; while the denunciation of wrath has that reversal for its dark background. The terms of the dominion to man by the Creator are, "Have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth;" but in this denunciation these terms are reversed and read backwards, being," with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also." Thus all nature, inanimate and animate, and all creation, rational and irrational, are involved in the consequences of Israel's sin. The particles "yea, even," preceding "the fishes of the sea" (such as the Sea of Galilee or other inland seas and rivers), show the entirely unexpected as well as unusual nature of the event. The Chaldee paraphrases the clause as follows: "And even the fishes of the sea shall be diminished in number, on account of their (Israel's) sins." Earth refuses sustenance to man and beast, no longer yielding grass for the cattle or herb for the service of man; the waters of the sea, being lessened by drought or becoming putrid by stagnation, no longer supply their accustomed quota of fishes for human food. An illustration of the literal sense has been quoted by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Pusey from Jerome. It is the following: "Whoso believeth not that this befell the people of Israel, let him survey Illyricum, let him survey the Thraces, Macedonia, the Pannonias, and the whole land which stretches from the Propoutis and Dosphorus to the Julian Alps, and he will experience that, together with man, all the creatures also fail, which afore were nourished by the Creator for the service of man." The <span class="accented">le</span> before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span>is explained by Abarbanel in the sense of <span class="accented">through</span>, as though the inhabitants would be slain by wild beasts: by Hitzig as <span class="accented">extending to</span>; by Keil as <span class="accented">of</span> in enumeration. It is simply <span class="accented">with</span>. Ver. 4 looks like an interjected clause, coming in the middle of the enumeration of Divine judgments; and the purpose is not so much to justify the severity of those judgments as to intimate their inefficacy, owing to the incorrigible character of the people. There is <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the rendering of the Authorized Version, Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another. This seems to show that mutual reproof was out of place, since one was as bad as another; or that every one was to look to his own sins, and not throw the blame on others; but this rendering is not tenable nor capable of being supported by such an expression as <span class="accented">ish beish</span>.
