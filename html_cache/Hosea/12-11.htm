Historically, it was a place of refuge and healing, yet here it is questioned for iniquity. This rhetorical question implies the presence of sin and corruption, contrasting its reputation. The region's spiritual decline reflects Israel's broader unfaithfulness to God, as seen in other prophetic writings like <a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>, where Gilead's balm is mentioned in the context of spiritual sickness.<p><b>They will surely come to nothing.</b><br>This phrase indicates the futility of Gilead's iniquity. Despite their efforts and prosperity, their actions will lead to emptiness and destruction. This echoes the biblical principle that sin ultimately leads to ruin, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, which warns that the way that seems right to a man ends in death. The prophetic message is clear: without repentance, their endeavors will be fruitless.<p><b>Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal?</b><br>Gilgal was a significant site in Israel's history, associated with the Israelites' first encampment after crossing the Jordan and the renewal of the covenant (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-24</a>). However, it became a center of idolatrous worship, as indicated in <a href="/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>. The mention of sacrificing bulls suggests a continuation of ritualistic practices devoid of true devotion to God, highlighting the people's misplaced trust in religious formalism rather than genuine faith.<p><b>Indeed, their altars will be heaps of stones in the furrows of the field.</b><br>This imagery of altars becoming heaps of stones signifies the destruction of their places of worship. The altars, once central to their religious practices, will be reduced to rubble, scattered like stones in a plowed field. This prophecy underscores the judgment awaiting those who forsake God for idolatry. It also serves as a reminder of the impermanence of human constructs compared to the eternal nature of God's covenant, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>, which contrasts the fleeting nature of human endeavors with the enduring word of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and fertile land.

In Gilgal they sacrificed bullocks; their altars also are like heaps upon the field's furrows,</span> referring to a past event, the desolating invasion of Gilead by Tiglath-pileser, in 734 B.C. To this military expedition we have undoubted references in the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser II. But unfortunately they are in a very mutilated condition. From one passage we learn:--"The city Gil [ead] and [A] bel [Maacha] which is on this side the land Beth Omri (Samaria) the distant . . . I joined in its whole extent to the territory of Assyria." The biblical passage, <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>, supplements this account by stating that Napntali and Galilee also fell victims to the victorious arms of the invader. From the verse before us we infer that Gilgal, on the western bank of the Jordan near Jericho (see Note on 4:15), likewise felt the heavy hand of the conqueror, or perhaps the inhabitants fled in panic and the local shrines became deserted ruins. From this time forth we hear no more of Gilgal as a religious centre. Nowack, however, follows Ewald in regarding the passage as prophetic of a coming calamity.
