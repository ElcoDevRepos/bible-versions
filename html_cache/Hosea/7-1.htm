The healing implies a return to spiritual health and covenant faithfulness. In the broader biblical narrative, God's healing often follows repentance and turning back to Him (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The concept of healing is also seen in the ministry of Jesus Christ, who healed physical ailments as a sign of spiritual restoration (<a href="/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>).<p><b>the iniquity of Ephraim will be exposed</b><br>Ephraim, representing the northern kingdom of Israel, is often used as a synonym for the entire nation. The exposure of iniquity suggests a divine revelation of sin, bringing hidden transgressions to light. This exposure is a necessary step for true repentance and aligns with the biblical theme that nothing is hidden from God's sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><b>as well as the crimes of Samaria</b><br>Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom, symbolizes the political and spiritual corruption prevalent in Israel. The mention of crimes highlights the moral decay and injustice that characterized the society. Historically, Samaria was known for its idolatry and alliances with pagan nations, which led to its downfall (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>).<p><b>For they practice deceit</b><br>Deceit here refers to the pervasive dishonesty and betrayal among the people. This deceit is not only interpersonal but also reflects a betrayal of their covenant with God. The prophets frequently condemned Israel for their deceitful ways, which were contrary to God's truth (<a href="/jeremiah/9-6.htm">Jeremiah 9:6</a>).<p><b>and thieves break in</b><br>This phrase illustrates the lawlessness and lack of security within the society. The imagery of thieves breaking in suggests a breakdown of social order and justice. It also serves as a metaphor for spiritual theft, where false teachings and idolatry rob the people of true worship (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p><b>bandits raid in the streets</b><br>The presence of bandits raiding in the streets indicates a society in chaos, where violence and crime are rampant. This reflects the consequences of turning away from God's laws, leading to societal disintegration. The imagery of bandits can also be seen as a type of spiritual enemy, akin to the forces of darkness that oppose God's kingdom (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often used to represent the collective people of God who have turned away from Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>The largest tribe in the northern kingdom, often used as a synonym for Israel, highlighting its significant role in the nation's spiritual decline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital city of the northern kingdom, representing the political and spiritual center of Israel's apostasy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/deceit_and_crime.htm">Deceit and Crime</a></b><br>The moral and spiritual corruption prevalent in Israel, characterized by dishonesty and lawlessness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/thieves_and_robbers.htm">Thieves and Robbers</a></b><br>Symbolic of the pervasive sin and societal breakdown, indicating both literal and spiritual theft and violence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_healing_reveals_sin.htm">God's Healing Reveals Sin</a></b><br>When God begins to heal and restore, it often exposes underlying sin that must be addressed.

We may, with some, understand this healing of those <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> prophetic admonitions and rebukes by which God designed to cure the transgressions and heal the backslidings of his people. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is more probable, however, that the reference is to the partial restoration of the national prosperity in the days of Jeroboam II., who "restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain." <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Jerome's exposition is not so natural when he says, "The sense is: When I wished to blot out the old sins of my people, on account of ancient idolatry, Ephraim and Samaria discovered new idols;" the old sins and ancient idolatry he refers to the making and worshipping of the golden calf in the wilderness, while the new idols were the calf-worship which Jeroboam of the tribe of Ephraim instituted, and the people of the capital, Samaria, adopted. When God would heal, or as often as he proceeded to heal, Israel, the evils broke out afresh, or came more fully to light, just like a wound the dangerous nature of which is discovered by the surgeon's probe in the effort to heal it. <span class="cmt_word">Then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria.</span> The sin of the northern kingdom manifested itself in high quarters - in the premier tribe of Israel, and in the capital city of Samaria. "Because," says Abort Ezra, in his comment, "they said, He hath torn, and he will heal us, he says, When I was disposed to heal them, the wickedness concealed in their heart stood before my face, which they have not left off until the present time, for they practice falsehood; by night they steal, and by day troops (of bandits) spread themselves outside the cities." Similarly, Rashi explains: "When I was willing to help and to heal them, their iniquities manifested themselves before me, for they practiced lying constantly; while thieves of their number entered in continually, and stole the wealth of their companions, and even their gangs spread themselves for robberies to rob men." <span class="cmt_word">For they commit falsehood</span>; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth (margin, <span class="accented">strippeth</span>) without. Here follows an enumeration of the crimes of which they were guilty. There was falsehood, or fraud, or deception generally, and that, not only in words, but in works; next comes dishonesty, both in public and in private. The thief privately entered the houses, and committed burglary; gangs of highwaymen publicly infested the roads, spoiling the passers-by, or rather roamed or spread themselves abroad for plunder, since it is the causative conjugation of <span class="accented">pashat</span> that has the signification of stripping or spoiling others. The thief within, the rubber robs without. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When I would heal</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
