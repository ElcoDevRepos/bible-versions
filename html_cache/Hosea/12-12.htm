Aram, also known as Padan-Aram, is located in the region of modern-day Syria. This journey marks a significant turning point in Jacob's life, as it is during his time in Aram that he encounters God in a dream at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-22</a>). The flight to Aram is a reminder of God's providence and protection over Jacob, despite his deceptive actions. It also sets the stage for the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, as Jacob's time in Aram leads to the expansion of his family, which becomes the nation of Israel.<p><b>and Israel worked for a wife</b><br>The name "Israel" here refers to Jacob, who was later named Israel after wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). This phrase highlights Jacob's labor for Laban, his uncle, in order to marry his daughters, Leah and Rachel (<a href="/genesis/29-15.htm">Genesis 29:15-30</a>). This period of service lasted fourteen years, seven years for each wife. The labor Jacob endured is symbolic of the trials and perseverance required to fulfill God's promises. It also foreshadows the future struggles of the nation of Israel, which would often find itself in servitude and hardship due to disobedience, yet always under God's sovereign plan.<p><b>for a wife he tended sheep</b><br>Jacob's work as a shepherd during his time in Aram is significant both culturally and theologically. Shepherding was a common occupation in the ancient Near East, and it required patience, diligence, and care&#8212;qualities that God would later require of the leaders of Israel. This role as a shepherd also prefigures the imagery of God as the Shepherd of Israel (Psalm 23) and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). Jacob's tending of sheep is a humble task that underscores the theme of servitude and foreshadows the servanthood of Christ, who came not to be served, but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who fled to Aram to escape his brother Esau's wrath.

And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved</span>. The connection of this verse with what precedes has been variously explained. The flight of Israel and his servitude are intended, according to Umbreit, "to bring out the double servitude of Israel - the first, the one which the people had to endure in their forefather; the second, the one which they had to endure themselves in Egypt." Cyril and Theodoret understand them to give prominence to Jacob's zeal for the blessing of the birthright, and his obedience to the command of God and his parents. Pusey says, "Jacob chose poverty and servitude rather than marry an idolatress of Canaan. He knew not whence, except from God's bounty and providence, he should have bread to eat or raiment to put on; with his staff alone he passed over Jordan. His voluntary poverty, bearing even unjust losses, and repaying the things which he never took, reproved their dishonest traffic; his trustfulness in God, their mistrust; his devotedness to God, their alienation from him and their devotion to idols." There may be an element of truth in each of these explanations, and an approximation to the true sense; but none of them tallies exactly with the context. There is a contrast between the flight of the lonely tribe-father across the Syrian desert, and the guidance of his posterity by a prophet of the Lord through the wilderness; Jacob's servitude in Padan-aram with Israel's redemption from the bondage of Egypt; the guarding of sheep by the patriarch with the Shepherd of Israel's guardian-care of them by his prophet when he led them to Canaan. Thus the distress and affliction of Jacob are contrasted with the exaltation of his posterity. The great object of this contrast is to impress the people with the goodness of God to them in lifting them up out of the lowest condition, and to inspire them with gratitude to God for such unmerited elevation and with thankful yet humble acknowledgment of his mercy. Calvin's explanation is at once correct and clear; it is the following: "Their father Jacob, who was he? what was his condition? He was a fugitive from his country. Even if he had always lived at home, his father was only a stranger in the land. But he was compelled to fit into Syria. And how splendidly did he live there? He was with his uncle, no doubt, but he was treated quite as meanly as any common slave: he served for a wife. And how did he serve? He was the man that tended the cattle." This, it may be observed, was the lowest and the meanest, the hardest and worst kind of servitude. In like manner Ewald directs attention to the wonderful care of Divine providence manifested to Jacob in his straits, in his flight to Syria, in his sojourn there as a shepherd, and also to Israel his posterity delivered out of Egypt by the hand of Moses an, I sustained in the wilderness so that one scarcely knows what to think of Israel who, without encountering such perils and distresses, and out of sheer delight in iniquity, so shamefully forsook their benefactor. Such is the substance of Ewald's view, which presents one aspect of the ease, though he does not bring out so fully the fact of Israel's elevation and the humble thankfulness that should be exhibited therefore. The exposition of the Hebrew commentators agrees in the main with what we have given. Rashi says, "Jacob fled to the field of Aram, etc., as a man who says, 'Let us return to the former narrative which we spoke of above;' and he wrestles with the angel; and this further have I done unto him; as he was obliged to fly to the field of Aram ye know how I guarded him, and for a wife he kept sheep." "Ye ought to consider," says Aben Ezra, "that your father when he fled to Syria was poor, and so he says, 'And he will give me bread to eat' (<a href="/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>). And he served for a wife,' and this is, 'Have I not served thee for Rachel?' 'And for a wife he kept sheep ;' and ' f made him rich.'" The exposition of Kimchi is much fuller, and is as follows: "And they do not remember the goodness which I exercised with their father, when he fled from his brother Esau. Yea, when he was there it was necessary for him to serve Laban for a wife, that he should give him his daughter, and the service consisted in keeping his sheep, and so for the other daughter which he gave him he kept his sheep in like manner. And I am he that was with him and blessed him, so that he returned thence with fiches and substance. And further, I showed favor to his sons who descended into Egypt and were in bondage there; and I sent to them a prophet who brought them up out of Egypt with much substance, and he was Moses. The forty years they were in the wilderness they were guarded by means of a prophet whom I gave them, and they wanted nothing. But all these benefits they forget, and provoke me to anger by abominations and no-gods." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/12-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7687;&#183;ra&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
