The covenant relationship between God and Israel is often depicted as a marriage, with unfaithfulness symbolizing idolatry and turning away from God (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>). The Hebrew word for "unfaithful" can also mean "to act treacherously," indicating a deliberate betrayal. This unfaithfulness is not just a personal failing but a national one, reflecting the collective sin of the people.<p><b>for they have borne illegitimate children.</b><br>The "illegitimate children" symbolize the fruit of Israel's idolatry. In a literal sense, this could refer to children born from unions with pagan nations, but metaphorically, it represents the spiritual offspring of their unfaithfulness&#8212;corrupt practices and beliefs. This imagery is consistent with Hosea's earlier use of family metaphors, such as Gomer's unfaithfulness and the names of Hosea's children (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2-9</a>). The concept of illegitimacy underscores the impurity and unacceptability of their actions before God.<p><b>Now the New Moon will devour them along with their land.</b><br>The New Moon was a time of celebration and worship in Israel (<a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10, 28</a>:11-15). However, here it is turned into a time of judgment. The phrase suggests that what was meant to be a time of renewal and blessing will instead bring destruction. This inversion of expectation serves as a warning of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness. The "devour" imagery indicates total consumption, leaving nothing behind, which aligns with the prophetic warnings of exile and devastation (<a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5-10</a>). The mention of "their land" emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the judgment, affecting both the people and the land they inhabit, fulfilling the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is portrayed as being betrayed by His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, engaging in idolatry and alliances with foreign nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/illegitimate_children.htm">Illegitimate Children</a></b><br>Symbolic of Israel's spiritual adultery and unfaithfulness, resulting in offspring that do not belong to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_moon.htm">New Moon</a></b><br>A time of religious observance in Israel, here representing a period of judgment rather than celebration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_adultery.htm">Spiritual Adultery</a></b><br>Just as Israel was unfaithful to God, believers today must guard against idolatry and spiritual compromise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The judgment described in Hosea serves as a warning that sin has real and devastating consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/true_worship.htm">True Worship</a></b><br>God desires genuine worship and obedience, not mere ritualistic observance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>Believers are called to remain faithful to their covenant relationship with God, reflecting His faithfulness to us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Despite judgment, God's ultimate desire is for His people to return to Him and be restored.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hosea_5_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hosea 5:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_5_7_Israel_s_unfaithfulness.htm">How does Hosea 5:7 illustrate Israel's unfaithfulness to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_5_7_Israel_s_betrayal_results.htm">What consequences does Hosea 5:7 describe for Israel's betrayal of God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_5_7_s_relevance_to_today_s_faith.htm">How can Hosea 5:7's warning apply to modern Christian faithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Hosea_5_7_to_1st_commandment.htm">What connections exist between Hosea 5:7 and the first commandment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Prevent_spiritual_betrayal.htm">How can we guard against spiritual "treachery" in our own lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_5_7_on_Israel_s_God_relationship.htm">What does Hosea 5:7 reveal about Israel's relationship with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_5_7_Unfaithfulness_outcome.htm">How does Hosea 5:7 illustrate the consequences of unfaithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_illegitimate_children_in_Hos_5_7.htm">Why is the imagery of "illegitimate children" used in Hosea 5:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_hosea_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Hosea 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/hosea_5_7__proof_of_israel's_unfaithfulness.htm">Hosea 5:7 &#8211; What proof exists that Israel literally bore &#8220;illegitimate children&#8221; due to religious unfaithfulness rather than political alliances? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_fuels_prostitution's_essence.htm">What drives the essence of prostitution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_1_sam_20_5_with_ot_feasts.htm">How do we reconcile the timing of the New Moon feast in 1 Samuel 20:5 with other Old Testament passages referencing similar observances?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_remarriage_adultery.htm">Is a second marriage considered adultery?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Hosea 5:7 Mean</div><b>They have been unfaithful to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Hosea highlights covenant betrayal.
