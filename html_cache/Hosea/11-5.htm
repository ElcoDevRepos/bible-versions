Egypt often represents a place of exile and punishment in the Bible. The Israelites' deliverance from Egypt was a foundational event in their history, and returning there signifies a reversal of God's redemptive work. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual backsliding, where the people of Israel are turning away from God and returning to their former ways of sin and idolatry.<p><b>and be ruled by Assyria</b><br>Assyria was a dominant power during the time of Hosea, known for its military might and harsh rule. Historically, the Assyrian Empire conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722 BC, leading to the exile of many Israelites. This phrase indicates a prophetic warning of impending judgment and subjugation due to Israel's disobedience. Assyria, like Egypt, becomes a symbol of God's judgment on His people for their unfaithfulness. The Assyrian captivity is a pivotal event that underscores the consequences of Israel's refusal to follow God's commandments.<p><b>because they refused to repent?</b><br>Repentance is a central theme in the prophetic books, emphasizing a return to God and His ways. The refusal to repent highlights Israel's persistent rebellion and hard-heartedness. This phrase underscores the conditional nature of God's covenant with Israel, where blessings are contingent upon obedience. The call to repentance is echoed throughout Scripture, with prophets urging the people to turn from their sins and seek God's forgiveness. This refusal ultimately leads to judgment, as seen in the exile and suffering that follows. The concept of repentance is also significant in the New Testament, where it is a key aspect of the message of Jesus Christ and the apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which is being addressed by God through the prophet Hosea.

What sounds ironic is tragically literal&#8212;running to the old oppressor instead of running to the Lord.<p>&#8226; At heart, &#8220;Egypt&#8221; also embodies the broader idea of life outside God&#8217;s covenant care&#8212;any place of self-chosen bondage (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>).

The power of Assyria would be paramount; instead, therefore, of native kings and Egyptian auxiliaries, Israel would have to submit to that iron yoke. However desirous of returning to Egypt, they would have neither the power nor the privilege of doing so. And this poor privilege of a choice of masters they were refused as a just retribution, because they had not repented of their sin and returned to God. Various methods have been resorted to, to harmonize the apparent contradiction alluded to, that is, between the affirmative and negative statements about Israel's return into Egypt. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Dathe, Eichhorn, and De Wette agree with the LXX. in reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, and connecting it with the preceding verse;
