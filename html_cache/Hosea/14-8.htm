The rhetorical question signifies God's rejection of idolatry, a recurring sin in Israel's history. The context is a call to repentance and a return to the covenant relationship with God. Idolatry was prevalent in the ancient Near East, and Israel's adoption of these practices led to spiritual adultery. This echoes the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and the call to exclusive worship of Yahweh.<p><b>It is I who answer and watch over him.</b><br>God declares His role as the one who responds to the needs of His people and provides protection. This assurance contrasts with the impotence of idols, which cannot hear or act (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>). The phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and faithfulness, highlighting His active involvement in the lives of His people. The imagery of God as a watchful guardian is consistent with His covenant promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>).<p><b>I am like a flourishing cypress;</b><br>The cypress tree, known for its strength and evergreen nature, symbolizes enduring life and prosperity. In the arid climate of the Middle East, a flourishing tree represents sustenance and stability. This metaphor illustrates God's provision and the life-giving relationship He offers. The cypress may also allude to the temple's construction materials (<a href="/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a>), symbolizing God's presence and blessing.<p><b>your fruit comes from Me.</b><br>This phrase underscores the source of Israel's blessings and prosperity. It is a reminder that all good things come from God (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The imagery of fruitfulness is often used in Scripture to describe spiritual growth and the results of a righteous life (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).
