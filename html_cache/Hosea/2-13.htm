The Baals were fertility deities, and their worship often involved immoral practices. This idolatry was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and a betrayal of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The punishment signifies God's justice and His intolerance of idolatry, reflecting His desire for Israel's repentance and return to faithfulness.<p><b>when she burned incense to them</b><br>Burning incense was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religious rituals, symbolizing prayers or offerings to the gods. In the context of Israel, this act was a form of worship that should have been directed solely to Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-9</a>). The use of incense in worshiping the Baals highlights the depth of Israel's apostasy and spiritual adultery, as they adopted pagan practices contrary to God's commands.<p><b>when she adorned herself with rings and jewelry</b><br>Adorning with rings and jewelry suggests preparation for a significant event or relationship, often associated with marriage or courtship. In this context, it symbolizes Israel's attempt to attract and please the false gods, akin to a bride preparing for her groom. This imagery underscores the betrayal of Israel, as they sought after other gods instead of remaining faithful to Yahweh, their true husband (<a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>).<p><b>and went after her lovers</b><br>The term "lovers" metaphorically represents the foreign nations and their gods that Israel pursued, forsaking their covenant with Yahweh. This pursuit of other deities is likened to adultery, emphasizing the unfaithfulness of Israel. The prophets frequently used marital imagery to describe Israel's relationship with God, portraying idolatry as spiritual infidelity (<a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>).<p><b>But Me she forgot,&#8221; declares the LORD</b><br>Forgetting God indicates a deliberate neglect of the covenant relationship and the blessings and laws given to Israel. This forgetfulness is not merely a lapse in memory but a willful disregard for God's presence and commandments. The declaration by the LORD highlights His personal involvement and the pain of being forgotten by His chosen people.

The verse warns against gradual drift and invites renewed loyalty to the One who alone deserves our incense, adornment, and affection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The days of Baalim.--</span>The plural Baalim refers to the worship of the same deity in different places, with distinguishing local characteristics. Thus there was a Baal-Zephon, a Baal-Hermon, a Baal-Gad, &c. (See W. R. Smith, <span class= "ital">Old Testament in the Jewish Church,</span> p. 229.) "The days of Baalim" mean the whole period during which Baal has been worshipped by the faithless Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forget me, saith the Lord.</span> The name of Baalim, that is, Baals in the plural, has respect to the various forms of the Baal-idolatry,or modification of the Baal-worship; for example, Baal-peor, Baal-be-rith, Baal-zebub, Baal-perazim, Baal-zephon, Baal-zamar, Baal-shalishu. The name of Baal came to be used generally as the designation of any idol or false god. The days of the Baals were the days consecrated to Baal, and on which the worship of the true God was transferred to that idol. It matters little whether we render "wherein" or "to whom," referring to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, in which case, however, we should expect <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5dd;</span>, though the latter answers better to the meaning of the preposition <span class="accented">le</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span>. After mentioning the object of their idolatrous worship, he specifies the manner of it, which was the burning of incense, the part of the process being employed by synecdoche for the whole. Every <span class="accented">mincha</span>, or meat offering, which was presented by itself as a free-will offering was accompanied with frankincense; every day, morning and evening, incense was burnt in the holy place; while on the great Day of Atone-meat the high priest carried a censer of coals from the golden altar into the holiest of all and there burnt incense before the mercy-seat. But the word has often a wider sense than that of burning incense, and is applied to the offering of any sacrifice whatever. Just as the festivals of Jehovah were transferred to Baal, so his service was turned into that of Baal. Titus Israel prostituted herself and acted the part of a spiritual adulteress by her worship of idols. The same unsavory figure is resumed; and her assiduous efforts to worship the idol acceptably and propitiate his favor is presented under the figure of a whorish woman decking herself with meretricious ornaments - nose-rings and jewels, thus making up by artificial means for the lack of natural beauty - to attract the attention and gain the admiration of her lovers. Thus Aben Ezra: "The meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span> is metaphorical in allusion to a whorish woman who puts a nose-ring in her nose and a necklace on her neck to make herself beautiful, in order to find favor in the eves of the adulterer." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> has for its verbal root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;&#x5d4;</span>, to overstep the boundary, transgress, plunder, draw to one's self, put on; while <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, (masculine <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;</span>) is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, to rub, polish, be smooth. But when all fails to draw lovers unto her, she casts aside the last remaining fragment of female delicacy, and goes in pursuit of lovers. Thus did Israel. She put Baal or other idols in place of Jehovah; she made a transfer of Jehovah's festivals to Baal; she burnt incense or offered sacrifice to her idol instead of the true God; she went to great pains to secure the acceptance of her false deities; "and <span class="accented">me</span>," says Jehovah very emphatically," <span class="accented">she forgat</span>;" that is, me the true God, her bountiful Benefactor, her gracious Lord. and loving Husband, she forgot. The visitation expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;</span> with accusative of the thing, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> before the person, is commented by Kimchi as follows: "For the transgressions of her (Israel's) iniquity in the exile I will visit upon her the time that she served Baalim; and I will let them remain long in exile for punishment, because they have left my service and served other gods. And even upon children's children shall come this punishment, although they do not serve strange gods in exile; thus is the sentence [literally, 'judgment'] of their punishment, because their children's children shall not be perfect in the service of God and in his commandments in exile, therefore thus shall the iniquity of their fathers who served strange gods unite with their own punishment." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will punish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;qa&#7695;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
