The "Baals" refer to the various local deities worshiped in Canaan, often associated with fertility and agriculture. The worship of Baal was a significant issue in Israel, leading to spiritual adultery against Yahweh. This removal indicates a cleansing process, where God seeks to restore Israel's faithfulness to Him alone. The act of removing these names symbolizes a deeper transformation of heart and allegiance. In biblical context, this reflects the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and the call to exclusive worship of Yahweh. The removal of Baal worship is also a prophetic act pointing to a future time of spiritual renewal and purity, aligning with the New Covenant promises found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people.<p><b>no longer will their names be invoked.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete eradication of Baal worship from Israel's practices. To "invoke" a name in ancient times was to call upon a deity for help, blessing, or guidance, indicating a relationship or dependency. By stating that these names will no longer be invoked, God is declaring an end to Israel's reliance on false gods. This reflects a return to covenant faithfulness, where Israel will call upon the name of the Lord alone (<a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>). Theologically, this points to the exclusivity of worship due to God and foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the mediator of a new and better covenant (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>). The eradication of idolatry is a theme that resonates throughout the prophetic literature, highlighting God's desire for a pure and devoted relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC.

God vows to uproot that habit.<p>&#8226; This is a gracious, sovereign act: &#8220;I will remove.&#8221; The same Lord who once scattered their language at Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7-9</a>) now purifies it so they may call on His name with &#8220;purified lips&#8221; (<a href="/zephaniah/3-9.htm">Zephaniah 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical outworking:<p>&#8211; No divided loyalties (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>&#8211; No syncretistic language that blends Yahweh with false gods (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21, 39</a>).<p>&#8211; New vocabulary shaped by truth, not culture (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no longer will their names be invoked</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;No longer will their names be invoked&#8217;&#8221;.
