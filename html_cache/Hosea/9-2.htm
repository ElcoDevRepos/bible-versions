The threshing floor was where grain was separated from chaff, and the winepress was used to extract juice from grapes. These were symbols of abundance and God's provision. However, in this context, they represent a withdrawal of divine blessing due to Israel's unfaithfulness. The imagery suggests a time of famine and scarcity, reminiscent of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38-40</a>, where disobedience leads to agricultural failure. This phrase underscores the consequences of Israel's idolatry and spiritual adultery, as they have turned away from God, the true source of their sustenance.<p><b>and the new wine will fail them</b><br>New wine, a symbol of joy and celebration, often represents God's blessing and prosperity (<a href="/proverbs/3-10.htm">Proverbs 3:10</a>). In this passage, its failure signifies the loss of joy and divine favor. The new wine failing indicates that even the initial stages of harvest, which should bring hope and promise, will be disappointing. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given by the prophets, where reliance on foreign alliances and false gods leads to emptiness and despair (<a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8-9</a>). The failure of new wine also points to a deeper spiritual barrenness, as Israel's pursuit of other deities leaves them spiritually unfulfilled. This can be contrasted with the New Testament portrayal of Jesus as the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>), who provides spiritual nourishment and joy to those who abide in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.

(<a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>) echoes the same judgment.<p>&#8226; Similar scenes of ruined grain appear in <a href="/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17</a> &#8211; &#8220;The storehouses lie in ruins; the granaries are broken down.&#8221; When covenant faithfulness collapses, God withholds the very staples His people once took for granted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The winepress</b><p>&#8226; The winepress processed grapes into wine&#8212;symbol of joy, celebration, covenant blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Here, however, it joins the threshing floor in barrenness. <a href="/isaiah/5-10.htm">Isaiah 5:10</a> foretells the same reversal: &#8220;Ten acres of vineyard will yield only one bath of wine.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God is telling His people that the joys they pursued apart from Him will be squeezed dry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will not feed them</b><p>&#8226; Grain and wine normally &#8220;feed&#8221; both body and spirit, yet idolatrous Israel will find them powerless to satisfy.<p>&#8226;

Earlier in <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8-9</a> God said, &#8220;I lavished on her grain, new wine, and oil&#8230; therefore I will take back My grain in its time and My new wine in its season.&#8221; The threat in 9:2 is the fulfillment of that warning.<p>&#8226; In practical terms:<p>&#8211; Prosperity without obedience is short-lived.<p>&#8211; Sensual pleasures can never substitute for covenant relationship.<p>&#8211;

By withdrawing the essentials of life and celebration, God exposes the futility of relying on blessings while ignoring the Blesser. The verse calls believers to trust the Lord for provision, obey His covenant, and remember that real satisfaction flows only from relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Winepress</span>.--Read <span class= "ital">wine-vat</span> (with margin), into which the <span class= "ital">tirosh,</span> new wine (" grape-juice "), flowed from the winepress.

The floor and press - whether wine-prom, or rather oil-press, as the mention of new wine follows - are put for their contents by a common figure of speech. The expression, "fail in her," is literally, "lie to her," and has many parallels; as, "The labor of the olive shall fail [margin, 'lie']," and Horace's "fundus mendax," equivalent to "a farm that belies his hopes." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The threshing floor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#333;&#183;ren)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1637.htm">Strong's 1637: </a> </span><span class="str2">A threshing-floor, open area</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and winepress</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1497;&#1462;&#1430;&#1511;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;ye&#183;qe&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3342.htm">Strong's 3342: </a> </span><span class="str2">A trough, a wine-vat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">feed them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;&#8216;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7462.htm">Strong's 7462: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tend a, flock, pasture it, in, to graze, to rule, to associate with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the new wine</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#238;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8492.htm">Strong's 8492: </a> </span><span class="str2">Must, fresh grape-juice, fermented wine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will fail them.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7733;a&#183;&#7717;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3584.htm">Strong's 3584: </a> </span><span class="str2">To disappoint, deceive, fail, grow lean</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/hosea/9-2.htm">OT Prophets: Hosea 9:2 The threshing floor and the winepress won't (Ho Hs Hos.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/hosea/9-1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Hosea 9:1"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 9:1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/hosea/9-3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Hosea 9:3"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 9:3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
