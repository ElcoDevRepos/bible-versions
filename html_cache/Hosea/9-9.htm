This corruption is not superficial but deeply ingrained, suggesting a willful and persistent turning away from God's commandments. The depth of their corruption implies a complete departure from the covenant relationship with God, reflecting a heart hardened against divine instruction. This mirrors the condition of humanity described in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.<p><b>as in the days of Gibeah</b><br>This reference to Gibeah recalls the events in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-21</a>, where the men of Gibeah committed a heinous crime against a Levite's concubine, leading to civil war and near destruction of the tribe of Benjamin. The mention of Gibeah serves as a historical parallel, highlighting the severity of Israel's current sins. It underscores the idea that the nation has reverted to a time of lawlessness and moral chaos, similar to the period of the Judges when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>He will remember their guilt</b><br>The phrase indicates that God is fully aware of Israel's transgressions and holds them accountable. In biblical terms, "remembering" often implies action based on past deeds. This is not a passive recollection but an active acknowledgment that leads to divine judgment. It contrasts with God's promise to "remember no more" the sins of those who repent (<a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>), emphasizing the unrepentant state of Israel.<p><b>He will punish their sins</b><br>This statement affirms the certainty of divine retribution. God's justice demands that sin be addressed, and punishment is a consequence of persistent disobedience. The punishment is not arbitrary but a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for those who forsake God's law. It serves as a warning and a call to repentance, reminding the people of the seriousness of their rebellion against God. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption through Jesus Christ, who bore the punishment for sin on behalf of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin, infamous for the moral corruption and violence described in <a href="/bsb/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-21</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often rebuked by prophets for idolatry and moral decay.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who judges sin but also offers redemption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The divine response to Israel's persistent sinfulness, as exemplified by the reference to Gibeah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_depth_of_corruption.htm">The Depth of Corruption</a></b><br>Israel's corruption is likened to the days of Gibeah, indicating a profound moral decay.

Comparable echoes appear in <a href="/hosea/10-9.htm">Hosea 10:9</a>, where the prophet says, &#8220;You have sinned since the days of Gibeah&#8221;, underscoring that Israel has learned nothing from that dark chapter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will remember their guilt</b><p>God&#8217;s remembrance is not passive recollection; it is purposeful. &#8226; While He promises to &#8220;remember their sins no more&#8221; when repentance and atonement are present (<a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-17.htm">Hebrews 10:17</a>), here the people refuse to turn back. &#8226; <a href="/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a> shows the same concept: &#8220;Nevertheless, in the day I punish, I will punish their sin.&#8221; &#8226; Divine memory secures moral accountability; what is unconfessed remains on the record until it is dealt with in God&#8217;s way (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-5</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will punish their sins</b><p>Judgment is neither arbitrary nor spiteful; it is the necessary outcome of God&#8217;s holiness. &#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> affirms the same principle: &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked.
