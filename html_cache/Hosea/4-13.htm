The mountaintops were seen as closer to the divine realm, making them popular sites for sacrifices. This practice was contrary to God's command to worship at the designated place He chose, which was the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>). The use of high places often led to syncretism, blending the worship of Yahweh with pagan practices.<p><b>and burn offerings on the hills,</b><br>Burnt offerings were a significant part of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. However, performing these offerings on the hills, rather than at the temple, indicates a departure from true worship. This reflects a broader pattern of disobedience and idolatry, as seen in the practices of the Canaanites, whom the Israelites were supposed to drive out (<a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>).<p><b>under oak, poplar, and terebinth,</b><br>These trees were commonly associated with Canaanite fertility rites and idol worship. The shade provided by these trees made them attractive locations for illicit religious activities. The use of specific trees in worship highlights the influence of surrounding pagan cultures on Israel, which often led to spiritual adultery (<a href="/judges/3-5.htm">Judges 3:5-7</a>).<p><b>because their shade is pleasant.</b><br>The pleasant shade symbolizes the allure of idolatry and false worship. It suggests that the Israelites were drawn to these practices for comfort and convenience, rather than out of true devotion to God. This reflects a broader theme in Hosea of Israel's unfaithfulness and pursuit of immediate gratification over covenantal faithfulness (<a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>).<p><b>And so your daughters turn to prostitution</b><br>Prostitution here is both literal and metaphorical, representing Israel's unfaithfulness to God. In the context of pagan worship, ritual prostitution was a common practice, believed to ensure fertility and prosperity. This phrase underscores the moral and spiritual decay resulting from idolatry, as the people forsake their covenant with God (<a href="/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>).<p><b>and your daughters-in-law to adultery.</b><br>Adultery is used metaphorically throughout Hosea to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God. The mention of daughters-in-law highlights the pervasive nature of this unfaithfulness, affecting all levels of society. This mirrors the spiritual adultery of Israel, who has broken their covenant with God by turning to other gods (<a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often engaged in idolatry and unfaithfulness to God during Hosea's time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountaintops_and_hills.htm">Mountaintops and Hills</a></b><br>Common locations for pagan worship and idolatrous practices in ancient Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/oaks,_poplars,_and_terebinths.htm">Oaks, Poplars, and Terebinths</a></b><br>Trees often associated with pagan worship sites due to their shade and perceived sacredness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prostitution_and_adultery.htm">Prostitution and Adultery</a></b><br>Metaphors for Israel's spiritual unfaithfulness, as well as literal practices associated with pagan worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry's_allure.htm">Idolatry's Allure</a></b><br>The Israelites were drawn to idolatry because of its immediate pleasures and comforts, symbolized by the pleasant shade of the trees.

The verse is a sober reminder that where we worship and whom we worship inevitably shape how we live&#8212;and that idolatry, however scenic, always produces heartbreak.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) The tops of the hills were continually chosen for idolatrous temples, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "high places."<p><span class= "bld">Poplar</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the white poplar, not the <span class= "ital">storax</span> of the LXX., which is a shrub only a few feet high.<p><span class= "bld">Elms</span> should be "terebinth tree" ('<span class= "ital">?lah</span>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good.</span> The prophet here enlarges on the sin of idolatry mentioned in the preceding verse, and explains fully how it showed itself in the public life of the people. Two places are specified as scenes of idolatrous worship: one was the tops of mountains and hills; the other under every green tree, here specified as oaks, poplars, and terebinths, whether growing alone or in groves, in vale or upland. The hills and mountain-tops were selected on account of their elevation, as though the worshippers were thus brought nearer to the objects of their adoration; the green trees as affording shade from the scorching heat of an Eastern sun, secrecy for their licentious rites, and a sort of solemn awe associated with such shadow. In such scenes they not only slew victims, but burnt odors in honor of their idols. The resemblance to, if not imitation of, the rites of heathenism in all this is obvious. Among the Greeks the oak was sacred to Jupiter at Dodona, and among the old Britons the Druidical priests practiced their superstitions in the shadow of the yaks. The poplar again was sacred to Hercules, affording a most grateful shade; while in <a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a> we read that "under every thick terebinth" was one of the places where "they did offer sweet savor to their idols." The inveterate custom of these idolaters is implied in the Piel or iterative form of the verb; the singular of the nouns, <span class="accented">under oak and poplar and terebinth</span>, intimates that scene after scene of Israel's sin passes under the prophet's review, each exciting his deep indignation; the mention of the goodly shadow seems designed to heighten that feeling of just indignation, as though it came into competition or comparison with "the shadow of the Almighty," the abiding-place of him that "dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High." <span class="cmt_word">Therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses</span> (properly, <span class="accented">daughters-in-law</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall commit adultery</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> primarily signifies "bride," but for the parents of the bridegroom, "daughter-in-law," its secondary sense. The bad example of the parents acts upon their children and reacts upon themselves; on their children in causing bad conduct, on themselves by way of chastisements. The parents had been guilty of spiritual whoredom by their idolatry; their daughters and daughters-in-law would commit whoredom in the literal and carnal sense. This would wound the parents' feelings to the quick and pain them in the tenderest part. Their personal honor would be compromised by such scandalous conduct on the part of their daughters; their family honor would be wounded and the fair fame of posterity tarnished by such gross misconduct on the part of the daughters-in-law. The following observations are made on the last member of this thirteenth verse by the Hebrew commentators: "Because the men of the house go out of the city to the high mountains and under every green tree there to serve idols, therefore their daughters and daughters-in-law have opportunity to commit whoredom and adultery" (Kimchi). To like purpose Aben Ezra writes: "The sense is - On the bare mountains and so on the hills they sacrifice; they say to the priests of Baal that they shall sacrifice; and therefore, because the men go out of the cities in order to burn incense, the daughters and daughters-in-law remain in the houses behind, therefore they commit whoredom." Somewhat different is the explanation of Rashi: "<span class="accented">Because</span> ye <span class="accented">asso</span>ciate for idolatry after the manner of the heathen, and the heathen associate with you, and ye form affinities with them, your daughters also who are born to you by the daughters of the heathen conduct themselves after the manner of their mothers, and commit whoredom." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They sacrifice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;zab&#183;b&#234;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2076.htm">Strong's 2076: </a> </span><span class="str2">To slaughter for sacrifice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the mountaintops</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and burn offerings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;qa&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6999.htm">Strong's 6999: </a> </span><span class="str2">To smoke, turn into fragrance by fire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
