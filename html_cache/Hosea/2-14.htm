The use of "behold" emphasizes the significance of this divine action. The word "allure" suggests a gentle and loving persuasion, akin to courtship, highlighting God's desire for a restored relationship with His people. This reflects God's grace and mercy, despite Israel's unfaithfulness. The imagery of allure is reminiscent of the romantic pursuit, underscoring the covenant relationship between God and Israel, akin to a marriage.<p><b>and lead her to the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness is a place of both testing and renewal in biblical history. It recalls Israel's journey after the Exodus, where they experienced God's provision and guidance. The wilderness represents a place of solitude and reflection, away from distractions, where God can speak directly to His people. Historically, the wilderness was a place of purification and preparation, as seen in the lives of figures like Moses and Elijah. This setting implies a return to foundational truths and a stripping away of idolatry and distractions.<p><b>and speak to her tenderly</b><br>This phrase conveys God's compassionate and gentle communication with Israel. The tenderness indicates a shift from judgment to reconciliation. It reflects God's enduring love and willingness to forgive, despite Israel's previous infidelity. The language of tenderness is often used in Scripture to describe God's relationship with His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>, where God comforts His people. This tender speech is a promise of hope and restoration, pointing to the ultimate reconciliation through Christ, who embodies God's love and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Represented as an unfaithful wife, Israel is the nation to whom Hosea's prophecies are directed, symbolizing their spiritual adultery and God's desire for their repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His intention to restore and renew His relationship with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>A place of solitude and testing, often used in Scripture as a setting for divine encounters and transformation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/allurement.htm">Allurement</a></b><br>The act of God drawing Israel back to Himself, emphasizing His grace and love despite their unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_pursuit_of_his_people.htm">God's Pursuit of His People</a></b><br>Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God actively seeks to restore the relationship, demonstrating His relentless love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_as_a_place_of_renewal.htm">The Wilderness as a Place of Renewal</a></b><br>Often seen as a place of desolation, the wilderness is where God speaks tenderly and renews His covenant with His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_allurement.htm">Divine Allurement</a></b><br>God's method of drawing us back to Him is not through force but through love and gentle persuasion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>The call to the wilderness is an invitation to repentance, leading to a deeper, more intimate relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_application.htm">Personal Application</a></b><br>Reflect on areas of life where God might be calling you into a "wilderness" experience for growth and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hosea_2_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hosea 2:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_2_14_God_s_pursuit_of_the_lost.htm">How does Hosea 2:14 illustrate God's pursuit of a wayward believer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_allure_her_show_God_s_healing.htm">What does "allure her" reveal about God's approach to restoring relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Use_wilderness_for_spiritual_growth.htm">How can we apply the concept of "wilderness" in our spiritual growth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Hosea_2_14_Luke_15_4-7_God_s_love.htm">Connect Hosea 2:14 with Luke 15:4-7 on God's redemptive love.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Create_wilderness_to_hear_God_clearly.htm">How can we create "wilderness" moments to hear God's voice more clearly?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_2_14_God_s_redemption_approach.htm">What does Hosea 2:14 reveal about God's approach to redemption and restoration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_2_14_God_s_love_vs_Israel_s_sin.htm">How does Hosea 2:14 illustrate God's love despite Israel's unfaithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Hosea_2_14_challenge_discipline.htm">In what ways does Hosea 2:14 challenge our understanding of divine discipline?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_hosea_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Hosea 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_bridal_paradigm.htm">What defines the concept of the Bridal Paradigm?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_is_hosea_2_3_loving_and_merciful.htm">How does Hosea 2:3 align with a loving and merciful God if He threatens to strip Israel bare like a barren land?

Because He is perfectly righteous, He must address Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness (<a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2-13</a>), yet His covenant love refuses to abandon her. The &#8220;therefore&#8221; signals that grace is not an afterthought; it is the deliberate outcome of love that disciplines to restore, just as a father corrects a child for the child&#8217;s good (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-7</a>). The same pattern is seen when the Lord moved from warning to promise in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and when Jesus turned from rebuke to invitation in <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19-20</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>behold,</b><p>This word arrests attention. The Lord Himself draws the spotlight to what He is about to do, underscoring that restoration is entirely His initiative. Like the &#8220;Behold&#8221; that precedes the promise of the virgin birth (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>) or the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), it urges God&#8217;s people to stop, look, and marvel at His grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will allure her</b><p>&#8226; The language is surprisingly romantic. God woos His wayward bride, not with force but with affection.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a> echoes the same tender strategy: &#8220;I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have drawn you with loving devotion&#8221;.<p>&#8226; In the Gospels, Jesus draws sinners with compassion&#8212;Matthew the tax collector (<a href="/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9-13</a>) and Zacchaeus (<a href="/luke/19-1.htm">Luke 19:1-10</a>) are won by mercy rather than coercion.<p>&#8226; This reminds believers that repentance is a response to divine kindness (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and lead her to the wilderness,</b><p>&#8226; The wilderness recalls Israel&#8217;s honeymoon with God after the Exodus, a season of utter dependence and daily provision (<a href="/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Stripping away distractions, the Lord brings His people to a place where false lovers (idols, alliances, self-reliance) cannot follow.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/2-3.htm">Hosea 2:3</a> had threatened a desolate wilderness as judgment; now the identical setting becomes the workshop of renewal, showing that God can transform former threats into blessings (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus likewise sought solitary places to commune with the Father (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>), demonstrating that wilderness moments can realign the heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and speak to her tenderly.</b><p>&#8226; Literally, He speaks &#8220;to her heart,&#8221; the seat of emotions and will.

He intentionally moves from discipline to restorative grace, captures attention, woos with love, isolates in the wilderness to remove idols, and then speaks intimately to heal the heart. The verse assures every believer that no failure is final when the covenant-keeping Lord decides to allure, lead, and tenderly speak us back to Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Therefore.--</span>This word does not make God's gentle treatment a consequence of the sin of Israel. Some prefer to render by <span class= "ital">nevertheless,</span> but the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">lakh?n</span> is sometimes used in making strong transitions, linked, it is true, with what precedes, but not as an inference. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/10-24.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:24</a>.)

The transition is abrupt. Vers. 14-17 exhibit the gradual change wrought in Israel through the progressive means of improvement employed by Jehovah. Israel's future is here reflected in the mirror of her past history. The events of that history are elegantly employed to represent as by type or symbol the mercies in store for Israel, wayward and rebellious though she had proved herself to be. <span class="accented">Laken</span> (from <span class="accented">le</span> causal, and <span class="accented">ken</span>, so, equivalent to "because it is so") at the beginning of this verse (14) is rendered by some, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "but" or "yet;" but its natural signification is <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "therefore." <p>It is like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> (from <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, Ionic <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, neuter <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, contracted <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>); it being so, therefore, and similar to the Latin phrase, <span class="accented">quae cum ita slut</span>, "therefore" implies because Israel can only be turned from her foolish idolatry by the penal measures named. Aben Ezra also understands it here, as elsewhere, in its literal sense; thus: "After she [the unchaste wife representative of Israel] shall know that all this evil has come upon her because that she had forgotten me, and had not known at the beginning that I dealt kindly with her; and when she will say, 'Yet will I go and return to my former husband;' then will I allure her with words." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5ea;&#x5d4;</span> is from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5ea;</span> cognate with the Arabic in the sense of "dividing," "being open," "standing open;" thence it signifies "to be susceptible of outward impressions," "allow access and entrance;" in Piel, "to make one open.... be susceptible or inclined," "induce by words." The word <span class="accented">laken</span>, "therefore," has somewhat puzzled commentators, because the connection between the judgments threatened in the preceding verses and the mercies proffered in what follows is not to a superficial view at once apparent. Yet it is mercy and truth meeting together, righteousness and peace kissing each other.
