In the biblical context, arrogance often leads to a departure from God's ways (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). Israel's arrogance is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where it is seen as a barrier to repentance and restoration. The testimony against them is not just from external observers but is evident in their own behavior and the consequences they face. This pride is contrasted with the humility required to seek God (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>yet they do not return to the LORD their God</b><br>Despite the clear evidence of their wrongdoing and the consequences they face, Israel fails to repent and return to God. The call to return to the LORD is a central theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing God's desire for reconciliation and restoration (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>). The historical context shows that Israel often turned to foreign alliances and idols instead of seeking God, which led to their downfall. This failure to return is a rejection of the covenant relationship established at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).<p><b>despite all this, they do not seek Him</b><br>The phrase underscores Israel's persistent refusal to seek God, even in the face of judgment and calamity. Seeking God involves a wholehearted pursuit of His will and presence (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>). The cultural context of the time included various religious practices and deities, which often distracted Israel from exclusive worship of Yahweh. This lack of seeking is a spiritual blindness and stubbornness that prevents them from experiencing God's mercy and deliverance. The call to seek God is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus invites all to seek and find (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, representing the ten tribes that split from Judah.

Still, Israel ignores Him, showing that external religion without repentance is empty (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Bullet points of what &#8220;return&#8221; would look like:<p>&#8211; Confession of sin (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>)<p>&#8211; Abandoning idols (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>)<p>&#8211; Renewed trust in God&#8217;s covenant promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1&#8211;3</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>despite all this, they do not seek Him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;All this&#8221; includes plagues, political chaos, and prophetic warnings (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a>).

If with Keil and others <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we understand "the pride of Israel" to mean Jehovah the glory of Israel, and take the verb in the sense of "testify," the meaning will be that Jehovah bore witness to the face of Israel by the weakening and wasting of their kingdom, as portrayed in the preceding verse. We prefer <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to understand "the pride of Israel" in the souse of "the haughtiness" of Israel, and the verb in the sense of "being humbled," as at <a href="/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>. The real meaning, then, is expressed in the following rendering: <span class="accented">And the haughtiness of Israel shall be humbled to his face</span>. This humiliation is the effect of the wasting mentioned in the preceding verse; while the evidence of their humiliation is specified in the succeeding verse by their resorting to Egypt and repairing to Assyria from a consciousness of their helplessness. This rendering is countenanced by the LXX., both here and at <a href="/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>; while Rashi says, "The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d2;&#x5d4;</span> has the meaning of "humiliation." <span class="accented">For all this</span>. This emphasizes the obstinate blindness and perverseness of Ephraim, when, amid all the calamities and miseries of the kingdom both within and without, they turned not to Jehovah to solicit help and deliverance, but concluded treaties or made alliances with foreign nations in hope of being lifted up out of their national impotence. On this Aben Ezra makes the judicious remark: "They turned not to Jehovah as paupers who have nothing more to give foreign nations that they may help them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/7-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Israel&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">arrogance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1456;&#1488;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;wn-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1347.htm">Strong's 1347: </a> </span><span class="str2">Arrogance, majesty, ornament</span><br /><br /><span class="word">testifies</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
