This call to the priests indicates their failure in their duties, as they were expected to be the mediators between God and the people. The rebuke suggests a corruption or negligence in their spiritual leadership, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic books (e.g., <a href="/malachi/2.htm">Malachi 2:1-9</a>).<p><b>Take heed, O house of Israel!</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the northern kingdom, which had separated from Judah after Solomon's reign. This phrase emphasizes the collective responsibility of the nation, highlighting that the entire community is implicated in the wrongdoing. The prophets often addressed the nation as a whole to call them back to covenant faithfulness (e.g., <a href="/amos/3.htm">Amos 3:1</a>).<p><b>Give ear, O royal house!</b><br>The royal house refers to the monarchy, likely the ruling dynasty of the northern kingdom. This call to the royal house underscores the accountability of the leaders, who were expected to govern according to God's laws. The failure of the kings to lead righteously often led the nation into idolatry and injustice (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>).<p><b>For this judgment is against you</b><br>The judgment mentioned here is a divine pronouncement of impending punishment due to the nation's sins. The prophets frequently delivered messages of judgment as a means to call the people to repentance. This judgment is not arbitrary but is a response to specific covenant violations (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>).<p><b>because you have been a snare at Mizpah,</b><br>Mizpah was a significant location in Israel's history, often associated with gatherings for national decision-making or worship (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-6</a>). The reference to a "snare" suggests that the leaders have turned a place of potential spiritual renewal into one of entrapment, possibly through idolatry or false worship practices.<p><b>a net spread out on Tabor.</b><br>Mount Tabor is another significant site, known for its strategic location and its role in Israel's military history (e.g., <a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>). The imagery of a "net" implies deception and entrapment, indicating that the leaders have ensnared the people in sin, leading them away from true worship. This metaphor highlights the leaders' culpability in leading the nation astray.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Israel responsible for spiritual guidance and maintaining the covenant with God.

The house of Israel is the northern kingdom; and the house of the king is the members of the king's family, of his court and of his government. Thus the rulers and the ruled, the spiritual teachers and the taught, are comprehended in this address. Neither priestly office, nor popular power, nor princely dignity was to be exempted. But, though all are summoned to give audience, the heads of the people, the men of light and leading, are first arraigned. For judgment is toward you, as the clause is correctly rendered; not, "it devolves on you to maintain judgment," as some understand it. It had, indeed, been the province of the priest to teach, and of the king to execute the judgments of God in Israel; but now they are themselves the subjects of judgment. Judgment was now to begin at the house of the king and of the priest; God was about to execute judgment upon them - the judgment from that judgment-seat where justice never miscarries, and where no mistake is ever made. The cause of this is assigned. <span class="cmt_word">Because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</span> Instead of being safeguards of the people, they had been a snare to them; instead of being true leaders, as God had intended them, they had misled them; instead of contributing to their security, they had seduced them to sin and so helped to prepare them for destruction; they had been a snare to entrap and a net to entangle. East as well as west of the Jordan their evil influence had wrought ruin. Mizpah, now <span class="accented">es-Salt</span>, was on the east of the river among the hills of Gilead, where Jacob and Laban entered into covenant; Tabor, like a solitary cone or sugar-loaf, rises up from the plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon, on the west of the river.
