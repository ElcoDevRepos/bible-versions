Historically, Israel had a tendency to adopt the idolatrous practices of surrounding nations, despite being chosen by God to be set apart. This reflects the broader theme of Israel's spiritual adultery, as they often turned away from God to worship man-made idols. The reference to "this thing" underscores the specific sin of idolatry that Hosea is addressing.<p><b>a craftsman made it,</b><br>The mention of a craftsman highlights the human origin of the idol, contrasting the living God with lifeless objects made by human hands. This echoes the biblical critique of idolatry found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the absurdity of worshipping something crafted by human hands is pointed out. The craftsmanship involved in idol-making was often skilled, yet it could never imbue the object with divinity or power.<p><b>and it is not God.</b><br>This statement is a direct assertion of the futility and falsehood of idol worship. It reinforces the monotheistic belief central to Israel's faith, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). The declaration that the idol "is not God" serves as a reminder of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>), which prohibits the worship of other gods. This phrase underscores the theological error of equating a created object with the Creator.<p><b>It will be broken to pieces,</b><br>The prophecy of destruction foretells the inevitable downfall of the idol. This reflects the biblical theme that idols, being powerless, cannot withstand the judgment of God. The breaking of the idol symbolizes the futility of trusting in anything other than God. This is consistent with other prophetic warnings, such as those found in <a href="/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>, where idols are destined for destruction.<p><b>that calf of Samaria.</b><br>The "calf of Samaria" refers to the golden calves set up by Jeroboam I in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>) to prevent the Israelites from worshipping in Jerusalem. Samaria, as the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, became synonymous with idolatry and rebellion against God. The calf imagery connects to the sin of the golden calf at Mount Sinai (Exodus 32), highlighting a recurring pattern of idolatry. This phrase serves as a specific indictment of the Northern Kingdom's apostasy and foreshadows its eventual downfall and exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often criticized by Hosea for its idolatry and unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom, representing the center of political and religious life, often associated with idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_calf_of_samaria.htm">The Calf of Samaria</a></b><br>An idol made by human hands, symbolizing Israel's departure from worshiping the true God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/craftsman.htm">Craftsman</a></b><br>Represents human effort and creativity misused to create idols, highlighting the futility of worshiping man-made objects.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_folly_of_idolatry.htm">The Folly of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but can include anything that takes the place of God in our lives.

The prophet here vindicates the justness of Jehovah's complaint and the folly of Israel's conduct. The first clause points out the orion of this idolatry - this god of gold was out of Israel, it proceeded from them and was invented by their kings. The second clause shows that it was of human manufacture; while the natural inference follows in the third clause to the effect that, having its origin with man and being made by man, it could not be God. Or if the rendering, "Thy calf disgusts," be adopted, the <span class="accented">ki</span> introduces the explanation of the disgust which that abomination caused. This idol was of home manufacture, not imported from abroad, as Baal and Ashtaroth from the Sidoniaus, Chemosh from the Moabites, and Moloch from the Ammonites. The Israelites themselves and their king Jeroboam made for the northern kingdom what had been learnt in Egypt. Thus Israel's god was a creature of Israel's own devising. How stupid and how absurd! Israel's god man-made, how enormous and abominable the iniquity! <span class="cmt_word">But the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</span> It shall become splinters; the <span class="accented">hapaz legomenon</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> is derived from an Arabic root, <span class="accented">shaba</span>, to cut; and thus, as the calf at Sinai was burnt and pulverized, the calf of Samaria shall be broken into splinters and destroyed. The whole verse is well explained by Kimchi: "Now ye will see if the calf is able to deliver its worshippers; it cannot even deliver itself, for it shall become splinters, as if he said that the enemies shall break it up and carry it away for the worth of the gold, not for any utility that is in it while it is still in the form of a calf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span> is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (broken pieces, shivers), fragments."
