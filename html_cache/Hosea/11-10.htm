In the context of Hosea, Israel is often depicted as straying from God, engaging in idolatry and unfaithfulness. The promise that they "will walk after the LORD" suggests a future repentance and restoration. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's enduring covenant with His people, despite their repeated failures. Walking after the LORD implies a lifestyle of following His commandments and living in accordance with His will, reminiscent of the call to "walk in His ways" found throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>).<p><b>He will roar like a lion.</b><br>The imagery of God roaring like a lion conveys His power and authority. In the ancient Near East, the lion was a symbol of strength and kingship. This metaphor suggests that God's call is both commanding and awe-inspiring, demanding attention and reverence. The roar signifies a decisive action from God, possibly indicating judgment or a call to return. This imagery is echoed in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>, where the lion's roar is associated with the voice of God bringing about His purposes.<p><b>When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west.</b><br>The response of the children coming "trembling" indicates a mixture of fear and reverence. This trembling can be seen as a recognition of God's majesty and a response to His call. The direction "from the west" may refer to the Israelites returning from exile, as the west could symbolize the lands where they were scattered. Historically, the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles led to the dispersion of the Israelites, and this prophecy envisions their return. The trembling also suggests a heartfelt repentance and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty, similar to the fear and awe experienced by the Israelites at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God as a powerful and authoritative presence, akin to a lion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_children_of_israel.htm">The Children of Israel</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are depicted as responding to God's call with reverence and awe.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lion.htm">The Lion</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's strength and majesty, often used in Scripture to convey His power and authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_west.htm">The West</a></b><br>Represents the direction from which the Israelites will come, symbolizing their return to God from a place of dispersion or exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roar.htm">The Roar</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's call to His people, indicating both a warning and an invitation to return to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_authority_and_power.htm">God's Authority and Power</a></b><br>The imagery of God as a lion emphasizes His supreme authority and power.

But this necessitates a double ellipsis of "<span class="accented">after</span> which." They would go after the Lord in obedience to his summons. That summons is represented as far-reaching and terrible. Calling his people to return, the Lord roars as a lion, to denote at once the loudness of the call, and the awful majesty of the Lord when thus calling his people to return. "<span class="accented">As</span> a lion," says Kimchi, "<span class="accented">which</span> roars that the animals whose king he is may assemble to him, so the Israelites shall assemble on hearing the voice of the Lord when he roars." The roaring of the lion may signify his terrible judgments on Israel's enemies, when he calls his people home from the lands of their dispersion. The result would be a speedy return of his children from the lands of the West - the countries round or beyond the Mediterranean. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/11-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They will walk after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He will roar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1490;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7713;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7580.htm">Strong's 7580: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rumble, moan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like a lion.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
