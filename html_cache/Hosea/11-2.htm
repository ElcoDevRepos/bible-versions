Despite their repeated disobedience, God continually reached out to them through prophets and His law. This reflects God's enduring patience and desire for a relationship with His chosen people. The calling of Israel can be seen throughout the Old Testament, where God repeatedly invites them to return to Him, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>. This calling is a testament to God's covenantal faithfulness, despite Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>the farther they departed from Me.</b><br>Here, the text underscores Israel's increasing rebellion and spiritual apostasy. Despite God's calls, Israel chose to distance themselves, pursuing idolatry and other nations' practices. This departure is not just physical but spiritual, indicating a heart turned away from God. The historical context shows Israel's alliances with pagan nations and their adoption of foreign gods, which led to their downfall. This departure is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where Israel's unfaithfulness is lamented, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/6-9.htm">Ezekiel 6:9</a>.<p><b>They sacrificed to the Baals</b><br>The mention of Baals refers to the Canaanite deities that Israel frequently turned to, despite God's commands against idolatry. Baal worship was prevalent in the ancient Near East and often involved rituals that were abhorrent to God, including child sacrifice and temple prostitution. This idolatry was a direct violation of the first commandment and a significant reason for God's judgment upon Israel. The worship of Baal is a recurring issue in the Old Testament, notably confronted by prophets like Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>.<p><b>and burned incense to carved images.</b><br>Burning incense to carved images signifies the practice of idol worship, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). This act represents a complete turning away from the worship of the one true God to the worship of man-made objects. The use of incense in worship was intended for the tabernacle and temple services, symbolizing prayers rising to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>). However, Israel's misuse of incense in idol worship highlights their spiritual adultery and the perversion of true worship. This practice is condemned throughout the prophetic writings, such as in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/44-3.htm">Jeremiah 44:3-5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's ministry was marked by his call to the Israelites to return to God amidst their unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, engaging in idolatry and turning away from the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baals.htm">Baals</a></b><br>Canaanite deities that the Israelites frequently turned to, representing a significant departure from worshiping Yahweh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/carved_images.htm">Carved Images</a></b><br>Idols made by human hands, which the Israelites worshiped, contrary to God's commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_call.htm">God's Call</a></b><br>The persistent invitation from God to His people to return to Him, despite their continual rebellion and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_persistent_call.htm">God's Persistent Call</a></b><br>Despite Israel's repeated unfaithfulness, God continues to call them back.

The correct reference is that first stated, and the sense is that, instead of appreciating the invitations and monitions of the prophets of God, they showed their utter insensibility and thanklessness, turning away from them in contempt and scorn. Nay, the more the messengers of God called them, the more they turned a deaf ear to those who were their truest friends and best advisers. Pursuing their idolatrous practices, they sacrificed to Baal, that is to say, the various representations of that idol, and burned incense to their images, whether of wood or stone or precious metal. Thus Kimchi correctly comments as follows: "The prophets which I sent to them called to them morning and evening to turn to Jehovah, so (much the more) did they go away from them, not hearkening to their words nor desisting from their evil works." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, even so, denoting the measure or relation, corresponds to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span> to be supplied in the first clause.
