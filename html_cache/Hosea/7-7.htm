In the ancient Near East, ovens were used for baking bread and required a high, consistent heat. This imagery suggests that the people's sinful inclinations are burning intensely and continuously. The metaphor indicates a lack of self-control and a fervent pursuit of wickedness, reflecting the moral and spiritual decay prevalent in Israel at the time. This fervor for sin can be compared to the warnings in <a href="/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27-28</a> about the dangers of unchecked desires.<p><b>and they devour their rulers</b><br>The phrase highlights the destructive consequences of the people's sinful passions, which lead to the downfall of their leaders. Historically, the Northern Kingdom of Israel experienced political instability, with frequent assassinations and coups among its kings. This internal strife is a direct result of the people's rebellion against God, as their unchecked sinfulness leads to chaos and the erosion of leadership. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36-37</a> about the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>All their kings fall</b><br>This statement reflects the historical reality of Israel's political turmoil. The Northern Kingdom saw a rapid succession of kings, many of whom were overthrown or assassinated. This instability is a direct consequence of the nation's spiritual unfaithfulness and serves as a judgment from God. The fall of these kings can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophetic warnings given by earlier prophets, such as Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11-18</a>, about the dangers of rejecting God's rule in favor of human kingship.<p><b>not one of them calls upon Me</b><br>This phrase underscores the spiritual apostasy of the people and their leaders. Despite their dire circumstances, they fail to seek God or repent. This lack of repentance and reliance on God is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, highlighting the stubbornness and pride of the people. The failure to call upon God contrasts with the promises found in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God assures His people of healing and restoration if they humble themselves and seek Him. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate need for a Savior, pointing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who calls all to repentance and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which was experiencing moral and spiritual decline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_israel.htm">Kings of Israel</a></b><br>The rulers of the Northern Kingdom, many of whom were corrupt and led the people away from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who desires repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness from His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The foreign power that would eventually conquer Israel, serving as an instrument of God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_apathy_leads_to_destruction.htm">Spiritual Apathy Leads to Destruction</a></b><br>Just as Israel's leaders fell due to their spiritual negligence, we must be vigilant in our faith to avoid similar downfalls.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_seeking_god.htm">The Importance of Seeking God</a></b><br>Israel's failure to call upon God serves as a warning to us to prioritize prayer and dependence on Him in all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_leadership_failure.htm">Consequences of Leadership Failure</a></b><br>The fall of Israel's kings highlights the responsibility of leaders to guide their people toward righteousness and the consequences of failing to do so.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_desire_for_repentance.htm">God's Desire for Repentance</a></b><br>Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God's heart is for His people to return to Him, reminding us of His grace and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_idolatry.htm">The Dangers of Idolatry</a></b><br>Israel's idolatry led to their downfall, teaching us to guard against modern forms of idolatry that can draw us away from God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hosea_7_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hosea 7:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_7_7_Consequences_of_forsaking_God.htm">How does Hosea 7:7 illustrate the consequences of turning away from God?

The picture is of dough left to rise while embers smolder, ready to flare up.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;heat&#8221; is unrestrained passion&#8212;sinful desires stoked in secret until they burst into open rebellion.
