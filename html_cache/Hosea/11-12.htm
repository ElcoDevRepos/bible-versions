The term "surrounds Me with lies" indicates a pervasive culture of deceit and unfaithfulness towards God. Historically, the northern kingdom was characterized by idolatry and alliances with foreign nations, which were seen as acts of betrayal against God. This phrase highlights the spiritual adultery of Israel, as they professed loyalty to God while worshiping other deities.<p><b>the house of Israel with deceit</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the collective tribes of the northern kingdom. The use of "deceit" underscores the insincerity in their worship and covenant relationship with God. This deceit is not just in their actions but also in their hearts, as they failed to uphold the covenant established at Sinai. The prophets frequently condemned Israel for their duplicity, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God laments that the people honor Him with their lips, but their hearts are far from Him.<p><b>but Judah still walks with God</b><br>Judah, the southern kingdom, is contrasted with Ephraim and Israel. At this point in history, Judah had not yet fallen into the same level of idolatry and apostasy as the northern kingdom. "Walks with God" suggests a closer adherence to the covenant and the Law. This phrase may reflect a temporary state, as later prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel would also call out Judah for similar sins. However, at this moment, Judah is seen as more faithful, possibly due to reforms under kings like Hezekiah and Josiah.<p><b>and is faithful to the Holy One</b><br>The "Holy One" is a title for God, emphasizing His purity and separateness from sin. Judah's faithfulness is highlighted here, suggesting a remnant that remains true to God. This faithfulness is not just in ritual but in a genuine relationship with God. The phrase foreshadows the eventual coming of the Messiah from the line of Judah, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. The faithfulness of Judah is a type of Christ, who perfectly embodies faithfulness to God and fulfills the covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used synonymously with Israel in the prophetic books.

Ephraim (Israel) cloaks itself in lies and deliberate deceit, surrounding God with insincerity, while Judah&#8212;at least for the moment&#8212;lives in comparative faithfulness, walking with and honoring the Holy One.

The rest of the prophecy appears as a distinct composition, a new commencemen, of judgment and incrimination, followed at last by one more utterance of Divine promise.<p>The rendering of the latter part of the verse in the English version was that of the Jewish scholars who saw here a reference to the reign of Hezekiah, but it is opposed to the mention of the "controversy with Judah" in <a href="/hosea/12-3.htm" title="He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:">Hosea 12:3</a>. Accordingly, the rendering adopted by Ewald, Wnsche, Nowack, and others, is more probable:--"And Judah still roves unbridled towards God, and towards the faithful Holy One," Judah's inconstancy being contrasted with the faithfulness of God. The plural form, the Holy Ones, may, like the plural forms, Elohim, Adonim, suggest personalities within the substance of deity. The LXX. seem to indicate that we have not the right Hebrew text here.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.</span> The first clause sets forth the faithlessness and insincerity of Israel, and that in contrast with Judah. Thus understood, the verse properly belongs to the present chapter. But others understand the last clause differently, and deny the contrast, viz.
