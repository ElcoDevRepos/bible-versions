In the ancient Near East, agriculture was a central part of life, and the metaphor of plowing and reaping would have been easily understood. Plowing wickedness suggests deliberate actions and choices that are contrary to God's laws. The result, reaping injustice, indicates the natural consequences of such actions. This reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where it is stated that whatever one sows, that will they also reap. The Israelites' actions have led to societal and spiritual decay, highlighting the justice of God in allowing them to experience the consequences of their sin.<p><b>you have eaten the fruit of lies.</b><br>The fruit of lies refers to the deceptive practices and false beliefs that the Israelites have embraced. In biblical terms, eating often symbolizes internalizing or accepting something. This phrase suggests that the people have consumed and been nourished by falsehoods, leading to their downfall. Lies can refer to idolatry, false prophecies, or reliance on foreign alliances instead of trusting in God. This connects to the broader biblical theme of truth versus falsehood, as seen in <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, where Jesus speaks of the devil as the father of lies. The Israelites' acceptance of lies has led to spiritual malnutrition and corruption.<p><b>Because you have trusted in your own way</b><br>Trusting in one's own way indicates a reliance on human wisdom and strength rather than on God. This self-reliance is a recurring issue in Israel's history, as seen in the book of Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). This phrase highlights the sin of pride and the rejection of divine guidance. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> advises against leaning on one's own understanding, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging God in all ways. The Israelites' trust in their own methods and strategies has led them away from God's path, resulting in their current predicament.<p><b>and in the multitude of your mighty men,</b><br>This phrase points to Israel's misplaced confidence in military strength and numbers. Throughout the Old Testament, Israel is warned against relying on military power instead of God. In <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, kings are instructed not to multiply horses for themselves, symbolizing a reliance on military might. The reference to mighty men suggests a trust in human resources and alliances, which contrasts with the biblical teaching that true security comes from God alone. This misplaced trust is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which states, "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God." The Israelites' dependence on their own military capabilities has led them away from faith in God's protection and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel to repentance and warning of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which had turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and forming alliances with foreign nations instead of trusting in the Lord.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/injustice_and_lies.htm">Injustice and Lies</a></b><br>The consequences of Israel's actions, representing the moral and spiritual decay resulting from their departure from God's ways.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_men.htm">Mighty Men</a></b><br>Refers to the military strength and alliances that Israel relied upon instead of trusting in God for protection and provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wickedness.htm">Wickedness</a></b><br>The sinful behaviors and idolatry that Israel engaged in, which led to their downfall and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Just as Israel reaped injustice from their wickedness, we too will face consequences when we turn away from God's ways.

The Masoretic text gives, however, a fine meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have ploughed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies.</span> Hitherto their course had been the very opposite of that which they are now exhorted to enter on. Hitherto their work had been wickedness, and their wages, as might be expected, the fruit of iniquity. What they had wrought for they reaped. Their plowing had been sin, their sowing wickedness, and their harvest sorrow. Wickedness against God and man was what they both ploughed and sowed; oppression at the hand of their enemies was the harvest or reward of iniquity which they reaped. Their lies, including their idolatry in reference to God, disloyalty to their king, their false words and false works with one another, bore fruit, bitter fruit, sour fruit, and they were obliged to eat that fruit till their teeth were set on edge. Thus Kimchi explains it: "After the plowing follows the sowing, and both of them are a figurative representation of work, as we have explained it. The prophet says, 'Ye have done the opposite of that which I commanded you, when I said, Sow to yourselves in righteousness.'" The harvest is the reward of the work done; the genitive is expressive of contents - that in which the fruit consists; the fruit of lies against God is the fruit which disappoints those who wait for it <span class="accented">Ki</span> directs attention to the ground of Israel's gradual declension and final destruction; the two fundamental errors, or rather evils, that led on to Israel's ruin, were apostasy from Jehovah and sinful self-confidence. Sunk in idolatry, they no longer looked to Jehovah as the Source of their power and strength; while they pursued their own ways, confident of the excellence of their own sagacity and foresight. <span class="cmt_word">Because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</span> They had placed their confidence in the wisdom of their own ways - their prudent plans and wise counsels; in the heroism of their soldiers and the excellence of their preparations of war. By these means they fancied themselves independent of the Almighty, and sufficiently defended against their enemies. "Thou hast trusted," says Kimchi, in his exposition, "to thine own way which thou goest; and that is the way of iniquity and of confidence in evil; and in like manner thou hast trusted in the multitude of thy men of war which thou hast had among thine own people, or among the Egyptians, from whom they sought help, and thou hast made flesh thine arm, and not trusted in me;
