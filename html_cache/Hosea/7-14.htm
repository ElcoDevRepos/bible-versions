The people of Israel were engaging in religious rituals and outward expressions of distress, but their hearts were not truly seeking God. This reflects a common biblical theme where God desires genuine repentance and heartfelt devotion rather than mere external compliance (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>). The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of one's being, encompassing emotions, will, and intellect. God seeks a relationship that is authentic and rooted in love and obedience.<p><b>when they wail upon their beds</b><br>The imagery of wailing upon their beds suggests a private, personal anguish, possibly due to the consequences of their sins or the hardships they were facing. In ancient Near Eastern culture, beds were often places of reflection and lamentation. This phrase indicates that even in their most vulnerable moments, the Israelites were not turning to God with genuine repentance. Instead, their cries were more about their suffering than a true desire to return to God. This can be contrasted with the psalms, where David often cried out to God from his bed in genuine repentance and trust (<a href="/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>).<p><b>They slash themselves for grain and new wine</b><br>This phrase refers to pagan practices that the Israelites had adopted, such as self-mutilation, which was common in Canaanite religious rituals to invoke the favor of their gods (<a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>). The Israelites were seeking material prosperity and sustenance through these idolatrous practices rather than relying on the Lord. Grain and new wine symbolize the basic provisions and blessings that God promised to His people if they remained faithful (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-14</a>). Their actions reveal a misplaced trust in false gods and a departure from the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<p><b>but turn away from Me</b><br>This final phrase underscores the central issue of Israel's spiritual adultery. Despite their religious activities and cries for help, they were turning away from God, the source of true life and blessing. This turning away is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where Israel's unfaithfulness is likened to adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16-32.htm">Ezekiel 16:32</a>). The call to return to God is a central message of the prophets, emphasizing repentance and restoration. This turning away from God is ultimately a rejection of His love and provision, which is fully realized in the person of Jesus Christ, who calls all to turn to Him for salvation (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst widespread idolatry and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which had turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and forming alliances with foreign nations instead of relying on the Lord.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure to whom Israel is supposed to turn.

This rendering is supported by several eminent authorities. Others follow Ewald in translating," they <span class= "ital">excite</span> themselves" with dervish-like devices and cries. The LXX. render with great force, "they cut themselves." (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm" title="And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.">1Kings 18:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-6.htm" title="Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:">Jeremiah 16:6</a>.) This is based on a slightly different reading, contained in some of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., which is not improbably the right one. The charge is that all their simulated penitence is to secure physical comforts, not to show conformity with the Divine will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds.</span> This clause may be more correctly rendered, <span class="accented">They did not cry to me in their heart</span>, <span class="accented">but howl upon their beds</span>. Their falsehood manifested itself in works as well as words; a practical example is here given. They did not, in reality, seek help from God; if they sought at all, it was insincerely. They cried to God, but that cry did not proceed from their heart. They gave vent to their feelings of distress by howlings upon their beds; but those howlings were the expression of unbelief and despair, not by any means evidences of faith. "They do not cry to me," says Aben Ezra, "as the sick man cries to the physician." The comment of Kimchi is still fuller and more explicit: "They have not cried to me in their heart, because of their notion that I do not see their cry nor know what is good or bad for them; but they howl upon their beds, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when they are upon their bed and when they think of that misfortune which is coming upon them.
