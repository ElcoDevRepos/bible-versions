Her inclusion in the "Hall of Faith" underscores the transformative power of faith, regardless of one's past. Rahab's story is found in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>, where she hides Israelite spies. Her faith is remarkable because she believed in the God of Israel despite her background and the pagan culture of Jericho. This demonstrates that faith is accessible to all, regardless of past sins or societal status. Rahab's faith is also a precursor to the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>because she welcomed the spies in peace</b><br>Rahab's actions in welcoming the spies were a demonstration of her faith. She risked her life by hiding them and lying to the king's men, showing her allegiance to the God of Israel over her own people. This act of hospitality and protection was a tangible expression of her belief in God's power and promises. Her peaceful reception of the spies contrasts with the hostility of the rest of Jericho, highlighting her unique faith. This act is reminiscent of the biblical theme of hospitality, seen in stories like Abraham welcoming the angels in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>.<p><b>did not perish with those who were disobedient</b><br>Rahab's faith led to her salvation, both physically and spiritually. While the rest of Jericho perished due to their disobedience and unbelief, Rahab and her family were spared. This mirrors the biblical principle that faith leads to life, while disobedience leads to destruction. Her deliverance is a type of salvation offered through Jesus Christ, where faith in Him saves from eternal judgment. Rahab's story is a foreshadowing of the redemption available to all who believe, regardless of their past.<p><b>with those who were disobedient</b><br>The people of Jericho were disobedient because they did not heed the warnings of God's impending judgment. Their destruction serves as a warning of the consequences of unbelief and rebellion against God. In contrast, Rahab's faith set her apart from her fellow citizens, illustrating the biblical theme that faith, not heritage or nationality, is what aligns one with God's people. This distinction between the obedient and disobedient is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing the importance of faith and obedience to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho, known for her occupation as a prostitute.
