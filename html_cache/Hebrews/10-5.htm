The term "therefore" connects this statement to the preceding discussion about the insufficiency of the Old Testament sacrifices. The coming of Christ into the world signifies the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. The phrase "He said" indicates that the following words are attributed to Christ, emphasizing His divine authority and the fulfillment of prophecy. This reflects the messianic expectation found in the Old Testament, particularly in passages like <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which foretold the coming of a Savior.<p><b>&#8220;Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,</b><br>This phrase highlights the inadequacy of the Old Testament sacrificial system to fully atone for sin. It echoes <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6-8</a>, which is a messianic psalm pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. The sacrificial system was instituted by God as a temporary measure, pointing forward to the perfect sacrifice. The emphasis here is on God's desire for obedience and a heart aligned with His will, rather than mere ritualistic offerings. This aligns with the prophetic critique found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a> and <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, where God expresses His desire for mercy and knowledge of Him over burnt offerings.<p><b>but a body You prepared for Me.</b><br>This phrase underscores the incarnation, where God prepared a physical body for Christ to dwell in. The preparation of a body signifies the unique role of Jesus as both fully God and fully man, enabling Him to be the perfect mediator and sacrifice. This concept is central to the doctrine of the incarnation, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where "the Word became flesh." The preparation of a body also points to the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, as Jesus' physical body would be the means through which He would offer Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, as elaborated in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is portrayed as the fulfillment of God's plan, emphasizing His incarnation and the purpose of His coming into the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one to whom the statement is addressed, highlighting the divine plan and desire beyond the Old Testament sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_testament_sacrificial_system.htm">Old Testament Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The system of sacrifices and offerings that were part of the Mosaic Law, which is being contrasted with the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to the earthly realm into which Christ entered, signifying His incarnation and mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_body_prepared.htm">The Body Prepared</a></b><br>This phrase emphasizes the physical body of Jesus, prepared for the purpose of fulfilling God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_insufficiency_of_old_testament_sacrifices.htm">The Insufficiency of Old Testament Sacrifices</a></b><br>The verse highlights that God did not ultimately desire the sacrifices and offerings of the Old Testament, pointing to their insufficiency in dealing with sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_prepared_body_of_christ.htm">The Prepared Body of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' incarnation was intentional and purposeful, with His body being prepared for the ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>This verse demonstrates the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, affirming the reliability and divine inspiration of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_incarnation's_significance.htm">The Incarnation's Significance</a></b><br>The coming of Christ into the world signifies God's direct intervention in human history, emphasizing the importance of the incarnation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_sacrifices.htm">Living Sacrifices</a></b><br>Believers are called to emulate Christ by offering themselves as living sacrifices, dedicating their lives to God's service.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_10_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 10:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_10_5_Christ_fulfills_sacrifices.htm">How does Hebrews 10:5 emphasize Christ's fulfillment of Old Testament sacrifices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_body_prepared_reveal.htm">What does "a body You prepared for Me" reveal about Jesus' mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Christ_s_obedience_daily.htm">How can we apply Christ's obedience in Hebrews 10:5 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_10_5_links_to_Psalm_40_on_sacrifice.htm">Connect Hebrews 10:5 with Psalm 40:6-8.

Though not directly mentioned here, He has been the subject of the whole context (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25-28</a>). The words which follow are a quotation from <a href="/context/psalms/40-6.htm" title="Sacrifice and offering you did not desire; my ears have you opened: burnt offering and sin offering have you not required.">Psalm 40:6-8</a>, and agree substantially with the LXX., except that in <a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.">Hebrews 10:7</a> a word of some importance is omitted (see the Note there). The LXX., again, is on the whole a faithful representation of the Hebrew text: one clause only (the last in this verse) presents difficulty. Particular expressions will be noticed as they occur: the general meaning and application of the psalm must first receive attention. Like Ps. 1. and 51 (with some verses of Psalms 69), Psalms 40 is remarkable for its anticipation of the teaching of the prophets (<a href="/context/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.">Jeremiah 7:21</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/context/micah/6-6.htm" title="With which shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) on one point, the inferior worth of ceremonial observances when contrasted with moral duties. It seems probable that the psalm is David's, as the inscription relates, and that its key-note is to be found in the words of Samuel to Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm" title="And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.">1Samuel 15:22</a>): "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying (literally, <span class= "ital">hearkening to</span>) the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey (literally, <span class= "ital">to hear</span>) is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." The first part of the psalm is an expression of thanksgiving to God for deliverance from peril. David has learned the true mode of displaying gratitude, not by offerings of slain animals, but by the sacrifice of the will. So far does the latter excel the former, so truly is the sacrifice of will in accordance with the will of God, that the value of the legal offerings is in comparison as nothing. There is in all this no real slighting of the sacrificial ritual (see <a href="/context/jeremiah/7-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.">Jeremiah 7:21-28</a>), but there is a profound appreciation of the superiority of spiritual service to mere ritual observance. It can hardly be said that this quotation rests on the same principle as those of the first chapter. The psalm is certainly not Messianic, in the sense of being wholly predictive like Psalms 110, or directly typical like Psalms 2. In some respects, indeed, it resembles 2 Samuel 7 (See the Note on <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>.) As there, after words which are quoted in this Epistle in reference to Christ, we read of David's son as committing iniquity and receiving punishment; so in this psalm we read, "Mine iniquities are more than the hairs of mine head." David comes with a new perception of the true will of God, to offer Him the service in which He takes pleasure. And yet not so--for such service as he can offer is itself defective; his sins surround him yet in their results and penalties. Hence, in his understanding and his offering of himself he is a type, whilst his sinfulness and weakness render him but an imperfect type, of Him that was to come. Such passages as these constitute a distinct and very interesting division of Messianic prophecy. We may then thus trace the principle on which the psalm is here applied. Jesus came to His Father with that perfect offering of will and self which was foreshadowed in the best impulses of the best of the men of God, whose inspired utterances the Scriptures record. The words of David, but partially true of himself, are fulfilled in the Son of David. Since, then, these words describe the purpose of the Saviour's life, we can have no difficulty in understanding the introductory words, "when He cometh into the world, He saith;" or the seventh verse, where we read, "Lo, I am come to do Thy will." When David saw the true meaning of the law, he thus came before God; the purpose of Jesus, when He received the body which was the necessary instrument for human obedience, finds its full expression in these words. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body didst thou prepare me: In whole burnt offering and offerings for sin thou hadst no pleasure: Then said I, Lo, I am come</span> (in the volume (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> roll) of the book it is written of me) <span class="cmt_word">to do thy will, O God.</span> The quotation is from <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6, 7, 8</a>. It is entitled "a psalm of David," nor is there anything in the psalm itself incompatible with his authorship. The question of authorship is, however, unimportant; all that is required for the purpose of the quotation being that it should have been the utterance of an inspired psalmist. The primary import of the passage quoted is that the psalmist, after deliverance from great affliction, for which he gives thanks, expresses his desire to act on the lesson learnt in his trouble by giving himself entirely to God's service. And the service in which God delights he declares to be, not sacrifices of slain beasts, but the doing of his will, the ears being opened to his Word, and his Law being within the heart. Now, bearing in mind what was said under Hebrews 1:5, of the principle on which words used in the Old Testament with a primary human reference are applied in the New Testament directly to Christ, we shall have no difficulty in understanding such application here. The psalmist, it may be allowed, spoke in his own person, and as expressing his own feelings and desires; but, writing under inspiration, he aspired to an ideal beyond his own attainment, the true ideal for humanity, to be realized only in Christ. The ideal is such perfect self-oblation of the human will to God's as to supersede and render needless the existing sacrifices, which are acknowledged to be, in their own nature, valueless. That the psalmist did not really contemplate the fulfillment of this ideal in himself is evident from the penitential confessions of the latter verses of the psalm. It is but the yearning of inspired humanity for what was really needed for reconciliation with God, such yearning being in itself a prophecy. Hence what was thus spoken in the Spirit is adduced as expressing the mind and work of him who fulfilled all those prophetic yearnings, and effected, as Man and for man, what the holy men of old longed to do but could not. The expression, "when he cometh into the world," reminds us of <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, here used, is connected in thought with the <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> ("I am come") in the quotation. Idle are the inquiries of some commentators as to the precise time, either before or after the Incarnation, at which our Lord is to be conceived as so speaking. Enough to say that his purpose in coming into the world is in these significant words expressed. It is noteworthy, in regard to the attribution of this utterance to him, how frequently he is recorded to have spoken of having <span class="accented">come</span> into the world for the accomplishment of a purpose "genie, vel potius, <span class="accented">vent</span>, symbolum quasi Domini <span class="accented">Jesu</span> fuit" (Bengel). (See <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34, 35</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="/mark/1-38.htm">Mark 1:38</a>; <a href="/luke/9-56.htm">Luke 9:56</a>; <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>; <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>; and especially for close agreement with the language of the passage before us, <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, "I came down from heaven, not to do mine own <span class="accented">will</span>, but the <span class="accented">will</span> of him that tent me;" and <a href="/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>, "I <span class="accented">am come</span> a light <span class="accented">into the world."</span>) The psalm is quoted from the LXX., with slight variation, not worth considering, as it does not affect the sense of the passage. But the variation of the LXX. from the Hebrew text requires notice. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Instead of "a body didst thou prepare for me (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)" of the LXX. and the quotation from it, the Hebrew has "mine ears hast thou opened;" literally, "ears hast thou dug for me," meaning probably, "formed the cavity of my ears through which thy Word may penetrate," equivalent to "given me ears to hear," with reference, of course, to spiritual auscultation. If to the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> be assigned here the sense of <span class="accented">piercing</span>, rather than <span class="accented">hollowing out</span>, implying an entrance affected through the ears already formed, the general sense remains the same. In either case the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> may be accounted for, as being a free rendering, intended to give the meaning of the figure. But the substitution of "body" for "ears" is not so easily accounted for. One conjecture is that some transcriber of the Alexandrian translation of the Hebrew had inadvertently joined the last letter of the preceding word, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, to the following word, <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, and that the <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x399;</span> of <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3a9;&#x3a4;&#x399;&#x391;</span> was then changed into the <span class="greek">&#x39c;</span> of <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3a9;&#x39c;&#x391;</span>, so as to make sense of the word thus formed. But this is only conjecture. That some copies of the LXX. had <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> appears from the fact that the Vulgate, translated from the LXX., reads <span class="accented">aures perfecisti mihi</span>, and that some manuscripts of the LXX. still have <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1fb3;</span>. Thus there can be little doubt that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> was a wrong rendering of the Hebrew, however originating, which the writer of the Epistle found in the copies of the LXX. which he used. For that he himself altered the word to suit his purpose, and that the alteration got into copies of the LXX. from the Epistle, is highly improbable, considering the general accuracy of his quotations, and his purpose of proving his positions from the sacred documents to which his readers could refer. As to the unimportance of any such variations from the original Hebrew in the quotations of the Epistle from the LXX., as long as the argument is not affected, see what is said under Hebrews 1:7 with respect to the quotation from <a href="/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a>. In this case the variation certainly does not affect the argument. For though the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is certainly taken up again in ver. 10 as applicable to Christ, yet the argument of the passage by no means rests on this word, but on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. This is indeed a passage (as was observed under Hebrews 9:14) notable for the very fact that the essence of the atonement is in it represented as consisting, not so much in its physical accompaniments as in its being a spiritual act of perfect self-oblation. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The more probable meaning of the phrase translated in the LXX. and the quotation, "it is written <span class="accented">of</span> me <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)" is in the Hebrew," it is prescribed <span class="accented">unto</span> me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "laid on me as a duty;" this being also the sense in which the same words occur in <a href="/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>, "Great is the wrath of the Lord... because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is <span class="accented">prescribed to us</span>;" where the LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The most obvious reference of the Hebrew psalm is to the Book of the Law generally, in which the duty of fulfilling the Divine will is enjoined, rather than to any <span class="accented">prophecy</span>, applied by the writer to himself individually. If so, it is not necessary to inquire what prophecy about himself David might have had in view; whether e.g. <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>; or <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span> But the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, does certainly rather suggest a <span class="accented">prophecy</span>, and such suggestion is peculiarly appropriate in the application to Christ. Well, then, if here again there is some variation from the original Hebrew text, it is still such as to leave the general argument intact. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/10-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(Dio)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1352.htm">Strong's 1352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wherefore, on which account, therefore.
