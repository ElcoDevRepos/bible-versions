His journey to the promised land was initiated by God's call (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), and it required him to leave his homeland and family. The promised land, Canaan, was significant as it was the land God promised to Abraham and his descendants. Abraham's faith is demonstrated by his willingness to reside in a land that was not yet his possession, trusting in God's promise for the future. This act of faith is a model for believers, emphasizing trust in God's promises even when they are not immediately fulfilled.<p><b>as a stranger in a foreign country</b><br>Abraham's status as a stranger underscores his lack of permanent ownership in the land of Canaan during his lifetime. This reflects the broader biblical theme of believers being sojourners on earth (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>). The cultural context of the ancient Near East often involved strong ties to one's homeland and family, making Abraham's journey and status as a foreigner particularly significant. It also points to the transient nature of life on earth and the anticipation of a heavenly homeland (<a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>).<p><b>He lived in tents</b><br>Living in tents signifies a nomadic lifestyle, which was common for patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Tents symbolize temporariness and mobility, contrasting with the permanence of settled life in cities. This lifestyle reflects Abraham's faith and obedience to God, as he did not build permanent structures in a land that was not yet his. It also serves as a metaphor for the believer's journey through life, emphasizing reliance on God rather than earthly security.<p><b>as did Isaac and Jacob</b><br>Isaac and Jacob, Abraham's son and grandson, continued the legacy of faith and the nomadic lifestyle. They are included in this passage to show the continuity of God's promise through generations. Both Isaac and Jacob received reaffirmations of the covenant God made with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-4</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). Their inclusion highlights the importance of generational faithfulness and the transmission of God's promises through family lines.<p><b>who were heirs with him of the same promise</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenantal promise God made to Abraham, which was passed down to Isaac and Jacob. The promise included land, descendants, and blessing to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The concept of being "heirs" indicates that the promise was not just for Abraham but for his descendants, pointing to the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through history. This promise ultimately finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ, through whom all nations are blessed (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, called by God to leave his homeland and journey to a land that God promised to him and his descendants.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>Abraham's son, who continued to live in the promised land, inheriting the promise given to Abraham.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Isaac's son, who also lived in tents in the promised land and was part of the lineage through which God's promises were fulfilled.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.

The words of which this is a paraphrase are very expressive, especially those of the last clause. Abraham there "made his home once for all, well aware that it was to be his home--expecting no change in this respect all his life long--in tents," movable, shifting abodes--here to-day, there to-morrow--with (as did also in their turn) "Isaac and Jacob," the "heirs with him of the same promise."

The three successive patriarchs are presented in Scripture as representing the period of nomadic life in the land of promise, not yet possessed; alike supported by faith in the Divine word; and hence they are ever grouped together (cf. <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15; 1:24</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-5.htm">Deuteronomy 9:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>, etc.; also <a href="/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>; <a href="/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>). The meaning of their history to us, and the object of their common hope, are further set forth in vers. 13-17, and will be under them considered. In the mean time an instance of Abraham's faith, peculiar to himself, is adduced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By faith</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Pistei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4102.htm">Strong's 4102: </a> </span><span class="str2">Faith, belief, trust, confidence; fidelity, faithfulness. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he dwelt</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8180;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#333;k&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3939.htm">Strong's 3939: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sojourn, dwell in as a stranger.
