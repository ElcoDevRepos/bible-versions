In the context of Hebrews, the author contrasts the blood of animals, which was used in the sacrificial system of the Mosaic Law, with the blood of Christ. The blood of Christ is seen as infinitely more effective in purifying and redeeming humanity. This echoes the theme of Hebrews that Christ is the fulfillment and perfection of the law (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27, 10</a>:4).<p><b>who through the eternal Spirit</b><br>This phrase highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in the sacrificial offering of Christ. The "eternal Spirit" suggests the divine nature and eternal existence of the Holy Spirit, who empowered and sustained Christ in His earthly ministry and sacrificial death. This aligns with the Trinitarian understanding of God, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit work in unity (<a href="/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>).<p><b>offered Himself unblemished to God</b><br>Christ's offering of Himself is central to the Christian understanding of atonement. Unlike the animal sacrifices, which had to be without physical defect, Christ was morally and spiritually unblemished, fulfilling the requirement for a perfect sacrifice (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). This reflects the Old Testament typology of the Passover lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>) and underscores Christ's voluntary and willing sacrifice (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<p><b>purify our consciences from works of death</b><br>The purification of conscience refers to the internal cleansing from sin and guilt, which the Old Testament sacrifices could not achieve (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-2</a>). "Works of death" likely refers to sinful deeds and the dead works of the law that cannot bring life or salvation. This purification is a transformative process, enabling believers to live in righteousness (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><b>so that we may serve the living God!</b><br>The ultimate purpose of Christ's sacrifice is to enable believers to serve God, who is described as "living," contrasting with dead idols (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>). This service is not merely ritualistic but involves a life dedicated to God's will and purposes. It reflects the new covenant relationship where believers are empowered to live out their faith actively and obediently (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons /

The phrase &#8220;how much more&#8221; emphatically declares that Jesus&#8217; work surpasses the old system in power and effectiveness&#8212;just as <a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a> states, &#8220;Having now been justified by His blood, how much more shall we be saved from wrath through Him.&#8221;<p>- The contrast shows God&#8217;s progressive revelation: temporary symbols versus the ultimate reality fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-17.htm">Colossians 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the blood of Christ</b><p>- &#8220;Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).

By most readers of the Authorised version, probably, these words are understood as referring to the Holy Spirit, whose influence continually rested on "the Anointed One of God" (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>). For this opinion there seems to be no foundation in the usage of the New Testament, and it is not indicated by anything in the context. The explanation of the words must rather be sought in the nature of our Lord, or in some attribute of that nature. There are a few passages, mainly in the Epistles of St. Paul, in which language somewhat similar is employed in regard to the spirit (<span class= "ital">pneuma</span>) of our Lord. The most remarkable of these are <a href="/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>, where "spirit of holiness" is placed in contrast with "flesh;" and <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>, "in spirit." On the latter Bishop Ellicott writes: "<span class= "ital">in spirit</span>, in the higher sphere of His divine life: the <span class= "ital">pneuma</span> of Christ is not here the Holy Spirit, but <span class= "ital">the higher principle of</span> spiritual life, which was not the Divinity (this would be an Apollinarian assertion), but especially and intimately united with it." (Another passage of great interest is <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>.) The attribute "eternal" is explained by <a href="/context/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.">Hebrews 7:18-19</a>, "according to power of indissoluble life (He hath become priest), for of Him it is testified, Thou art a priest for ever." Through this spirit, a spirit of holiness, a spirit of indissoluble life, He offered Himself to God. This made such a self-offering possible; this gave to the offering infinite worth. In the words which stand in contrast with these (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a>) we read of the death of animals which had no power over their own transient life: He who was typified in every high priest and in every victim, "through an eternal spirit," of Himself laid down His life (<a href="/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
