The struggle against sin is a common theme throughout the New Testament, emphasizing the need for perseverance and vigilance (<a href="/romans/7-21.htm">Romans 7:21-25</a>). The imagery of a struggle suggests an active, ongoing effort, akin to an athletic contest or military battle, which was a familiar concept in the Greco-Roman world. This struggle is not only personal but also communal, as the early church faced external pressures and internal temptations.<p><b>you have not yet resisted</b><br>The word "resisted" implies a defensive stance, suggesting that believers are called to stand firm against sin. This resistance is not passive but involves active opposition, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, where believers are urged to put on the full armor of God. The use of "not yet" indicates that the struggle is ongoing and that there is potential for greater resistance. This phrase encourages believers to continue in their efforts, drawing strength from the example of Christ and other faithful witnesses.<p><b>to the point of shedding your blood</b><br>This phrase highlights the ultimate sacrifice of martyrdom, which some early Christians faced. It serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the example of Jesus, who shed His blood for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>). The mention of bloodshed connects to the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where blood was required for atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). It also points to the persecution faced by early Christians, as seen in the martyrdom of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54-60</a>) and James (<a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12:1-2</a>). This phrase challenges believers to consider the depth of their commitment and willingness to suffer for their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience_of_hebrews.htm">The Audience of Hebrews</a></b><br>The letter is addressed to Jewish Christians who were facing persecution and were tempted to revert to Judaism to avoid suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The ultimate example of resisting sin and enduring suffering, having shed His blood for humanity's redemption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_christian_community.htm">The Early Christian Community</a></b><br>They faced various trials and persecutions, serving as a backdrop for the exhortation in this passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The adversary against which believers are called to struggle, representing both personal sin and external temptations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution.htm">Persecution</a></b><br>The context of suffering and trials that the original audience was experiencing, which is a key theme in the book of Hebrews.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_struggle.htm">Understanding the Struggle</a></b><br>Recognize that the Christian life involves a continuous struggle against sin, requiring vigilance and perseverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Be prepared to endure suffering for the sake of righteousness, following the example of Christ who resisted sin to the point of shedding His blood.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_resilience.htm">Spiritual Resilience</a></b><br>Develop spiritual resilience by relying on God's strength and the example of Jesus, who endured the cross.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_support.htm">Community Support</a></b><br>Engage with the Christian community for encouragement and support in the struggle against sin and persecution.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Maintain an eternal perspective, understanding that present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory to be revealed.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_12_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 12:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Heb_12_4_inspire_resisting_sin.htm">How does Hebrews 12:4 encourage perseverance in resisting sin in our lives?

The verse anchors us in the certainty that Scripture is both true and practical: victory over sin is attainable, perseverance is essential, and God supplies all we need to stand firm until the end.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Ye have not yet resisted unto blood.</span>--Still the general figure is retained, but for the footrace is substituted the contest of the pugilists.

(See Note.) The contest has been maintained but feebly, for no blood has flowed in their struggle with temptation and sin; they have not deserted the arena, but have shrunk from the suffering which a determined struggle would have caused.
