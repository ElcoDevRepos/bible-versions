In the biblical context, discipline is not merely punitive but is intended for growth and maturity. The concept of enduring suffering is prevalent throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, where trials are said to produce perseverance and maturity. The Greek word for "endure" (hypomen&#333;) implies a steadfastness and patience under trial, suggesting that believers are to remain faithful and trust in God's purpose through their difficulties.<p><b>God is treating you as sons.</b><br>This phrase highlights the intimate relationship between God and believers, likening it to that of a father and his children. In the cultural context of the time, sonship implied inheritance, identity, and belonging. <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a> further elaborates on this concept, where believers are described as having received the Spirit of adoption, making them heirs with Christ. The idea of God treating believers as sons underscores His love and commitment to their spiritual growth and well-being, much like a father who disciplines his children for their benefit.<p><b>For what son is not disciplined by his father?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the normalcy and necessity of discipline in a familial relationship. In the historical and cultural context of the ancient Near East, discipline was an expected part of child-rearing, aimed at teaching and guiding children. <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a> supports this notion, stating that a father who loves his son is diligent in disciplining him. This analogy serves to reassure believers that divine discipline is a sign of God's love and care, not of His displeasure or rejection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate Father who disciplines His children out of love and for their growth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons/children_of_god.htm">Sons/Children of God</a></b><br>Believers who are being disciplined by God, indicating their status as His children.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/earthly_fathers.htm">Earthly Fathers</a></b><br>Used as an analogy to explain the concept of divine discipline.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrews.htm">Hebrews</a></b><br>The original audience of the letter, likely Jewish Christians familiar with Old Testament teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/discipline.htm">Discipline</a></b><br>The process of training and correction that believers undergo, likened to the discipline a father gives to his son.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_discipline_as_love.htm">Understanding Discipline as Love</a></b><br>Recognize that God's discipline is a sign of His love and our status as His children.

(2) "Endure for chastening:" bear the trial, instead of seeking to avoid it by unworthy and dangerous concession; endure it, that it may effect its merciful purpose.<p><span class= "bld">What son is he.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">what son is there whom his</span> father chasteneth <span class= "ital">not?</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For chastening ye endure</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">It is for chastening that ye endure.</span> The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, supported by almost the whole weight of manuscripts (including all the uncials that contain the text), of ancient versions, and commentators (Theophylact being the only certain exception), is decidedly to be accepted instead of the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (equivalent to "if ye endure chastening") of the Textus Receptus. Moreover, it is required for the sense of the passage in regard to the proper meaning of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("endure"), which is to "submit to," or "endure patiently," not simply "to undergo." For to say, "if ye endure chastisement patiently, God dealeth with you as sons," has no meaning; our being treated as sons depends, not on the way we take our chastisement, but on our being chastised at all. The use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> to express purpose is common in this Epistle (cf. <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: 3:5, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: 4:16, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: 6:16, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>): and the essential sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is discipline or education. The drift is the same, whether we take <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> as an indicative or an imperative. Thus the next clause of the verse follows suitably: <span class="cmt_word">God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there</span> (or, <span class="accented">who is a son</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whom his father chasteneth not?
