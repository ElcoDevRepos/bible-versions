The mountain was covered with smoke, there was thunder and lightning, and the sound of a trumpet, which created a fearsome and awe-inspiring scene (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). This event emphasized the holiness and power of God, instilling a sense of reverence and fear among the people. The terrifying nature of the sight underscores the seriousness of God's covenant and the need for obedience.<p><b>that even Moses said,</b><br>Moses, as the leader and mediator between God and the Israelites, was a figure of great faith and courage. His reaction to the sight is significant because it highlights the overwhelming nature of God's presence. Moses had previously encountered God in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1-6</a>) and had witnessed numerous miracles, yet even he was deeply affected by the manifestation of God's glory at Sinai. This emphasizes the gravity of the situation and the divine authority of the Law being given.<p><b>&#8220;I am trembling with fear.&#8221;</b><br>This quote attributed to Moses is not directly found in the Old Testament account of Sinai but is understood to convey the intense fear and reverence he felt. It reflects the human response to the divine majesty and holiness of God. The fear Moses experienced is a reminder of the proper attitude one should have towards God&#8212;one of awe and respect. This trembling can be seen as a type of the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). It also points to the need for a mediator between God and humanity, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who provides a new covenant based on grace rather than fear (<a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
