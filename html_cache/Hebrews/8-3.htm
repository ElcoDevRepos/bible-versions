The high priest was appointed to serve as a mediator between God and the people, performing sacred duties in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple. This appointment was not a matter of personal ambition but a divine calling, as seen in the selection of Aaron and his descendants (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). The high priest's role was crucial in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>to offer both gifts and sacrifices,</b><br>The high priest's duties included offering gifts and sacrifices, which were central to the worship and atonement practices in Israel. Gifts often referred to offerings of gratitude or devotion, such as grain offerings, while sacrifices typically involved the shedding of blood for atonement, as outlined in Leviticus. These offerings were a foreshadowing of the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who fulfilled and surpassed the Old Testament sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>).<p><b>it was necessary for this One also to have something to offer.</b><br>This phrase highlights the necessity of Christ's offering, drawing a parallel between the high priest's duties and Jesus' role as the ultimate High Priest. Unlike the Levitical priests, who offered repeated sacrifices, Jesus offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>). His sacrifice was not only necessary but sufficient, fulfilling the requirements of the Law and establishing a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>). This offering was prophesied in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant is depicted as a sacrificial offering for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>In the context of Hebrews, the high priest is a key figure in the Jewish religious system, responsible for offering sacrifices to God on behalf of the people.

He has been shown to be a High Priest: therefore he must make some offering, this being the very purpose of a high priest's office (cf. <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>). But where? Not certainly in the earthly tabernacle, this being served already, and exclusively served, by the sons of Aaron. Therefore it must be in the heavenly sphere symbolized by the earthly tabernacle. And then, in ver. 5, that there <span class="accented">is</span> a heavenly reality, of which the earthly tabernacle is but a shadow, is shown by what was said of the latter when it was made. (What Christ offers in the heavenly sphere is surely his own atoning sacrifice. Some commentators have found a difficulty in this conception on the ground that this his sacrifice had been completed once for all before his ascension. True; but he is regarded as carrying its efficacy with him to the mercy-seat above, and so for ever offering it; even as it is continually commemorated and pleaded in the Eucharist by the Church below. And thus, be it observed, the symbolism of the Day of Atonement is accurately fulfilled. For the high priest did not sacrifice within the tabernacle; he only carried to the holy of holies the blood, representing the atoning efficacy of the sacrifice made outside before his entrance.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/8-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And since</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
