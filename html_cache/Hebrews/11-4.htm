The phrase "by faith" indicates that Abel's sacrifice was made with a heart of trust and obedience to God, contrasting with Cain's offering, which lacked these qualities. Abel's sacrifice was a blood offering, which aligns with the later sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The distinction between Abel's and Cain's offerings highlights the importance of the heart's condition in worship, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. Abel's faith is a precursor to the faith required for salvation, as emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>By faith he was commended as righteous when God gave approval to his gifts.</b><br>Abel's righteousness is attributed to his faith, not merely the act of sacrifice itself. This aligns with the doctrine of justification by faith, as later expounded by Paul in <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>, where Abraham's faith is credited as righteousness. God's approval of Abel's gifts signifies divine acceptance, which is a theme throughout Scripture, where God desires obedience and faith over mere ritual (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>). Abel's commendation as righteous prefigures the righteousness imputed to believers through faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>.<p><b>And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.</b><br>Abel's faith continues to testify to future generations, illustrating the enduring impact of a life lived in faith. This echoes the concept of a "cloud of witnesses" in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, where the faithful lives of past believers encourage and instruct current believers. Abel's story is a reminder of the eternal significance of faith, as his example transcends his earthly life. His blood, crying out from the ground (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>), symbolizes the voice of justice and righteousness, contrasting with the blood of Christ, which speaks a better word (<a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>), offering forgiveness and reconciliation.

Abel&#8217;s gift flowed from trust in God&#8217;s revealed way&#8212;blood sacrifice prefiguring the Lamb to come (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>; <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith always treasures what God says above personal preference. Cain ignored divine instruction and relied on his own idea of worship, a pattern echoed in <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a> and <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>.<p>&#8226; The writer of Hebrews places Abel first in the &#8220;faith chapter&#8221; to remind us that acceptable worship begins with believing hearts rather than impressive works (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By faith he was commended as righteous when God gave approval to his gifts</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a> states, &#8220;The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,&#8221; establishing that God Himself pronounced the verdict. <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a> echoes that heavenly commendation.<p>&#8226; Faith is the channel through which righteousness is credited (<a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3-5</a>). Abel&#8217;s standing before God did not rest on the sacrifice alone but on the believing heart behind it.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s approval separates the two brothers. Cain&#8217;s anger reveals a heart still unmoved by faith, leading to sin&#8217;s mastery over him (<a href="/genesis/4-6.htm">Genesis 4:6-7</a>). Abel, however, enjoyed divine affirmation long before law or ritual&#8212;proof that salvation has always been by grace through faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead</b><p>&#8226; Though murdered (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>), Abel&#8217;s testimony lives on.

Abel&#8217;s blood cries for justice; Christ&#8217;s blood declares forgiveness.<p>&#8226; Faith produces a legacy that outlasts earthly life. Like Abel, believers can expect their obedient trust to impact others long after they are with the Lord (<a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This verse underscores the permanence of God&#8217;s verdicts: what He commends endures, untouched by death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a> presents Abel as the first model of genuine faith: trusting God&#8217;s revealed will, offering worship that pleases Him, receiving divine approval, and leaving an enduring witness. True faith listens to God&#8217;s word, responds with wholehearted obedience, is declared righteous by God Himself, and continues to influence others beyond the grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">A more excellent.</span>--The Greek literally means that Abel's sacrifice was "more than" Cain's (comp. <a href="/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.">Hebrews 3:3</a>, "more glory"; <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?">Matthew 6:25</a>; <a href="/luke/11-32.htm" title="The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.">Luke 11:32</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The word "sacrifice" (which, as is the case with very many words in this chapter, is taken directly from the LXX.) has not its special sense (see Note on <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>) in the narrative of Genesis 4; for the offerings of the two brothers are there designated by the same name, both in the Hebrew ("offering") and in the Greek ("sacrifice"). Hence, apart from the first words, "by faith," there is nothing here said to explain the superiority of Abel's offering; though one who believes sacrifice to have been of Divine institution, and who notes the close connection between God's word and the actions of the men whose faith is here recorded, may hold it probable that Abel's obedience was manifested in his mode of approaching God.<p><span class= "bld">By which he obtained witness.</span>--Probably, "through which <span class= "ital">faith," </span>but the Greek may also mean <span class= "ital">through which sacrifice.</span> The witness (<a href="/hebrews/11-2.htm" title="For by it the elders obtained a good report.">Hebrews 11:2</a>) is that borne by God in His acceptance of the offering (shown by some visible sign); we might also add that such a testimony to Abel is implied in the reproof of Cain (<a href="/genesis/4-7.htm" title="If you do well, shall you not be accepted? and if you do not well, sin lies at the door. And to you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him.">Genesis 4:7</a>), but the following words, "God bearing witness over" (or <span class= "ital">in regard to</span>)<span class= "ital"> "</span>his gifts," show what was chiefly in the writer's thought. Such acceptance implied Abel's righteousness and thus testified to his "faith." It is remarkable that in three out of the four places in which Abel is mentioned in the New Testament this epithet is used (<a href="/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.

In the later Jewish tradition (contained in the Targum of Jerusalem) the brothers are represented as types of faith and unbelief; and in <a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm" title="For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.">Hebrews 11:10</a>, "thy brother's blood" (Hebrew, "bloods") is expanded into "the blood of the multitude of the righteous who were to arise from thy brother." In this clause the authorities for the Greek text are much divided. One reading, "he testifying over his gifts to God," has the support of the three oldest MSS., but can hardly be correct. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. faith</span>, not <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, "faith" being the ruling idea of the whole passage) <span class="cmt_word">he obtained witness</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was witnessed of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that he was righteous, God testifying of</span> (literally, <span class="accented">witnessing upon</span>, or, <span class="accented">in respect to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his gifts: and through it</span> (<span class="accented">faith<span class="cmt_word"></span>) he being dead yet speaketh.</span> In the traditions preserved in Genesis of the dim and distant antediluvian period, three figures stand out prominently as representing the righteous seed in the midst of growing evil - Abel, Enoch, and Noah. These are, therefore, first adduced with the view of showing that it is in respect of faith that they are thus distinguished in the sacred record. With respect to Abel, it is not necessary to inquire or conjecture whether the bloody character of his offering is to be considered as constituting its superior excellence. The record in Genesis simply represents the two brothers as offering each what he had to offer in accordance with his occupation and pursuits, the only difference being that Abel is said to, have offered <span class="accented">his firstlings</span> and the fat thereof, while nothing is said of Cain having brought his first fruits or his best. Then, in the account of the result, we are only told that unto one the LORD had respect, and not to the other, without mention of the reason why. It is usual to find a reason in the nature of Abel's offering as signifying atonement, and to suppose his faith manifested in his recognition of the need of such atonement, signified to him, as has been further supposed, by Divine command. This view of the intention of the narrative is indeed suggested by the description of what his offering was, viewed in the light of subsequent sacrificial theory; but it is not apparent in the narrative taken by itself, or in the reference to it in the passage before us. The acceptableness of the offering is here simply attributed, as of necessity, to the faith of the offerer, without any intimation of how that faith had been evinced. And with this view of the matter agrees the record itself, where it is said that "unto Abel and his offering the LORD had respect;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Abel first, and then to his offering - the offering was accepted because Abel was, not Abel on account of his kind of offering. "Crone quod datur Deo ex dantis mente pensatur... Neque enim sacrum eloquimn dicit, Respexit ad munera Abel et ad Cain mqnera non respexit, sed prius air quid respexit ad Abel, ac deinde subjunxit, 'et ad munera ejus.' Idcirco non Abel ex muneribus, sed ex Abel munera oblata placuerunt" (St. Gregory, quoted by Delitzsch). "And he being dead," etc., refers plainly to <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground." The same voice of innocent blood, which appealed at the beginning of human history to the God of righteousness, cries still through all the ages; it sounds in our own cars now, telling us that faith prevails on high, and that "right dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints." Cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a> for an allusion again to the cry of the blood of Abel.
