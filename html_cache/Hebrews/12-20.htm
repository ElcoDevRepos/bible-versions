The people were overwhelmed by the holiness and majesty of God, which was manifested through thunder, lightning, and a thick cloud on the mountain. The command was part of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing the seriousness of approaching a holy God. The inability to bear the command highlights human frailty and the need for a mediator, which in the New Testament is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>&#8220;If even an animal touches the mountain,</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the absolute holiness of God and the sanctity of the mountain during His presence. The command that even an animal must not touch the mountain without consequence illustrates the separation between the divine and the profane. This separation is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God's holiness is often depicted as unapproachable without proper mediation or sacrifice.<p><b>it must be stoned.&#8221;</b><br>The method of stoning as a punishment reflects the seriousness of violating God's command. Stoning was a common form of capital punishment in ancient Israel, used for various offenses that warranted the community's involvement in upholding the law. This command served as a deterrent and a reminder of the consequences of disobedience. In a broader theological context, it points to the need for a new covenant, where Jesus' sacrifice bridges the gap between God and humanity, allowing believers to approach God with confidence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave the Law to Moses.
