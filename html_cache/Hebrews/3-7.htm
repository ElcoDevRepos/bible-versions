The use of "Therefore" connects the preceding discussion about the superiority of Christ to Moses and the faithfulness required of believers. The mention of the Holy Spirit as the speaker emphasizes the divine inspiration of Scripture, affirming that the words of the Old Testament are not merely historical but are living and active, relevant for the audience of Hebrews and for believers today. This underscores the continuity and unity of the Bible, where the Holy Spirit is seen as the ultimate author of Scripture, guiding the writers to convey God's message.<p><b>&#8220;Today, if you hear His voice,</b><br>The word "Today" signifies urgency and immediacy, calling the audience to respond in the present moment. It reflects the idea that God's call is always current and requires a timely response. This echoes the daily nature of faith and obedience, as seen in the Israelites' journey in the wilderness, where they were called to trust God daily for provision and guidance. The phrase "if you hear His voice" implies the necessity of being attentive and receptive to God's communication. It suggests that God is continually speaking to His people, and it is their responsibility to listen and respond. This connects to the broader biblical theme of hearing and obeying God's word, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a> and <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>.

With the words introducing the quotation compare <a href="/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-15.htm" title="Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,">Hebrews 10:15</a>.<p>Whether the marks of parenthesis here introduced in our ordinary Bibles (not inserted by the translators of 1611) express the true connection of the verses is a question very hard to decide, and one that does not admit of full discussion here. It is very possible that the writer (like St. Paul in <a href="/romans/15-3.htm" title="For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell on me.">Romans 15:3</a>; <a href="/romans/15-21.htm" title="But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.">Romans 15:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm" title="That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.">1Corinthians 1:31</a>) may have merged his own exhortation in that which the quotation supplies (<a href="/hebrews/3-8.htm" title="Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:">Hebrews 3:8</a>); and the objection that <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a> would naturally in that case have been introduced by some connective word is shown to be groundless by such passages as <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm" title="Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)">Hebrews 10:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-7.htm" title="If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?">Hebrews 12:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm" title="See that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven:">Hebrews 12:25</a>. On the other hand, if we connect "Wherefore," in this verse, with "Take heed" in <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a>, we have greater regularity of structure--a strong argument in this Epistle. It seems unlikely, moreover, that the writer (whose tenderness of tone and sympathy are so manifest in his words of warning) would at this stage adopt as his own the stringent and general exhortation, "harden not your hearts:" the spirit of <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a> ("lest <span class= "ital">haply</span> there <span class= "ital">shall be</span> in <span class= "ital">any one</span> of you") is altogether different. On the whole, therefore, it seems best to consider <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm" title="Why (as the Holy Ghost said, To day if you will hear his voice,">Hebrews 3:7</a> ("To-day . . .") to <a href="/hebrews/3-11.htm" title="So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)">Hebrews 3:11</a> (". . . my rest") as a pure quotation, enforcing the warning that follows. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts</span>. The warning, thus led up to, is now introduced by a long quotation from <a href="/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>, which is cited at length, because the writer is about to dwell on its whole significance in the remainder of this and also in the succeeding chapter. The warning is connected by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> with the conclusion of ver. 6. <span class="accented">Since</span> our continuing to be God's house is on the condition of our steadfastness, <span class="accented">therefore</span> beware of failing, as the Israelites referred to by the psalmist did. With regard to the construction of the passage, there is some difficulty in discovering the apodosis to the initiatory <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> ("<span class="accented">as</span> saith the Holy Ghost"). It seems best to suppose one understood, being suggested by "harden not your hearts," which occurs m the midst of the quotation. Sentences thus grammatically incomplete are in the style of St. Paul. Otherwise the apodosis must be found in <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (ver. 12), the long intervening passage being parenthetical. It is, after all, only a question of grammatical construction; in any case the general meaning is clear. As to the successive clauses of the quotation from <a href="/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>. (vers. 7-11), it is to be observed that <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "If ye will hear his voice" may probably mean in the Hebrew, "Oh that ye would hear his voice!" But the Greek of the LXX., cited in the Epistle, is capable of the same meaning. Here, again, the meaning of the particular phrase does not affect the drift of the passage. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Harden not your hearts" expresses the abjuration which ensues from resistance of grace. Elsewhere such judicial hardening is attributed to God; as when he is said to have hardened Pharaoh's heart (cf. <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>, etc.; <a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13</a>). The two modes of expression involve no difference of doctrine. It is God's doing as being judicial; man's as being due to his own perversity. As in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness. Here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, which is from the LXX., may mean "<span class="accented">at</span> the time <span class="accented">of"</span> (cf. <a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), or "according to," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "after the manner of." The former agrees best with the Hebrew psalm, which has "As at Meribah, as on the day of Massah in the wilderness," referring to the two places called by these names from what occurred there, when the people murmured for want of water. The first occurrence was at Rephidim, in the wilderness of Sin, at the commencement of the wandering (<a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-8</a>); the second was in the wilderness of Zin, near Kadesh, towards the end of the forty years (<a href="/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-14</a>). Both names are assigned to the former place in <a href="/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>; but elsewhere they are distinguished (see <a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>). In the text, following the LXX., equivalents of the Hebrew names are given, Massah being rendered literally by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: Meribah (equivalent to "strife ") by the unusual word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs only here and in the psalm, though the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is common in the LXX. The root of the word being <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> ("bitter"), it may possibly have been suggested by the occurrence at Marah (equivalent to "bitterness"), where there was also a murmuring about water (<a href="/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23</a>), <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> being the LXX. equivalent of Marah. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> When (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, as is common in the LXX. and New Testament) your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. In place of the reading of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> ("proved me"), which agrees with the LXX., the authority of manuscripts is in favor of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>. This again, like the ether variations of reading, is of no importance with regard to the meaning. But further, in the original Hebrew, and apparently in the LXX., "forty years" is connected with the clause that follows: "forty years long was I grieved," etc.; whereas, in the text, the interposition of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> at the beginning of ver. 10, necessitates its connection with "saw my works." It is possible that the writer of the Epistle intended a reference to the corresponding forty years from the manifestation of Christ to the destruction of Jerusalem, which were drawing to their close at the time of writing, and during which the Israelites of his day were trying God by their rejection of the gospel, or, in the case of some of the believers addressed, by their wavering allegiance to it. The supposition that this idea was in the writer's mind is supported by the fact that Jewish writers refer to the psalm as assigning forty years for <span class="accented">the days of the Messiah</span> (see reference in Bleek, Delitzsch, Alford, etc.). That the writer had an intention in his variation from the original is the more likely from his following it correctly afterwards in ver. 17.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#972;</span> <span class="translit">(Dio)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1352.htm">Strong's 1352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wherefore, on which account, therefore.
