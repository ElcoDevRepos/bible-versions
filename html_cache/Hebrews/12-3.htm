The hostility Jesus endured is documented throughout the Gospels, particularly in the events leading up to His crucifixion. This includes the Pharisees' and Sadducees' plots against Him, the betrayal by Judas, and the false accusations during His trial. The term "sinners" here refers to those who were opposed to God's purposes, highlighting the spiritual battle Jesus faced. This reflection serves as an encouragement to believers to remain steadfast in their faith, drawing strength from Christ's example.<p><b>so that you will not grow weary and lose heart</b><br>The purpose of considering Christ's endurance is to prevent believers from becoming discouraged in their own spiritual journey. The early Christian community, to whom the Book of Hebrews was addressed, faced persecution and trials, which could lead to spiritual fatigue and discouragement. The exhortation is to maintain perseverance, drawing a parallel to the endurance required in a race, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>. This encouragement is consistent with other New Testament teachings, such as <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, which urges believers not to grow weary in doing good.

The change of "Himself" into "themselves" (the reading of the oldest MSS.) is important, but it is not easy to say with what the last two words should be joined; for the meaning may be either "sinners against themselves" (comp. <a href="/numbers/16-38.htm" title="The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.">Numbers 16:38</a>), or "gainsaying against themselves," In either case the force of the words will be that the sin or the opposition manifested against Him was really against themselves, since it was for their salvation that He came upon earth.
