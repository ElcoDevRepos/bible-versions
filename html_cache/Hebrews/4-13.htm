The idea that nothing is hidden from God is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where David acknowledges that God knows his every thought and action. This understanding of God's all-seeing nature serves as both a comfort and a warning, reminding believers of God's intimate knowledge of their lives. Historically, this concept would have been particularly poignant for early Christians facing persecution, as it reassured them that God was aware of their struggles and faithfulness.<p><b>everything is uncovered and exposed before the eyes of Him</b><br>The imagery of being "uncovered and exposed" suggests a complete vulnerability before God. This can be likened to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where offerings were laid bare before God as a sign of repentance and devotion. The Greek word used here for "exposed" can also imply being laid bare or naked, which in the cultural context of the time, indicated total transparency and honesty. This phrase underscores the idea that God sees beyond outward appearances and into the true nature of the heart, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.<p><b>to whom we must give account.</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine judgment and accountability. The notion of giving an account is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, such as in the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants are called to account for their stewardship. It reflects the belief that all individuals will stand before God to answer for their lives, a theme also found in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>. This accountability is not just for actions but also for thoughts and intentions, reinforcing the call to live a life of integrity and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The omniscient Creator who sees all things.

It is usually applied to a wrestler who by dragging back the neck overthrows his adversary: and "prostrate" has been suggested as the meaning here. Another explanation refers the word to the drawing back of a criminal's head, so as to expose his face to public gaze; but, though we read of such a custom in Latin authors, we have no proof that the Greek word was used in this sense. There seems no good reason for supposing any allusion to a sacrificial victim with head thrown back (slain, or ready to be slain).<p><span class= "bld">Unto the eyes of him . . .</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">unto His eyes: with Whom</span> (or, <span class= "ital">and with Him</span>)<span class= "ital"> we have to do.</span> The last solemn words recall the connection of the whole passage.

Heb 5:1 to Heb 10:18. Following the example of Luther, Tyndale and Coverdale begin the fifth chapter here; but the connection of the three verses with what precedes is too close to justify this.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and laid open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do</span>. The main difficulty in this verse is as to the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (translated "<span class="accented">laid</span> open"). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> (which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament or LXX., but is, with its compound <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, not uncommon in Philo and Josephus) has in classical Greek the sense of "seizing by the throat," or "bending back the neck," as in wrestling. And this, with the further idea of "overthrowing" or "laying prostrate," is the prevailing sense in Philo, from whom Wetstein quotes many passages in illustration. Taking, then, with most modern commentators, the sense of bending back the neck as the primary one, we have only to consider what secondary meaning is here to be attached to it. Some take the idea to be that of being thrown on the ground supine, so as to be thoroughly exposed to view. So Bengel: "<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">resupino</span>, Graece et Latine dicitur pro patefacio. Corpora quae prona jacent vix nuda censentur; nam se ipsa tegunt: <span class="accented">resupinata</span>, secundum partes nobilissimas quasque et distinctissimas visui patent." Many (Eisner, Wolf, Baumgarten, Kuinoel, Bretschneider, Block, De Wette, etc., following Perizonius, on AElian, 'Vat. Hist.,' 12:58) see an allusion to the Roman custom of exposing criminals "<span class="accented">reducto</span> capite," "<span class="accented">retortis cervieibus</span>," so that all might see their faces (see Suetonius, <span class="accented">Vitel.,'</span> 17; Pliny, 'Panegyr.,' 34. 3). There is, however, no other known instance of the Greek verb being used with this reference, which there seems to be no necessity for assuming. The idea may be simply the general one thus expressed by Delitzsch, "that whatever shamefaced creature bows its head, and would fain withdraw and cloak itself from the eyes of God, has indeed the throat, as it were, bent back before those eyes, with no possibility of escape, exposed and naked to their view." Many of the ancients (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Ecumenius, Theophylact) saw in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> a reference to the treatment of sacrificial victims, as being smitten on the neck or hung by the neck for the purpose of being flayed from the neck downwards, or cut open thence, so as to expose the entrails to view. But no instance is known of such use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, the idea of which may have been suggested to commentators by the figure of the sword in the verse preceding; which figure, however, there is no reason to suppose continued in ver. 13, the idea of which is simply complete exposure, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>. The ancients take the concluding expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as meaning "<span class="accented">to</span> whom our account must be given," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">to</span> whom we are responsible as our judge" - in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The A.V. seems better to give the general idea of relation by the apt phrase, "<span class="accented">with</span> whom we have to do." Of course, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> here has no reference to the Word of God, the recurrence of the word, in a subordinate sense, being merely accidental. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Nothing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ouk)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
