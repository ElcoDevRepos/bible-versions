It sets the stage for understanding that faith is the foundation for the commendation of the ancients. This concept of faith is central to the entire chapter, which is often referred to as the "Faith Hall of Fame."<p><b>the ancients</b><br>The "ancients" refers to the Old Testament figures who lived by faith. These include Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and others mentioned later in the chapter. These individuals are examples of living by faith before the coming of Christ. Their lives are documented in the Hebrew Scriptures, providing a historical and spiritual lineage for the early Christian audience, who would have been familiar with these stories.<p><b>were commended</b><br>The ancients were "commended" for their faith, meaning they received approval or praise from God. This commendation is not based on their works or adherence to the law but on their faith, which aligns with the broader biblical theme that righteousness comes through faith. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>, where Abraham's faith is credited to him as righteousness. The commendation of the ancients serves as a testament to the enduring nature of faith and its importance in the relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders.htm">The Elders</a></b><br>Refers to the patriarchs and matriarchs of the faith, such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and others mentioned in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.
