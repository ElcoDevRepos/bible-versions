Enoch, the seventh from Adam, lived in a time of increasing wickedness, yet he walked faithfully with God (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>). His being "taken up" prefigures the concept of the rapture, where believers are caught up to meet the Lord (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>). Enoch's faith is a testament to the possibility of living a life pleasing to God amidst a corrupt world.<p><b>&#8220;He could not be found, because God had taken him away.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the mysterious and divine nature of Enoch's departure. Unlike Elijah, who was taken up in a whirlwind (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), Enoch's translation was without witnesses, underscoring the personal relationship he had with God. The phrase "could not be found" suggests a search, indicating that his disappearance was noticed and significant. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of believers from death through Christ's resurrection and the promise of eternal life (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).<p><b>For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.</b><br>Enoch's life was marked by a testimony of pleasing God, which is the essence of faith (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). His commendation is not based on works but on his relationship with God, reflecting the principle that faith is credited as righteousness (<a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>). Enoch's life serves as a type of Christ, who perfectly pleased the Father (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). This commendation also points to the reward of faith, as those who earnestly seek God will find Him and be rewarded (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/enoch.htm">Enoch</a></b><br>A patriarch from the seventh generation after Adam, known for his close walk with God and his unique departure from this world without experiencing death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who took Enoch away, demonstrating His power over life and death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_enoch's_translation.htm">The Event of Enoch's Translation</a></b><br>Enoch's being taken up by God is a significant event that underscores the power of faith and God's approval of a life that pleases Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_faith.htm">The Power of Faith</a></b><br>Enoch's life exemplifies the transformative power of faith.
