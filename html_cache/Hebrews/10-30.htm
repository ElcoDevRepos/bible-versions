The knowledge of God is rooted in the Old Testament, where His character and promises are consistently displayed. This assurance is foundational for understanding His justice and faithfulness.<p><b>&#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,&#8221;</b><br>This is a direct quotation from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, where God declares His sovereign right to execute justice. It underscores the principle that vengeance belongs to God alone, not to humans. This reflects God's perfect justice and omniscience, ensuring that retribution is carried out righteously. It also serves as a warning against taking personal revenge, aligning with teachings in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>.<p><b>and again,</b><br>The repetition here indicates the importance and certainty of the message. It serves to reinforce the seriousness of God's role as judge and His commitment to justice.<p><b>&#8220;The Lord will judge His people.&#8221;</b><br>This is a reference to <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>, highlighting God's role as the ultimate judge of His covenant people. It serves as both a warning and a comfort: a warning to those who are unfaithful and a comfort to those who are oppressed, knowing that God will vindicate them. This judgment is not only punitive but also corrective, aiming to bring His people back to righteousness. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God's judgment, seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>, where judgment begins with the household of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

Scripture establishes truth &#8220;by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).

For Him, the way into the Holiest led through the veil, His flesh. As the veil concealed from the high priest the place of God's presence, which he could enter only by passing through the veil; so, although in His earthly life Jesus dwelt in the presence of God, yet as our representative He could not enter the heavenly sanctuary until He had passed through and out of His life of flesh (see <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>). There is probably a covert allusion to the rending of the Temple veil in the hour when Jesus thus passed through the rent veil of His flesh. This way is new (<a href="/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>), it is living, for in truth this "way" is living union with Christ (<a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>).<p>(30) <span class= "bld">Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense.</span>--This quotation from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm" title="To me belongs vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> completely preserves the sense of the original words, "To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence," whilst departing from their form. The LXX. shows still wider divergence, neglecting entirely the emphasis which rests on the words "to <span class= "ital">Me"</span> It is therefore very remarkable that this quotation is given, in exactly the same form, in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>. As, however, the words "I will recompense" are found in the most ancient of the Targums (that of Onkelos) it is very possible that St. Paul may have there adopted a form already current amongst the Jews. (See Note on <a href="/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>.) If so, there is no difficulty in accounting for the coincidence in this place. But, even if this supposition is. without foundation, and the saying in this form was first used in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>, is there any real cause for wonder if a disciple of St. Paul in a single instance reproduces the Apostle's words?
