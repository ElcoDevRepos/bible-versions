In the cultural context of the early church, milk was a common symbol for elementary instruction, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>. The audience of Hebrews, likely Jewish Christians, would understand this imagery as a call to move beyond the foundational teachings of Judaism and early Christian doctrine to deeper spiritual maturity.<p><b>is still an infant</b><br>The term "infant" signifies spiritual immaturity. In the Greco-Roman world, infancy was associated with a lack of understanding and experience. This metaphor highlights the need for growth in faith and knowledge, urging believers to progress beyond the initial stages of their spiritual journey. The writer of Hebrews is encouraging the audience to mature in their faith, similar to how Paul addresses the Corinthians about their spiritual infancy.<p><b>inexperienced in the message of righteousness</b><br>The "message of righteousness" refers to the deeper truths of the Christian faith, including the understanding of Christ's priesthood and the believer's sanctification. In the Jewish tradition, righteousness was closely tied to adherence to the Law. However, the New Testament redefines righteousness through faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. The audience is being challenged to deepen their comprehension of this new covenant righteousness, moving from a basic understanding to a more profound grasp of their identity and calling in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/author_of_hebrews.htm">Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

The call is to grow&#8212;moving from basic truths to deeper doctrine and obedient living&#8212;so that our senses are trained, our discernment sharpened, and our lives increasingly reflect Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) The change of expression from <span class= "ital">having need of milk</span> to <span class= "ital">partaking of milk</span> (that is, making it the <span class= "ital">solo</span> food) is significant. Those who are addressed had lost interest in the deeper truths of Christianity, those truths which alone expressed and explained its proper nature. Their temptation apparently was towards mingling a rudimentary Christian doctrine with the teaching of the synagogue. Yielding to this they would lose all real Knowledge of the very elements of Christian truth, and with this all true knowledge of the Old Testament itself. The connection between this verse and the last may probably be, <span class= "ital">Ye have come to need milk, for</span>--<span class= "ital">making it by choice your sole food</span>--<span class= "ital">ye stand self-confessed as babes.</span><p><span class= "bld">Unskilful.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">without experience.</span> The "word of righteousness" evidently must signify complete, properly-developed Christian teaching. The only question is, Why is this particular designation chosen? In the Epistle to the Romans such a description would be natural (see especially <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="/romans/9-31.htm" title="But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.">Romans 9:31</a>); but "righteousness" is not the direct and manifest subject of this Epistle. Still, the expressions of which the writer makes use in <a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm" title="Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.">Hebrews 10:38</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm" title="By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.">Hebrews 11:7</a>, together with the general similarity between his teaching and St. Paul's, go very far towards explaining his choice of this special expression as descriptive of the religion of Christ. In like manner another phrase, "law of liberty," is characteristic of St. James.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For every one that partaketh of milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</span> Reason for saying that they are such as have need of <span class="accented">milk</span>; <span class="accented">for</span> milk is the nourishment of infants, and he that is an infant in respect of spiritual growth is <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: not of necessity unacquainted with it altogether, but still not versed in it; he is but a tyro. "Word of righteousness" may be taken as a general term to denote what we might call religious lore; referring here especially to the gospel, which is eminently the revelation of the "righteousness of God" (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-9.htm">2 Corinthians 3:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: and 2 Cor 11:15, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>); but not excluding a more general conception. There is no need to suppose an exclusive reference to the more perfect doctrine in opposition to the elements, since, of the whole subject of religious knowledge, the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may be said to be <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of being without the matured skill that experience gives. Hence, too, we are certainly not justified in finding in the phrase a specific allusion to the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith only, which is not suggested by the context or by what follows. Still less may we (with Delitzsch) so ignore the notable significance of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as to reduce the expression to a synonym for "rightly framed, that is sound and orthodox discourse." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Everyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
