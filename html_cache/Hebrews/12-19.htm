In the ancient Near Eastern context, trumpets were often used to signal important events or divine appearances. The trumpet blast at Sinai signified the presence of God and the seriousness of the covenant being established. This imagery is used to evoke the awe and fear associated with God's holiness and the giving of the Law.<p><b>or to a voice that made its hearers beg</b><br>The voice mentioned is the voice of God, which was so overwhelming and terrifying that the Israelites pleaded with Moses to speak to them instead, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>. This reflects the human response to the direct and powerful revelation of God, highlighting the fear and reverence due to His majesty. It underscores the idea that God's holiness is beyond human comprehension and can be overwhelming to sinful humanity.<p><b>that no further word be spoken</b><br>The Israelites' request that no further word be spoken to them directly by God emphasizes their recognition of their own unworthiness and the fear of divine judgment. This moment illustrates the need for a mediator between God and humanity, a role that Moses fulfilled at Sinai and that Jesus Christ fulfills in the New Covenant. It also points to the limitations of the Old Covenant, which was based on the Law and fear, in contrast to the New Covenant of grace and faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The location where God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses.

If the people trembled then, believers today must not treat God&#8217;s voice lightly (<a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Elsewhere, a divine trumpet announces decisive moments&#8212;<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a> at Jericho, <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1 and 8</a>:6 in judgment, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a> at Christ&#8217;s return. The consistent thread: a trumpet marks God&#8217;s direct intervention.<p>&#8226; Therefore, <a href="/hebrews/12-19.htm">Hebrews 12:19</a> reminds readers that the God who once shook Sinai still speaks; the gospel comes from the same holy voice, now calling us to draw near through Christ rather than shrink back in fear (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or to a voice that made its hearers beg that no further word be spoken</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;voice&#8221; is the audible speech of God that followed the trumpet (<a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24-27</a>). The Israelites pleaded, &#8220;Speak to us yourself and we will listen; but do not let God speak with us, or we will die.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their reaction exposes the gulf between sinful humanity and the righteous Lord. Even after consecration (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10-14</a>) the people could not bear unmediated revelation.<p>&#8226; Hebrews uses this memory to warn: if those who heard at Sinai recoiled, how much more accountable are we who hear the Son, our Mediator (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>; 2:1-3; 12:24)?<p>&#8226; Yet the verse also comforts. Because Jesus &#8220;speaks a better word than the blood of Abel&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>), we are invited to listen without terror (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14-18</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast heightens gratitude: we are not at a mountain of fear but at Zion, welcomed into a covenant secured by Christ&#8217;s blood (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/12-19.htm">Hebrews 12:19</a> points back to Sinai&#8217;s trumpet and thunderous voice to underline God&#8217;s unchanging holiness and the weight of His word. The verse says, in effect: remember how overwhelming that first revelation was; now realize that the same God speaks again through His Son. Because Jesus mediates a new covenant, we can approach with reverent confidence, but never with casual indifference.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) See <a href="/exodus/19-19.htm" title="And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.">Exodus 19:19</a> ("the voice of the trumpet"), <a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a> ("the voice of the words").<p><span class= "bld">Intreated.</span>--"If we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die" (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-25.htm" title="Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.">Deuteronomy 5:25</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-19.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.">Exodus 20:19</a>).

Mention of it is added here to show that the general fear extended even to Moses, the mediator). This whole account, thus powerfully condensed from Exodus and Deuteronomy, presents a vivid picture of the terrors of the Mosaic revelation. God was, indeed, revealed to man, but still as unseen and unapproachable, terrible in his wrath against sin, and surrounded by sounds and sights of fear. But now mark the serene and glorious contrast. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">to a trumpet</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#940;&#955;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(salpingos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4536.htm">Strong's 4536: </a> </span><span class="str2">A trumpet, the sound of a trumpet.
