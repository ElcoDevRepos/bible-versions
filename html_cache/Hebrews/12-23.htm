It reflects the joy and unity found in the presence of God, similar to the joy expressed in <a href="/psalms/100-2.htm">Psalm 100:2</a>, "Serve the LORD with gladness; come before His presence with singing." The assembly is not just a physical gathering but a spiritual one, indicating the unity of believers in Christ.<p><b>to the congregation of the firstborn</b><br>The term "firstborn" signifies preeminence and inheritance rights, as seen in the Old Testament with figures like Esau and Jacob. In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the "firstborn over all creation" (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), indicating His supremacy. The "congregation of the firstborn" refers to the church, those who are in Christ and share in His inheritance. This echoes the idea of believers being co-heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<p><b>enrolled in heaven</b><br>This phrase suggests a divine registry, akin to the book of life mentioned in <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>. It implies security and assurance of salvation for those whose names are written there. The concept of being "enrolled" indicates a formal acknowledgment by God, reflecting the ancient practice of recording citizens' names in a city register, ensuring their rights and privileges.<p><b>You have come to God the Judge of all</b><br>This highlights God's role as the ultimate judge, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. It underscores His sovereignty and justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/50-6.htm">Psalm 50:6</a>, "And the heavens proclaim His righteousness, for God Himself is judge." This phrase serves as a reminder of the accountability all creation has before God, aligning with the eschatological themes in the book of Hebrews.<p><b>to the spirits of the righteous made perfect</b><br>This refers to the completion and fulfillment of the saints' faith, as discussed earlier in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, the "Hall of Faith." The "righteous made perfect" indicates the final sanctification and glorification of believers, a process completed in the presence of God. It connects to the promise of perfection and eternal life found in passages like <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, "He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assembly_of_the_firstborn.htm">Assembly of the Firstborn</a></b><br>This refers to the collective body of believers who are considered the "firstborn" in Christ, indicating their privileged status and inheritance in the kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enrolled_in_heaven.htm">Enrolled in Heaven</a></b><br>This phrase signifies the believers whose names are written in the Book of Life, symbolizing their eternal citizenship in heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_judge_of_all.htm">God the Judge of All</a></b><br>This highlights God's role as the ultimate judge, emphasizing His authority and righteousness in judging all humanity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirits_of_the_righteous_made_perfect.htm">Spirits of the Righteous Made Perfect</a></b><br>This refers to the souls of believers who have been made perfect through Christ, indicating their sanctification and completion in the afterlife.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_citizenship.htm">Heavenly Citizenship</a></b><br>Believers are called to live with the awareness that their true citizenship is in heaven.

How characteristic of the writer and his theme is the introduction of these solemn words into the midst of this description of Christian privilege and blessing.<p><span class= "bld">And to the spirits of just men made perfect.</span>--The last verses of Hebrews 11 are at once called before the mind by these words. The "righteous" men have "by faith" run their course (<a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm" title="Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.">Hebrews 10:38</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm" title="By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.">Hebrews 11:7</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:12</a>); they have obtained the promises (<a href="/hebrews/6-15.htm" title="And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.">Hebrews 6:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm" title="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.">Hebrews 11:1</a>). The analogy of Scripture forbids us to consider their present state as the full consummation; for that, these "spirits" and we who are yet "in the body" await the day of the resurrection. These words, however, do not refer to the period of the Old Covenant only; indeed they do not in strictness belong to that period at all. The spirits of the righteous servants of Christ join the same fellowship; and only when Christ was manifested does the state to which the name "perfection" is thus given seem to have begun. What was received by those "spirits of the righteous" when they saw the day of Christ, we cannot tell; but. the teaching of Scripture seems to be that they were raised to some higher state of blessedness. These are the new inhabitants of the world above; they have come into the presence of God by means of the blood of sprinkling, through Jesus. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">in joyful assembly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#951;&#947;&#973;&#961;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(pan&#275;gyrei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3831.htm">Strong's 3831: </a> </span><span class="str2">A festival assembly.
