The earthly realm is associated with the Levitical priesthood, which was established under the Mosaic Law. Jesus' priesthood is of a different order, the order of Melchizedek, which is eternal and heavenly, as discussed in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>.<p><b>He would not be a priest</b><br>According to the Mosaic Law, priests had to be from the tribe of Levi, specifically descendants of Aaron. Jesus, being from the tribe of Judah, would not qualify for the Levitical priesthood. This highlights the distinction between the earthly priesthood and Christ's superior, eternal priesthood.<p><b>since there are already priests</b><br>The existence of the Levitical priesthood is acknowledged here. At the time of writing, the temple in Jerusalem was still standing, and the Levitical priests were actively performing their duties. This underscores the continuity of the old covenant practices even as the new covenant was being established through Christ.<p><b>who offer gifts according to the law</b><br>The Levitical priests offered sacrifices and gifts as prescribed by the Mosaic Law. These offerings were a central part of the old covenant, serving as a temporary measure to atone for sin.
