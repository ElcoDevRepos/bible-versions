This is documented in <a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>. The proclamation of the law was a foundational moment for the Israelites, establishing the covenant between God and His people. It underscores the importance of the law in guiding the moral and spiritual life of the community. Moses acted as a mediator, a role that prefigures Christ as the ultimate mediator of a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>).<p><b>he took the blood of calves and goats</b><br>The use of animal blood in sacrificial rituals was central to the Old Covenant. Blood symbolized life and was necessary for atonement, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>. The specific mention of calves and goats highlights the sacrificial system's complexity and the need for purification. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, whose blood would establish a new and better covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>).<p><b>along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop</b><br>These elements were part of the purification process. Water signifies cleansing, while scarlet wool and hyssop were used in ceremonial rites (<a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4-7</a>). Scarlet wool, dyed with a bright red color, symbolizes the blood and sacrifice, while hyssop, a plant used for sprinkling, represents purification and cleansing (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>). These elements point to the thoroughness required in the purification process, which Christ fulfills spiritually.<p><b>and sprinkled the scroll and all the people</b><br>The act of sprinkling blood on the scroll and the people signifies the ratification of the covenant. The scroll, containing the law, and the people, as recipients of the law, were both consecrated through this act. This ritual underscores the seriousness of the covenant and the people's commitment to obey God's commands. It prefigures the New Covenant, where believers are cleansed by the blood of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>, emphasizing the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator of the Old Covenant.

The "goats" may be included in the burnt offerings; for though Jewish tradition held that a goat was never sacrificed as a burnt offering, <a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10</a> is clear on the other side. It is possible that "the calves and the goats" may be only a general expression for "the sacrificial victims."

He "came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do." And then he wrote all the words of the LORD in a book, and builded an altar under the mount, and sacrifices were offered, and half of the blood was sprinkled on the altar, and the words were read from the book, and again the people undertook to observe them, and the other half of the blood was sprinkled on the people, and so the covenant was ratified. The essential part of the whole ceremony being the "blood-shedding," it is of no importance for the general argument that the account in Exodus is not exactly followed. The variations from it are these: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The mention of goats as well as calves or bullocks - of water - of the scarlet wool and hyssop - and of the sprinkling of the book, instead of the altar, as in Exodus. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The words spoken by Moses are differently given, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> being substituted for <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. On these variations we may observe that the mention of goats may have been suggested to the writer's mind by the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement, previously alluded to; and it is not <span class="accented">inconsistent</span> with the account in Exodus, where the victims used for the "burnt offerings" are not specified, only the bullocks for "peace offerings." Nor is there inconsistency in the other additions to the ceremonial. The scarlet wool and hyssop were the usual instruments of aspersion (a bunch of the latter being apparently bound by the former to a stick of cedar; cf. <a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>; <a href="/leviticus/14-50.htm">Leviticus 14:50</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6, 18</a>). It may have been usual to mix water with the blood used for aspersion, if only to prevent coagulation (see Lightfoot on <a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>), though in some cases certainly also with a symbolical meaning (cf. <a href="/leviticus/14-5.htm">Leviticus 14:5, 50</a>); and, if the book was, as it was likely to be, on the altar when the latter was sprinkled (<a href="/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6, 7</a>), it would itself partake of this sprinkling, and, being thus consecrated, would be then taken from the altar to be read from to the people and to receive their assent, previously to the sprinkling of themselves with the moiety of the blood reserved. Probably the whole account, as here given, was the traditional one at the time of writing (see below, on ver. 21). With regard to the slightly altered form of the words spoken by Moses, it is an interesting suggestion that the writer may have had in his mind our Lord's corresponding words in the institution of the Eucharist, beginning in all the accounts with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and being thus worded: in St. Luke, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: and in St. Matthew and St. Mark, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, St. Matthew adding <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.
