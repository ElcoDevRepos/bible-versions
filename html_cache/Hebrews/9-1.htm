This covenant is foundational to the Old Testament and includes the Law given through Moses. It is characterized by a system of laws, sacrifices, and rituals designed to set Israel apart as God's chosen people. This covenant is often contrasted with the New Covenant, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a> and <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>.<p><b>had regulations for worship</b><br>The regulations for worship under the first covenant were detailed and specific, encompassing various sacrifices, offerings, and rituals. These regulations are primarily found in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. They include instructions for burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings, among others. These regulations served to maintain the holiness of the people and their relationship with God, emphasizing the need for atonement and purification. They also foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law and provided a perfect atonement for sin.<p><b>and also an earthly sanctuary.</b><br>The "earthly sanctuary" refers to the Tabernacle, and later the Temple, which were physical structures where God's presence dwelled among His people. The Tabernacle, described in detail in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>, was a portable tent used during Israel's wilderness wanderings. It contained the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. The Temple, built by Solomon in Jerusalem, was a more permanent structure that continued the functions of the Tabernacle. These sanctuaries were central to Israel's worship and served as a type of the heavenly sanctuary, pointing to the ultimate dwelling of God with humanity through Jesus Christ, as elaborated in <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/first_covenant.htm">First Covenant</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Covenant, which was established between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai.

These regulations and structures were never arbitrary; they revealed God&#8217;s holiness, exposed humanity&#8217;s sin, and pointed ahead to the superior ministry of Christ in the true, heavenly sanctuary. In Him, every symbol finds its fulfillment, and every barrier to God&#8217;s presence is removed for those who trust in His finished work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>IX.</span><p>(1) The subject commenced in the last chapter (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1-6</a>) is continued here. The mention of the "more excellent ministry" led to the description of the new covenant with which it is united (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6-13</a>). This verse, then, attaches itself to the fifth and sixth verses of Hebrews 8 (<a href="/context/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5-6</a>): "Even the first (covenant), then, had ordinances of divine service and its sanctuary, of this world." The "service" is spoken of again in <a href="/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6</a>; the "ordinances" in <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a>, where they are called "carnal." Very similar is the language here, for the words so emphatically standing at the close of the verse are probably descriptive not of the "sanctuary" only, but also of the "ordinances." Both place and ministrations belonged to <span class= "ital">this world, </span>and thus stand in contrast with "the heavenly things," of which the Tabernacle was a token and shadow. (See Note on <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>.) The ordinary Greek text (here following the first printed Greek Testament) has "the first Tabernacle," and this reading was followed by Tyndale and Coverdale. All ancient MSS. omit the word; and, as in a long succession of verses "covenant" has been the leading thought, the rendering of the Authorised version is certainly correct. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then verily</span> (or, <span class="accented">now indeed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the first covenant also</span> (or, <span class="accented">even the first covenant</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>had ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary</span> (rather <span class="accented">its sanctuary of this world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>).
