The term "perfect" in this context does not imply that Jesus was imperfect before, but rather that He fulfilled His purpose through His suffering and obedience (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). The Greek word "teleio&#333;" suggests reaching a goal or completing a task. Jesus' perfection is tied to His role as the High Priest, who fully understands human suffering and temptation (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). This completion is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant.<p><b>He became the source of eternal salvation</b><br>Jesus is identified as the source, or "author," of eternal salvation, emphasizing His unique role in God's redemptive plan. This salvation is not temporary or limited but eternal, highlighting the permanence of His sacrifice. The concept of Jesus as the source connects to <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where He declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life. The idea of eternal salvation is rooted in the promises of the New Covenant, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises a lasting relationship with His people.<p><b>to all who obey Him</b><br>Obedience is a key theme in the New Testament, reflecting a response to faith. This phrase underscores that salvation is available to those who follow Jesus' teachings and commands (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Obedience is not merely about following rules but involves a transformative relationship with Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>, which speaks of the "obedience of faith." This obedience is a mark of true discipleship and aligns with the call to live according to the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is described as having been "made perfect" and becoming the "source of eternal salvation."

See also Gesenius on the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Hence, and in view of the drift of the passage before us, Jackson very decidedly regards <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 9 as a <span class="accented">verbum solenne</span>, denoting specifically Christ's <span class="accented">consecration</span> to his eternal office of High Priest. So also Hammond and Whitby. Being thus perfected, or consecrated, he became, for ever afterwards, the Author, not of mere ceremonial cleansing or temporary remission of guilt, but of eternal salvation; <span class="accented">potentially</span> to all mankind (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>), and <span class="accented">effectively to</span> "<span class="accented">all</span> them that obey him;" being addressed, in tiffs his consummated position (the reference being to <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) as "High Priest for ever," etc. Here again we perceive that it is not till after the Resurrection that the prophetic ideal of the SON at God's right hand, and of the eternal High Priest, are regarded as fully realized. If it be objected that his high priesthood must have begun <span class="accented">before</span> the Resurrection for his death upon the cross to be a true atonement, it may be replied that his one oblation of himself upon the cross at once consummated his consecration and effected the atonement. Doubtless, as a true High Priest on earth, he thus "offered one sacrifice for sins for ever" (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>); all that is meant above is that it was not till after the Resurrection that he entered on his eternal office of mediation in virtue of that one accomplished sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">having been made perfect,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(telei&#333;theis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5048.htm">Strong's 5048: </a> </span><span class="str2">From teleios; to complete, i.e. accomplish, or consummate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He became</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(egeneto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] source</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(aitios)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_159.htm">Strong's 159: </a> </span><span class="str2">The cause, author; the culprit, the accused; the crime.
