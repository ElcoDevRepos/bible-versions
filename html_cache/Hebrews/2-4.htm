In biblical context, God often affirms His word through supernatural means. This is consistent with the Old Testament, where God confirmed His covenant and promises through signs, such as the rainbow with Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12-17</a>) and the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12). The affirmation by God underscores the authority and truth of the gospel message, aligning with the New Testament theme that God actively participates in the revelation of His word.<p><b>through signs,</b><br>Signs in the biblical sense are miraculous events that point to a deeper spiritual truth. In the New Testament, signs often accompany the ministry of Jesus and the apostles, serving as evidence of divine authority and the inbreaking of God's kingdom. For example, Jesus turning water into wine at Cana (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>) is described as the first of His signs, revealing His glory and leading His disciples to believe in Him. Signs are not just wonders but are meant to lead people to faith and understanding of God's purposes.<p><b>wonders,</b><br>Wonders are extraordinary events that evoke awe and amazement, often leaving witnesses in a state of reverence or fear. In the biblical narrative, wonders are closely associated with God's power and majesty. The parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-31</a>) is a classic example of a wonder that demonstrated God's deliverance and might. In the New Testament, wonders performed by Jesus and the apostles served to authenticate their divine mission and message, drawing attention to the reality of God's intervention in human history.<p><b>various miracles,</b><br>Miracles are acts of divine intervention that transcend natural laws, showcasing God's sovereignty over creation. The Gospels and Acts are replete with accounts of miracles, such as healings, exorcisms, and resurrections, which confirm the presence and power of God. These miracles serve as a testament to Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the truth of the apostolic witness. They also fulfill Old Testament prophecies about the coming of the Messiah, who would perform miraculous deeds (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><b>and gifts of the Holy Spirit</b><br>The gifts of the Holy Spirit are spiritual endowments given to believers for the edification of the church and the advancement of God's kingdom. These gifts, detailed in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a> and <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-8</a>, include wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, prophecy, and more. The distribution of these gifts is a sign of the Spirit's active presence in the church, empowering believers to carry out their mission and bear witness to the gospel.<p><b>distributed according to His will.</b><br>This phrase highlights the sovereignty of God in the distribution of spiritual gifts. It underscores that the Holy Spirit gives gifts as He determines, not based on human merit or desire, but according to divine purpose and plan. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and wisdom in orchestrating His redemptive work. It also encourages believers to trust in God's perfect will and to use their gifts for His glory and the common good, as emphasized in <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of authority and power, who confirms His message through supernatural means.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who distributes spiritual gifts according to God's will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs,_wonders,_and_miracles.htm">Signs, Wonders, and Miracles</a></b><br>Supernatural acts that serve as evidence of God's power and confirmation of His message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/recipients_of_the_message.htm">Recipients of the Message</a></b><br>Early Christians and believers who witnessed these divine acts as a testament to the truth of the Gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostolic_era.htm">The Apostolic Era</a></b><br>The period during which the apostles spread the Gospel, often accompanied by miraculous signs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_confirmation.htm">Divine Confirmation</a></b><br>God uses supernatural means to confirm His message, emphasizing the reliability and truth of the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is active in distributing gifts, highlighting the importance of spiritual gifts in the life of the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_evidence.htm">Faith and Evidence</a></b><br>While faith is essential, God provides evidence through miracles to strengthen and affirm our belief.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The distribution of gifts and the occurrence of miracles are according to God's will, reminding us of His ultimate authority and plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_and_testimony.htm">Witness and Testimony</a></b><br>Believers are called to be witnesses of God's power, sharing how He has worked in their lives through signs and wonders.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_2_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_2_4_God_s_testimony_via_miracles.htm">How does Hebrews 2:4 affirm God's testimony through "signs, wonders, and miracles"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Holy_Spirit_gifts_confirm_God.htm">What role do "gifts of the Holy Spirit" play in confirming God's message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_see_God_s_work_in_signs_today.htm">How can we discern God's work today through "signs and wonders"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Hebrews_2_4_to_Matthew_28_18-20.htm">How does Hebrews 2:4 connect with the Great Commission in Matthew 28:18-20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_do_believers_find_Holy_Spirit_s_gifts.htm">How can believers today seek and recognize the Holy Spirit's gifts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Heb_2_4_confirm_divine_signs.htm">How does Hebrews 2:4 affirm the authenticity of divine miracles and signs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_signs_and_wonders_in_Hebrews_2_4.htm">Why does God use signs and wonders according to Hebrews 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Gifts_of_Spirit_in_Hebrews_2_4.htm">How do gifts of the Holy Spirit relate to Hebrews 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_hebrews_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Hebrews 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_no_evidence_for_biblical_miracles.htm">Hebrews 2:4 mentions &#8220;signs, wonders, and miracles&#8221;&#8212;why is there no verifiable historical or archaeological evidence for these supernatural events?

The words here used are illustrated especially by <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2Corinthians 12:12</a>, in its reference to miracles as attesting the apostolic preaching.

The idea is that the hearers of "the Lord" testified, and God attested their testimony by the signs that accompanied their ministry. The passage is instructive as expressing the grounds of <span class="accented">acceptance</span> of the gospel. Its truth was already "confirmed" to believers by the testimony of unimpeachable witnesses to that which, so attested, carried with it its own evidence. But the signs attending the apostolic ministry were granted for further attestation. Thus "signs and wonders," the craving for which as a condition of belief was so condemned by our Lord, have their true evidential value assigned them. They did not furnish the original basis of belief, which rested on Christ himself, his Person. and his work, as unimpeachably attested. They came in only as suitable accompaniments of a Divine dispensation, and as additional confirmations. The apologists of the last generation were given to rest the evidence of Christianity too exclusively on miracles. The tendency of the present age is to dwell rather on its internal evidence, and, so far as it can be done, to explain away the miracles. They are not to be explained away, having been, as has been said, fitting accompaniments and confirmations of such a dispensation as the gospel was. But to us, as well as to those early believers, they are not the first or main ground of our belief. To us, as re them, Christ and his gospel, testified to as they are by" them that heard," are their own sufficient evidence. Indeed, the cogency of the "signs" in the way of evidence is less now than formerly, since they too have now passed into the category of things that rest on testimony. The evidential counterpart to them in our case is the continued attestation which God gives to the gospel in its living power on the souls of men, and its results in the world before our eyes. It is thus that our faith is strengthened in "the salvation at first spoken through the Lord, and confirmed to us by them that heard." Four expressions are used for the miraculous accompaniments of the first preaching of the gospel, denoting, apparently, not so much different classes of miracles, as different ways of regarding them.
