The recipients of the letter to the Hebrews are commended for their empathy and solidarity with fellow believers who were incarcerated. This reflects the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized caring for the imprisoned (<a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>). The act of sympathizing with prisoners was a tangible expression of Christian love and community, aligning with the broader biblical mandate to remember those in chains as if bound with them (<a href="/hebrews/13-3.htm">Hebrews 13:3</a>).<p><b>and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property</b><br>The early Christians often faced persecution, which included the loss of personal property. The joy with which they accepted this loss is reminiscent of the apostles' response to suffering for Christ's name (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>). This attitude reflects a deep trust in God's provision and a focus on spiritual rather than material wealth. The confiscation of property was a common tactic used by authorities to suppress the spread of Christianity, yet the believers' joyful acceptance highlights their unwavering faith and hope in eternal rewards.<p><b>knowing that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession</b><br>This phrase underscores the believers' assurance in the eternal inheritance promised through Christ. The "better and permanent possession" refers to the heavenly treasures and eternal life that await the faithful (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). This assurance is rooted in the new covenant established by Jesus, which offers a lasting relationship with God. The contrast between temporary earthly possessions and eternal heavenly rewards is a recurring theme in Scripture, encouraging believers to prioritize their spiritual inheritance over worldly gains.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipients_of_hebrews.htm">The Recipients of Hebrews</a></b><br>Early Jewish Christians who were facing persecution and were tempted to revert to Judaism to avoid suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prisoners.htm">Prisoners</a></b><br>Likely fellow believers who were imprisoned for their faith, highlighting the early church's experience of persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/confiscation_of_property.htm">Confiscation of Property</a></b><br>Represents the tangible losses suffered by believers due to their faith, a common occurrence in the early church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_possession.htm">Heavenly Possession</a></b><br>The eternal inheritance promised to believers, contrasting with temporary earthly possessions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution.htm">Persecution</a></b><br>The broader context of suffering for faith in Christ, a theme throughout the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_suffering.htm">Joy in Suffering</a></b><br>Believers are called to find joy in suffering for Christ, knowing it aligns them with His sufferings and promises eternal reward.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Earthly losses are temporary; our focus should be on the eternal inheritance that cannot be taken away.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_support.htm">Community Support</a></b><br>The early church's example of supporting imprisoned believers challenges us to care for those suffering for their faith today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>Trusting in God's promises enables believers to face persecution without fear, knowing their true security is in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_living.htm">Sacrificial Living</a></b><br>The willingness to lose earthly possessions for the sake of Christ calls us to evaluate our attachment to material things.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_10_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 10:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Heb_10_34_inspire_support.htm">How does Hebrews 10:34 encourage us to support fellow believers facing persecution?

The rendering "possessions" is necessary because a similar word ("substance" in the Authorised version) will immediately occur. In the last clause two remarkable changes in the Greek text are made necessary by the testimony of our best authorities. The words "in heaven" must certainly be removed; they are omitted in the oldest MSS., and are evidently an explanatory comment which has found its way into the text. For the reading, "in yourselves," there is hardly any evidence whatever. The MSS. are divided between two readings, "yourselves" and "for yourselves;" the former having also the support of the Latin and Coptic versions. There is little doubt that we must read "yourselves;" and the most probable translation will now be, <span class= "ital">perceiving that ye have your own selves for a better possession and one that abideth.</span> They had been taught the meaning of the words spoken by Jesus of the man who gains the world and loses himself (<a href="/luke/9-25.htm" title="For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?">Luke 9:25</a>), and of those who win their souls by their endurance (<a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>); so in <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a> the writer speaks of "the gaining of the soul." Thus trained, they could accept with joy the loss of possessions for the sake of Christ, perceiving that in Him they had received <span class= "ital">themselves</span> as a possession, a better and a lasting possession. (It would be possible to render the clause, "knowing that ye yourselves have a better possession," &c.; but the parallelism of <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a> renders it almost certain that the former view of the words is correct.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye had compassion on those who were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession, and an abiding one.</span> For <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which the A.V., so as to avoid the impropriety of expressing sympathy with the bonds themselves, renders "me in my bonds." Even apart from manuscript authority, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is evidently to be preferred, both as suiting the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and as being more likely to have been altered to the common Pauline expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, than <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, especially on the supposition of the writer being St. Paul himself. Thus no evidence as to the authorship of the Epistle is hence deducible. The allusion is to persecutions of Christians, under which the Hebrews addressed had been plundered, and had succored others who were prisoners for the faith, as is intimated also in <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>.
