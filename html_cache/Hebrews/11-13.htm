Their faith was characterized by trust in God's promises, even when those promises were not fulfilled in their lifetimes. This highlights the enduring nature of true faith, which is not contingent on immediate results. The concept of dying in faith is echoed in the lives of many biblical figures who trusted in God's plan beyond their earthly existence, such as Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24-25</a>) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>without having received the things they were promised</b><br>The promises referred to include the land, descendants, and blessings given to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). Although they did not see the complete fulfillment of these promises, they believed in God's faithfulness. This anticipates the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the seed of Abraham (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>) and through whom all nations are blessed. The promises also point to the eternal inheritance believers have in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><b>However, they saw them and welcomed them from afar</b><br>This phrase suggests a spiritual perception and acceptance of God's promises, even when they were not physically realized. It reflects the idea of seeing with the eyes of faith, as Abraham did when he looked forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God (<a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10</a>). This anticipates the heavenly Jerusalem and the eternal kingdom (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>). The patriarchs' ability to "see" from afar demonstrates their understanding of God's redemptive plan, which transcends time and space.<p><b>And they acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth</b><br>This acknowledgment reflects a mindset of living as temporary residents in this world, with a focus on the eternal home promised by God. The language of "strangers and exiles" is reminiscent of Abraham's life as a sojourner in Canaan (<a href="/genesis/23-4.htm">Genesis 23:4</a>) and the Israelites' experience in Egypt and Babylon. It underscores the Christian's identity as a pilgrim on earth, with citizenship in heaven (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>). This perspective encourages believers to live with a heavenly focus, as Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_patriarchs.htm">The Patriarchs</a></b><br>This verse refers to the patriarchs mentioned earlier in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who lived by faith and trusted in God's promises despite not seeing them fulfilled in their lifetimes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The patriarchs were promised a land by God, which they did not possess during their lifetimes.
