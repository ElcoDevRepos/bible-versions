In Jewish tradition, angels were highly revered as messengers of God, but they were never given the title of "Son." This rhetorical question highlights the superiority of Christ over angels, a key theme in the book of Hebrews. The author is addressing a Jewish audience familiar with the Old Testament, where angels are often mentioned but never in the context of being God's Son.<p><b>&#8220;You are My Son;</b><br>This declaration is a direct reference to <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, a royal psalm that was originally used in the context of the coronation of Israelite kings. In the New Testament, this verse is applied to Jesus, affirming His divine sonship and messianic kingship. The title "Son" signifies a unique relationship with God, indicating both divinity and authority.<p><b>today I have become Your Father&#8221;?</b><br>The phrase "today I have become Your Father" signifies a specific point in time, often interpreted as the resurrection or ascension of Christ, where His divine sonship is publicly declared and affirmed. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of adoption or declaration of kingship, where a king would be publicly recognized as the son of a deity. In the context of Jesus, it underscores His eternal relationship with the Father and His role as the promised Messiah.<p><b>Or again:</b><br>This introduces another scriptural reference to further support the argument of Christ's superiority over angels. The author of Hebrews frequently uses Old Testament quotations to build a case for the preeminence of Christ, appealing to the authority of Scripture.<p><b>&#8220;I will be His Father, and He will be My Son&#8221;?</b><br>This is a quotation from <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, part of the Davidic Covenant, where God promises David that his offspring will have a special relationship with Him. While this initially referred to Solomon, its ultimate fulfillment is found in Jesus Christ, the descendant of David. This covenantal promise highlights the eternal kingship and divine sonship of Jesus, setting Him apart from all other beings, including angels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The speaker in the verse, emphasizing His unique relationship with Jesus Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "My Son," highlighting His divine sonship and superiority over angels.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God, serving as messengers and ministers, but not given the title of "Son" in the same way as Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_testament_references.htm">Old Testament References</a></b><br>The verse quotes from Psalms and 2 Samuel, showing the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy in Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is debated, the author seeks to establish Christ's supremacy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unique_sonship_of_christ.htm">The Unique Sonship of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus is uniquely the Son of God, a title not given to any angel.

Angels are magnificent (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>) and serve in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>), yet nowhere does Scripture grant them filial equality with the Father.<p>- Hebrews has just declared that the Son &#8220;has become as much superior to the angels as the name He has inherited is excellent beyond theirs&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>). This verse explains why.<p>- Angels are:<p>&#8226; created beings (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>)<p>&#8226; ministering spirits sent to serve believers (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>)<p>&#8226; never invited to sit at the Father&#8217;s right hand (contrast <a href="/hebrews/1-13.htm">Hebrews 1:13</a>).<p>- By asking &#8220;to which,&#8221; the author underscores that not one angel&#8212;not Michael (<a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>), not Gabriel (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>)&#8212;was granted the title &#8220;Son&#8221; in the sense given to Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You are My Son; today I have become Your Father&#8221;</b><p>- Quoted from <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, a coronation psalm announcing God&#8217;s anointed King.<p>- &#8220;My Son&#8221; points to relationship, authority, and shared nature (<a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>).<p>- &#8220;Today&#8221; speaks to a specific moment of public declaration:<p>&#8226; His incarnation (<a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>)<p>&#8226; His baptism, where the Father&#8217;s voice proclaimed, &#8220;You are My beloved Son&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-11.htm">Mark 1:11</a>)<p>&#8226; His resurrection, when God &#8220;raised Him from the dead, as it is written, &#8216;You are My Son; today I have become Your Father&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33</a>; see also <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;I have become Your Father&#8221; does not imply Jesus had a beginning. It signals the Father&#8217;s open acknowledgment of the eternal Son in redemptive history&#8212;first in promise, then in incarnation, finally in exaltation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or again</b><p>- A second citation strengthens the point, following the biblical principle that &#8220;every matter must be established by two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).<p>- By introducing another Old Testament text, the author shows that the exclusive Sonship of Christ is woven throughout Scripture, not hinged on a single proof-text.<p>- Repetition reminds readers that what God never said to angels, He said twice about His Messiah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I will be His Father, and He will be My Son&#8221;</b><p>- Drawn from God&#8217;s covenant with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>; echoed in <a href="/1_chronicles/17-13.htm">1 Chronicles 17:13</a>).

Second Samuel 7:14 unveils a covenant guarantee that the Messianic King would enjoy a perpetual Father-Son relationship. Together these texts underline Christ&#8217;s supremacy, validate His royal and redemptive mission, and assure believers that the One who speaks for us in heaven is not merely an exalted creature but the very Son of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">For unto which of the angels . . . . </span>"God has spoken of the Messiah as His Son, a title which no angel ever receives from Him." That the appellation "sons of God" may be used in an inferior sense, and that thus angels may be so designated (<a href="/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?">Job 38:7</a>), does not affect this argument; for every reader must perceive that in these quotations "Son" is used of One, and in a sense that is unique The two quotations are taken from <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm" title="I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:">2Samuel 7:14</a>. It seems probable that the second Psalm was written by David during the troublous times of 2 Samuel 8-10, in the fresh recollection of the promises of which we read in 2 Samuel 7. In the midst of the rebellious conspiracies of kings and nations is heard Jehovah's word, "Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion" (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>). In <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a> the Anointed King declares the divine decree, "The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee;" and the following verses describe the kingly dominion of the Son. The clearest comments on <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a> are supplied by <a href="/context/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2Samuel 7:12-14</a>, and especially by <a href="/psalms/89-27.htm" title="Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.">Psalm 89:27</a> of the last-named Psalm, "I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth," shows plainly that in their first meaning--that which relates to the royal rule of David or David's son--the words "I have this day begotten thee" signify "I have this day established thee as my chosen king, and thus constituted thee my son;" for to the firstborn belongs natural, though derived, rule over the kingdom of his father. At what period the people in general, guided by prophetic teaching and the discipline of history (see below), learnt in how secondary a sense such words could be used of any human king, we do not know; but we have clear evidence, both from the <span class= "ital">New</span> Testament (<a href="/hebrews/5-5.htm" title="So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, You are my Son, to day have I begotten you.">Hebrews 5:5</a>; <a href="/context/acts/4-25.htm" title="Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?">Acts 4:25-27</a>; <a href="/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-27.htm" title="And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.">Revelation 2:27</a>) and from Jewish tradition, that the second Psalm was understood to be a distinct prophecy of the Messiah; indeed, this very name "Messiah" and the appellation "Son of God" (see <a href="/john/1-34.htm" title="And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.">John 1:34</a>; <a href="/john/1-49.htm" title="Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.">John 1:49</a>) may be traced to this Psalm. The declarations of <a href="/context/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6-7</a>, are typical of the enthronement of the Messiah. St. Paul (<a href="/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>) refers the words here quoted to the period of the Resurrection. With this the language used above (<a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm" title="Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.">Hebrews 1:4</a>) perfectly agrees. As, however, in that verse the exaltation of the Christ is declared to correspond to that <span class= "ital">essential</span> dignity which lay in the name Son, a name which in this very context bears its highest sense (<a href="/context/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>), we are constrained to regard the "day" of the Resurrection as itself typical, and to believe that "this day" also pointed to the "eternal Now"--to what Origen (on <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>) speaks of as "the day which is co-extensive with the unbegotten and everlasting life of God." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>. - THE SON SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS. Here the argumentation of the Epistle begins, the thesis of the first section of the argument having been given, as aforesaid, in the preceding verse, that "the SON is superior to the angels." The second section begins at <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>, the thesis being that "the SON is superior to Moses." Through <span class="accented">angels</span> and <span class="accented">Moses</span> the Law was given: "Ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator" (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>), the "mediator" being Moses. To show that the Son, in the Old Testament itself, is represented as above both, is to show, what it is the main purpose of the whole Epistle to establish, that the gospel, given through the SON, is above the Law, and intended to supersede it. The conclusion is that the gospel stands in the same relation to the Law as does the Son to angels, who are but "ministering spirits," and to Moses, who was but a "servant." With regard to the agency of angels in the giving of the Law, we do not find it so evident in the Old Testament as might have been expected from the references to it in the New. The "angel of Lord," who appeared to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and went before the people (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>, etc.), seems in the earlier books of the Bible to signify a certain presence and manifestation of the Lord himself, rather than a created minister of his will (see <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7, 13</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-15.htm">Genesis 22:15, 16</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2, 4</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20, 21</a>; cf. <a href="/acts/7-31.htm">Acts 7:31, 35, 38</a>); and this has been identified by theologians with the <span class="accented">Word</span>, not yet incarnate, through whom all Divine communications have been made to men. It is to be observed, however, that, after the sin of the golden calf, a distinction seems to be made between the presence of the <span class="accented">Lend</span> with his people and that of the angel to be thenceforth <span class="accented">sent</span> before them (<a href="/exodus/33-2.htm">Exodus 33:2, 3</a>). Ebrard sees in the "angel of the LORD" generally, though understood as signifying a Divine presence, a justification of the statement that the Law was given "through angels," on the ground that, though God did so manifest <span class="accented">himself</span>, it was not a direct manifestation, as in the Son, but through forms borrowed from the sphere of the angels. It was an <span class="accented">angelophany</span>, denoting an unseen Divine presence, not a true <span class="accented">theophany.</span> The only distinct allusion to "angels," in the plural, in connection with the giving of the Law, is in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, "He came with ten thousands of saints;" with which comp. <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>. But there is no doubt that it came afterwards to be the accepted rabbinical view that the dispensers of the Law were angels - whether as attendants on the Divine Majesty, or as agents of the fiery phenomena on Mount Sinai (natural operations being often attributed to angels), or as the utterers of the voice that was heard. "Locutus est Deus per angeles" (Bengel). And the writers of the New Testament plainly recognize this view (see below, <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>). Hence our author takes for granted that his readers will understand and recognize it, and so implies it in his argument, expressing, as it does, a true conception of the nature of the Mosaic dispensation, and especially of its relation to the gospel. To resume our view of the argument that follows. The first section (as aforesaid) is from <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a> to Hebrews 3:1, having for its thesis <span class="accented">the superiority of the</span> SON <span class="accented">to angels.</span> The second section is from <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a> to Hebrews 5:1, having for its thesis the superiority of the Son to Moses. Each section consists of two main divisions, between which in each case an appropriate exhortation is interposed; the first division in each case treating of what the Son is in his own person, the second of his work for man; and both sections leading separately to the conclusion that he is the <span class="accented">High Priest of humanity.</span> Then, in <a href="/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>, the subject of his priesthood is taken up. Ebrard happily illustrates the symmetrical plan of the argument thus: "The author, having thus been led from these two different starting-points to the idea of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, now proceeds to place on the two first parts, which may be viewed as the pillars of the arch, the third part, which forms the keystone." In this third part it begins to be shown, at <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>, how Christ fulfilled in his humanity the essential idea of priesthood. But, for reasons that will appear, the full doctrine of his eternal priesthood is not entered upon till <a href="/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1 - 10:19</a>, which may be called the central portion of the whole Epistle. The remainder (<a href="/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a> - end) may be distinguished from the rest as being the distinctly hortatory part (though her-ration has been frequently interposed in the argument), being mainly devoted to practical application of the doctrine that has been established. The following plan of the argument of the first two sections, showing the parallelism between them, may assist us in entering into it as it proceeds: - <span class="cmt_word">SECTION I.</span> <span class="accented">Thesis:</span> Christ superior to the angels. <span class="accented">Division</span> 1 (<a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5-2:1</a>). The name SON, as applied to the typical theocratic kings, and in its final reference and full meaning (as you all acknowledge) pointing to the Messiah, expresses a position altogether above any assigned anywhere to angels. The Son is represented as one associated with God in his majesty, a sharer of his everlasting throne. Angels are referred to only as ministering spirits or attendant worshippers at the Son's advent. <span class="accented">Interposed exhortation</span> (<a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1-5</a>). This being so, beware of not appreciating the revelation now given in the Son. In transgression of the Law given through angels was so severely visited, what will be the consequence of neglecting <span class="accented">this</span>, accredited to us as it has been? <span class="accented">Division</span> 2 (<a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5-3:1</a>). The Son also, but never angels, is denoted in prophecy as Lord of the <span class="accented">coming age.</span> For the eighth psalm (based on and carrying out the idea of the account in Genesis of the original creation) assigns a supremacy over all created things to <span class="accented">man.</span> Man, as he is now, does not fulfill the ideal of his destiny. But Christ, as Son of man, in his exaltation, does. And in him man attains his destined dignity forfeited through sin. His humiliation, suffering and death were for the purpose of thus raising man. His humiliation with this and was a design worthy of God, and in accordance with the purport of Messianic prophecy. For such prophecy intimates association and sympathy of the Messiah with his human brethren. Thus Christ, the SON, is the sympathizing <span class="accented">High Priest of humanity.</span> <span class="cmt_word">SECTION II.</span> <span class="accented">Thesis-</span> Christ superior to Moses. <span class="accented">Division</span> 1 (<a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-7</a>). Moses is represented in the Old Testament as but a <span class="accented">servant in</span> the house of God. The SON is <span class="accented">lord over</span> the house. <span class="accented">Interposed exhortation</span> (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-4:1</a>). This being so, beware of hardening your hearts, like the Israelites under Moses. If they failed, through unbelief, of entering into the rest offered to <span class="accented">them</span>, you may similarly fail of entering into the rest intended for <span class="accented">you.</span> <span class="accented">Division</span> 2 (<a href="/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1-5:1</a>). A rest, symbolized by that of the promised land, <span class="accented">is</span> still offered to you, and you <span class="accented">may</span> enter into it. The ninetieth psalm shows that the rest into which Joshua led the Israelites was not the final one intended for God's people. The true rest is the rest of God himself (" my rest," <a href="/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>.), spoken of in the account of the creation - the sabbath rest of eternity. Christ, after sharing our human trials, has passed into that eternal rest, and won an entrance into it for us. Thus, again, a renewed exhortation being interposed, Christ, the SON, is again set forth as the sympathizing <span class="accented">High Priest of humanity.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For to which of the angels said he at any time</span>. Observe the form of the question, which has been already noticed. It is not, "When were angels ever called sons?" but to this effect: "To which of them did he ever speak (individually) in the following remarkable terms?" The first quotation is from <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; the second from <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>. The second having had undoubtedly a primary reference to Solomon, and the first presumably to some king of Israel, probably to David, we may here properly pause to consider the principle of the application of such passages to Christ. It must be allowed that, not only in this Epistle, but in the New Testament generally, sayings which had a primary reference to events or personages in the past, are applied directly to Christ; and in some cases where the justness of the application may not be to all of us at first sight obvious. With regard to this usage, Bengel says, "Veri interpretes verborum divinorum sunt apostoli; etiamsi nos sine illis talem sententiam non assigneremur." But such applications are plainly not arbitrary. They rest on a principle of interpretation which it is of importance for us to understand. First, we may observe that the method was not originated by the New Testament writers; it was one received among the Jews of their time, who saw throughout the Old Testament anticipations of the Messiah. This appears both from rabbinical literature and also from the New Testament itself. For instance, the priests and scribes consulted by Herod (<a href="/matthew/2-5.htm">Matthew 2:5</a>) referred <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> as a matter of course to the Messiah; and the Pharisees (<a href="/matthew/22-44.htm">Matthew 22:44</a>) never thought of disputing the application of <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. to him. And not only so. The Old Testament itself suggests and exemplifies such applications. For students of the prophetic writings must be aware how utterances that had a primary fulfillment in one age are sometimes taken up in a subsequent one as though yet to be fulfilled, their scope enlarged, and their final reference often thrown forward to "that day" - the Messianic age  - which alone terminates the view of the later prophets. Now, it has been said, in explanation of this mode of treatment, that prophecy often had a double meaning, referring partly to one thing and partly to another; or several meanings, with reference to several different things. But this way of putting the matter is unsatisfactory. Bacon better hit the mark, when, in a well-known passage in his 'Advancement of Learning' (bk. 2.), he spoke of "that latitude which is agreeable and familiar unto Divine prophecies, being of the nature of their Author, with whom a thousand years are but as one day, and therefore are not fulfilled punctually at once, but have springing and germinant accomplishment throughout many ages; though the height or fullness of them may refer to some one age." We may put it thus: It was of the nature of prophetic inspiration to lift the seer above and beyond his immediate subject to the contemplation of some grand <span class="accented">ideal</span>, which it suggested to his vision, and more or less perfectly fulfilled. He has, for instance, as the basis of his vision, a David, a Solomon, a Hezekiah, or a Zerubbabel; he has as its framework the circumstances of his own time or of the time near at hand; but we find his language, as he proceeds, rising far above his vision's original scope, and applicable to those comprised within it only so far as they embody and realize the ideal which they represent to his mind. Hence the taking up of old prophecies by succeeding prophets, their enlargement and reapplication to new fulfillments; and this, too, in terms transcending the reality of these new fulfillments; as, for instance, when Isaiah, taking up the idea of Nathan's message to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>.), applies it apparently to a son and a reign to be looked for in his own age, but at length in language which can have no other than a Messianic reference (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, etc.; Isaiah 11:1, etc.; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>). Hence, lastly, the application in the New Testament of all such ancient utterances at once to Christ, as being the final and complete fulfillment of the ideal of prophecy, the true Antitype of all the types. A clear perception of this view of the drift of prophecy will remove difficulties that have been felt as to the application of many quotations from the Old Testament, in this Epistle and elsewhere, to Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee</span>; a quotation from <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>. This psalm is expressly quoted as David's in <a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>, and has internal evidence of being his, and of having had primary reference to his reign. For the mention of Zion (ver. 6) precludes an earlier date, while the circumstances of warfare alluded to do not agree with the peaceful reign of Solomon, nor the picture of undivided empire with any period after the secession of the ten tribes. Further, the rising and consequent subjugation by David of subject races, described in <a href="/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a>, presents to us a state of things very likely to have suggested the psalm; and to this period of David's reign it is usually referred with probability by modern commentators. But the question of date and authorship is not material to our view of the prophetic meaning of the psalm. Taking it to be David's, we find as follows: There is a rebellious confederation of subject kings against the dominion of the King of Israel, who is spoken of as "the Anointed" of the LORD. In view of their hostile preparations, the LORD in heaven is conceived as laughing to scorn their devices against him whom he himself had enthroned on Zion. Then the king speaks, "I will declare the decree [or, 'I will tell of a decree']; the Load said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and for thy possession the ends of the earth." Then follows an admonition to the rebels to do homage to this SON, submission to whom is submission to the Loan, and whose anger is as the LORD'S anger. Now, it is evident that the language used transcends <span class="accented">literal</span> application to any earthly king. Hence some commentators have been led to suppose that it had no even primary reference to one, being simply prophetic of the Messiah, though suggested by the circumstances of David's day. Thus Ebrard, supporting his view by the assumption (which is usually made) of the message of Nathan to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>) being the "decree" referred to in the psalm, and the foundation of the confidence expressed in it. He argues that it was not to David, but to his posterity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>), that the position of sonship was assigned, and eternal dominion promised; and hence that David in this psalm (which he considers to have been certainly by him) must have been speaking, not in his own name, but in that of his seed after him, looking adoringly forward to the fulfillment of that glorious hope in the <span class="accented">distant future</span> (<a href="/2_samuel/7-19.htm">2 Samuel 7:19</a>). Thus, he concludes, the insurrection of the Syrians forms merely the <span class="accented">occasion</span>, but not the <span class="accented">object</span> and <span class="accented">import</span>, of the second psalm. But, even if the message of Nathan were certainly the basis of the idea of the psalm, we find an instance of the express application of that message to David himself; as well as to his posterity, in <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>. (see vers. 20-28). It may be, however, that the reference in the psalm is to some Divine intimation, possibly to some prophecy or oracular utterance, delivered to David himself at the time of the inauguration of his own sovereignty, and long before Nathan's message. In any case, it is in accordance with the genius of prophecy, as above explained, that the words should have had a primary reference to David himself, so far forth as he imperfectly fulfilled their meaning. The main thing to be observed is that they represent an ideal of sonship and unlimited sovereignty beyond any that could, as a matter of fact, be considered as fulfilled in David. And this <span class="accented">view</span> of its meaning, suggested by the psalm itself, is confirmed by the use made of it in later Scripture. For it is evident that this psalm, together with the passage from <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. (to be cited next) is made the basis of a long series of Messianic prophecies (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>; <a href="/psalms/132.htm">Psalm 132</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1, 10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>; <a href="/micah/4.htm">Micah 4-5</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>, etc.). Its application to Christ in the New Testament is distinct and frequent (cf. <a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>; <a href="/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>). As to the phrase, "This day have I begotten thee," there is a difference of view among both ancient and modern expositors. The word "begotten" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) naturally suggests <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>, and is hence taken by some as referring to the eternal generation of the Son; in which case it can have had no application in any conceivable sense to the human type. "This day" has also in this case to be explained as denoting the ever-present today of eternity. So Origen, in a striking passage, "It is said to him by God, to whom it is always today. For God has no evening, nor (as I deem) any morning, but the time which is coextensive with his own unbegotten and eternal life is (if I may so speak) the day in which the Son is begotten, there being thus found no beginning of his generation, as neither is there of the day." Athanasius takes the same view; also Basil, Primasius, Thomas Aquinas, and many others. The main objection to it is the inapplicability of such a meaning of the words, even in a subordinate sense, to David or any other king of Israel. Alford, indeed, urges that this meaning agrees best with the context in the Epistle, on the ground that the eternal being of the Son, having been stated in the exordium, might be expected to be referred to in the proof. But this is hardly to the point. The writer has now begun his argument from the Old Testament, and is engaged in showing the idea involved in the term Son as applied therein to the Messiah. This, therefore, and not what he has said previously, is what we have to regard in our interpretation; and the most obvious view of the phrase, as it occurs in the psalm itself, is to regard it as a figure denoting forcibly the <span class="accented">paternity</span> of God; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>, "They say to the wood, Thou art my father; to the stone, Thou hast begotten me." It <span class="accented">expresses</span> the idea that the "Son of God" spoken of derives his existence as such from him, and not from human ancestry. Chrysostom, among the ancients, understands the phrase as thus referring to the sonship assigned to the Messiah in time, and not to his eternal being. This view being taken, "this day," in reference to the king, may mean the day of the "decree," or that of his enthronement on Mount Zion. In reference to Christ it has been variously understood of the time of his incarnation, or resurrection, or ascension. If it be thought necessary to assign any definite time to it in its application to Christ, the view of its being the day of the resurrection is supported by such passages as <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: and <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> ... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: cf. <a href="/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a> and <a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a>, etc., "The promise that was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again: as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." This last text, be it observed, is almost conclusive against the eternal generation being understood as referred to; as is also the application of the same text <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="/hebrews/5-5.htm">Hebrews 5:5</a>, where it is quoted in proof of Christ's appointment to the eternal priesthood. [" The title of <span class="accented">begetting</span> is ofttimes in sacred language to be measured, not by the scale of philosophers' or naturalists' dialect, but of moral or civil language or interpretation. For they that are sons by adoption only, or next heirs by reversion to a crown or dignity, are said to be begotten of those which adopt them, or of whom they be the immediate heirs or successors: and in this sense in the sacred genealogy (<a href="/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a>) Jeconiah is said to have begotten Salathiel. So that David upon his own occasions (whether upon his anointing to the crown of Judah in Hebron, or of Israel in Zion) might in the literal sense avouch these words of himself, 'I will preach the law whereof the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee.' For David to call the day of his coronation, or of his designation to the crown of Judah, or of all Israel, his <span class="accented">birthday</span>, or <span class="accented">begetting of God</span>, by whose special power and providence he was crowned, is not so harsh as some haply would deem it that either know not or consider not that it was usual in other states or kingdoms beside Judah to celebrate two <span class="accented">natales dies</span>, two solemn nativities or birthdays in honor of their kings and emperors: the one they called <span class="accented">diem natalem imperatoris</span>, the other <span class="accented">diem natalem imperii</span>; the one the birthday of the emperor when he was born of his natural mother, the other the birthday of him as he was emperor, which we call the <span class="accented">coronation day.</span> The reason might hold more peculiar in David than in any other princes, because he was the first of all the seed of Abraham that took possession of the hill of Zion, and settled the kingdom of Judah, prophesied of by his father Jacob, upon himself and his posterity Thus <span class="accented">Ego hodie genuite</span>, with submission of my opinion to better judgment, is a prediction typically prophetical, which kind of prediction, as hath been observed before, is the most concludent; and this one of the highest rank in that kind; that is, an oracle truly meant of David according to the literal sense, and yet fulfilled of Christ, the Son of God, by his resurrection from the dead, both according to the most exquisite literal and the mystical and principally intended sense" (T. Jackson's 'Works,' bk. 9. Hebrews 31:6, 7, Oxford edition, 1844, vol. 8. p. 411).] <span class="cmt_word">And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son</span> (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>); from Nathan's message to David, which has been spoken of above. The words do not in themselves express so unique a sonship as those used in the psalm; but, viewed in connection with the psalm, with their own context, and with subsequent prophecy, they suggest the same meaning. David had formed the design of building a temple; Nathan, by the word of the Lord, forbids his doing so, but tells him that his "seed" after him should build a house for the LORD'S Name, and that the Load would establish the throne of his kingdom for ever." Then comes the text," I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son;" followed by, "If he commit iniquity, I will chastise him with the rod of men ... but my mercy shall not depart away from him And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever." Now, there can be no doubt that there was a primary and partial fulfillment of this promise in Solomon, who built the temple after David's death. He took it to himself, so far as it was applicable to him, after his completion of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-17.htm">1 Kings 8:17</a>, etc.). But it is equally evident that its meaning could not be exhausted in him. The eternity assigned to the throne of the kingdom points to a distant as well as an immediate fulfillment, and the word translated "seed" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>), though applicable in a concrete sense to an individual offspring (cf. Gem 4:25; <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>), is properly a collective noun, denoting "posterity," and thus naturally lends itself to a far-reach ng together with other passages which have been referred to in connection with the second psalm. Thus we may properly apply to this particular passage the view of the meaning of prophecy which has been set forth in general terms above, according to which we must regard Solomon, with respect to the sonship assigned to him as well as to his kingdom and the house which he was to build, as but a type and imperfect realization of a grand ideal to be in due time fulfilled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
