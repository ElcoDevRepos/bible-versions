The author, traditionally believed to be Paul or another apostolic figure, seeks the support of the community through prayer, emphasizing the power and necessity of intercession. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, where the prayer of a righteous person is described as powerful and effective. The call for prayer also underscores the humility of the author, acknowledging the need for divine assistance and the support of fellow believers.<p><b>we are convinced that we have a clear conscience</b><br>The mention of a "clear conscience" suggests a life lived in accordance with God's will and moral standards. In the context of Hebrews, this may relate to the author's teachings and actions being aligned with the truth of the Gospel. The concept of conscience is significant in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>, where Paul speaks of striving to maintain a clear conscience before God and man. This phrase indicates the author's confidence in their integrity and faithfulness to their calling.<p><b>and desire to live honorably in every way.</b><br>The aspiration to live honorably reflects the ethical and moral standards expected of believers. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching on holiness and righteous living, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, which calls Christians to be holy in all their conduct. The phrase suggests a commitment to living in a manner that is pleasing to God and a witness to others, embodying the teachings of Christ. The emphasis on "every way" indicates a comprehensive approach to integrity, covering all aspects of life, and serves as a model for Christian conduct.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is debated.
