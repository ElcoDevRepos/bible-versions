This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that the Holy Spirit guides believers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). The Spirit's role as a testifier underscores the continuity of God's revelation from the Old Testament to the New Testament, affirming the unity of Scripture. The use of "testifies" suggests a legal or formal declaration, indicating the seriousness and reliability of the message being conveyed.<p><b>First He says:</b><br>This phrase introduces a direct quotation, indicating that what follows is a specific, authoritative statement from God. The use of "First" suggests a sequence or order, implying that there is a structured revelation being presented.

The apodosis to "after that he hath said," not distinctly marked in the Greek or in the A.V., is denoted in the above rendering by "<span class="accented">then saith he"</span> before ver. 17. Another view is that it begins earlier in the sentence, being introduced by "saith the Lord," which occurs in the quotation from Jeremiah. But this is improbable, since <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> words in the quotation itself could not well be intended to be understood as the quoter's own; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the quotation down to ver. 17 is continuous, whereas the citation of ver. 17 is in the original passage of Jeremiah separated from the preceding one; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the logical conclusion intended to be drawn requires ver. 17 to be the apodosis. For the writer's purpose in referring once more to Jeremiah's prediction of the" new covenant" is to show from it the completeness and finality of Christ's atonement; and this, he argues, follows from this characteristic of the "new covenant" being added to the previous description of it - "Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." CH. 10:19-END. HORTATORY PORTION OF THE EPISTLE. The great doctrine of Christ's eternal priesthood having been led up to, established by argument, and at length fully expounded, it remains only to press the practical result of a belief in it in alternate tones of encouragement and of warning. We have seen that, even in the earlier chapters, hortatory passages were frequently interposed, showing the purpose all along in the writer's mind. In the central and deepest part of the argument (<a href="/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1-10:19</a>) there were none, close and uninterrupted attention to the course of thought being then demanded. But now, the argument being completed, the previous exhortations are taken up again, and enforced in consequently fuller and deeper tones. The connection of thought between these final admonitions and those previously interposed is evident when we compare the very expressions in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-23</a> with those in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>, and the warnings of <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>, etc., with those of <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc. Thus appears, as in other ways also, the carefully arranged plan of the Epistle, different in this respect from the undoubted Epistles of St. Paul, in which the thoughts generally follow each other without great regard to artistic arrangement. This, however, is in itself by no means conclusive against St. Paul's authorship, since there would be likely to be just this difference between a set treatise composed for a purpose, and a letter written <span class="accented">currente calamo</span> by the same author. It does, however, mark a different class of composition, and is suggestive, as far as it goes, of a different writer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/10-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
