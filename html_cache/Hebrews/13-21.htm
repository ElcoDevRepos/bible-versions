The concept of being "equipped" suggests preparation and readiness, akin to how soldiers are outfitted for battle (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>). The "good thing" refers to spiritual gifts and resources necessary for living a godly life (<a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a>). Doing "His will" aligns with the Lord's Prayer, where Jesus teaches to pray for God's will to be done on earth as it is in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>). This reflects a life of obedience and submission to God's plans, reminiscent of Jesus' own submission to the Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<p><b>And may He accomplish in us what is pleasing in His sight</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's active role in sanctification. The idea of God accomplishing His work in believers is echoed in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, where Paul expresses confidence that God will complete the good work He began. "Pleasing in His sight" suggests living in a way that aligns with God's standards, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>, where believers are urged to offer themselves as living sacrifices. This phrase underscores the transformation process, where believers are conformed to the image of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>).<p><b>through Jesus Christ</b><br>Jesus is the mediator through whom God's work is accomplished in believers. This reflects the centrality of Christ in the New Covenant, as He is the High Priest who intercedes for us (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The phrase underscores the necessity of Christ's role in salvation and sanctification, as He is the vine and believers are the branches, apart from whom they can do nothing (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>). It also points to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, who would bring about a new covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><b>to whom be glory forever and ever</b><br>This doxology attributes eternal glory to Jesus Christ, affirming His divine nature and eternal reign. The phrase is a common conclusion in New Testament writings, emphasizing the perpetual worship and honor due to Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>). It reflects the ultimate purpose of all creation, which is to glorify God (<a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>). This eternal perspective encourages believers to live with a focus on God's glory, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>.<p><b>Amen</b><br>"Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," used to affirm the truthfulness of a statement. It is a common conclusion to prayers and doxologies, signifying agreement and certainty. In the context of this verse, it serves as a final affirmation of the prayerful desires expressed, echoing the use of "Amen" in other scriptural prayers and blessings (<a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the one through whom God accomplishes His will in us.

Our role is to yield to His equipping, trust His ongoing action, abide in Christ, and join the eternal chorus of praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Make you perfect.</span>--To "make perfect" is the translation of two different words in this Epistle. In the one, which is of frequent occurrence (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-23.htm" title="To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,">Hebrews 12:23</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>"perfect" stands contrasted with that which is immature, which has not attained its end and aim. The other, which is used here (and in a somewhat different sense in <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a>), rather conveys the thought of completeness, complete equipment or preparation.<p><span class= "bld">Every good work.</span>--The best authorities read "every good thing;" and below, substitute "us" for "you." . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/13-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">equip</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(katartisai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Optative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2675.htm">Strong's 2675: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and a derivative of artios; to complete thoroughly, i.e. Repair or adjust.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
