Christ&#8217;s death activates the covenant and secures redemption from every breach of God&#8217;s law, past or present. The verse assures us that our salvation is rooted in Christ&#8217;s finished work, guaranteed by God&#8217;s promise, and results in eternal life with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And for this cause.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">And because of this.</span> This verse looks back to the great truth of <a href="/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>, which the last two verses have served to confirm and place in bolder relief. "Christ through His own blood entered once for all into the Holy Place, having won eternal redemption; and by reason of this He is the Mediator of a covenant, a new covenant, in order that they who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance." For "the new testament" we must certainly read <span class= "ital">a new covenant:</span> whatever may be thought of the following group of verses, the rendering <span class= "ital">testament</span> has no place here. The leading thought of Hebrews 8 is the establishment of a new covenant, and the former covenant has been referred to three times in this very chapter (<a href="/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That by means of death.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">that, death having taken place for redemption from the transgressions, &c.</span> The first covenant had been broken by "transgressions:" unless there be redemption from these--that is, from the bondage of penalty which has resulted from these--there can be no promise and no new covenant. In respect of this bondage, this penalty, the death of Christ was a ransom--an offering to God looked at in the light of a payment in the place of debt, service, or penalty due. When debt and payment are changed into the corresponding ideas of sin and punishment, the <span class= "ital">ransom</span> gives place to the <span class= "ital">sin-offering, </span>of which the principle was the acknowledgment of death deserved, and the vicarious suffering of death. So far our thought has rested on the removal of the results of the past. The covenant and the promise relate to the establishment of the better future. Death was necessary alike for both. The offering of Christ's life (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>) was a ransom or an offering for sin; it was also a sacrifice inaugurating a new covenant, which contained the promise of the eternal inheritance. See <a href="/context/hebrews/9-16.htm" title="For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.">Hebrews 9:16-18</a>; also <a href="/context/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13-14</a>, where the thought is very similar. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And for this cause he is the Mediator of a new testament, that by means of death</span> (literally, <span class="accented">death having taken place</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</span> Here the view of the gospel as a new <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> (introduced first in <a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, and enlarged on in <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>) is again brought in. For the word is still <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, though here, for reasons that will appear, rendered "testament" in the A.V. The connecting thought here is - It is <span class="accented">because</span> of Christ's sacrifice having been such as has been described, that he is the Mediator of that new and better covenant; it qualified him for being so. A sacrifice, a death, was required for giving it validity (vers. 16-23), and the <span class="accented">character</span> of his sacrifice implies a <span class="accented">better</span> covenant than the old, even such a one as Jeremiah foretold. Further, the purpose of his death is said to be "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant." For in the passage of Jeremiah the defect of the first covenant was based on the transgression of its conditions by man, while under the new one, such transgressions were to be no more remembered. But this could not be without atonement for them; the whole ceremonial of the Law signified this; and also that such atonement could not be except by death. The death of Christ satisfied this requirement; and so the new covenant could come in. So far the course of thought is clear. Nor is there difficulty in understanding the purport of ver. 18, etc., taken by itself, where the "blood-shedding" that inaugurated the first covenant is regarded as typical of that of Christ in the inauguration of the new one. But there is a difficulty about the intervening verses (16, 17), arising from the apparent use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> in a new sense, not otherwise suggested - that of <span class="accented">testament</span> rather than <span class="accented">covenant.</span> The verses are, as given in the A.V., <span class="cmt_word">For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. a word of which the exact meaning is not clear; some interpret "be brought in, or proved," some "be understood, implied ") <span class="cmt_word">the death of the testator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, equivalent to "him that made it"). <span class="cmt_word">For a testament is of force after men are dead</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>): <span class="cmt_word">otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth</span> (or, <span class="accented">for doth it ever avail while he theft made it liveth?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>; <a href="/john/7-26.htm">John 7:26</a>; <a href="/luke/3-15.htm">Luke 3:15</a>). Now, the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> itself undoubtedly may bear the sense of "testament." Its general meaning is " disposition," or "settlement;" and it may denote either compact between living persons, or a will to take effect after the testator's death. In the verses before us it <span class="accented">appears</span> to be used specifically in the latter sense. For they express general propositions, which are <span class="accented">not</span> true of all covenants, but <span class="accented">are</span> true (according to their most obvious sense) of all testaments. Further, this sense is distinctly applicable to the <span class="accented">new</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, regarded as the dying Christ's bequest to his Church. Hence, but for the context, we should naturally so understand it in these verses. The difficulties attending this sense are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word is not used in this specific sense before or afterwards in this Epistle or in <a href="/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>, which is the basis of the whole argument, or elsewhere, apparently, either in the Old Testament or the New. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sense does not suit the case of the <span class="accented">old</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, which was a covenant between the living God and his people; and there is no intimation of two senses being intended in the two cases: indeed, in the passage before us, the same sense seems to be distinctly implied, since the blood-shedding which inaugurated the old is at once (in ver. 17) spoken of as answering to the death which inaugurated the new, as though death inaugurated both in the same sense. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The word, in the sense of <span class="accented">covenant</span> (equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span>), is common in the LXX., expressing an idea familiar to Jews and Jewish Christians, while testamentary dispositions were, as far as we know, unfamiliar to the Hebrews; and, though the Roman testamentary law may have come into use when the Epistle was written, it is thought unlikely that the writer, addressing Hebrews, would have referred to it in illustration of a Divine dispensation, or, if he had, have used a word so well known to them in its traditional sense.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Christ] is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
