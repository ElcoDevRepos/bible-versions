This phrase serves as a transition, softening the previous admonitions. The use of "we" indicates a shared understanding and concern among the early Christian community. The context is a pastoral one, where the author seeks to encourage rather than condemn.<p><b>beloved</b><br>This term of endearment reflects the deep affection and pastoral care the author has for the recipients. It underscores the relational aspect of the letter, emphasizing that the warnings are given out of love. The use of "beloved" is consistent with other New Testament writings, such as in 1 <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7</a>, where believers are reminded of their identity in Christ and the love that should characterize their community.<p><b>we are convinced of better things in your case</b><br>The author expresses confidence in the spiritual maturity and potential of the recipients. This assurance contrasts with the earlier warnings and suggests that the author believes the audience will persevere in faith. The phrase "better things" implies a hopeful expectation of growth and fruitfulness, aligning with the biblical theme of sanctification and spiritual progress found in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>.<p><b>things that accompany salvation</b><br>This phrase highlights the evidence of genuine faith, which includes spiritual growth, good works, and perseverance. The "things" refer to the fruits of the Spirit and the transformation that occurs in a believer's life, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. Theologically, this underscores the concept that salvation is not merely a one-time event but a process that involves ongoing transformation and evidence of faith, as also discussed in <a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

implying church leaders stand together in this conviction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Better things</b><p>- &#8220;Better&#8221; is a recurring theme in Hebrews (e.g., a better hope, <a href="/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a>; a better covenant, 8:6).<p>- Here it contrasts the barren field of verse 8 with a fruitful field.<p>- The writer expects spiritual progress&#8212;evidence that grace is active, like the &#8220;better resurrection&#8221; in <a href="/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In your case</b><p>- Personal application keeps the message relational, not abstract.<p>- Each congregation must examine itself (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>), yet leaders can still encourage specific believers they know.<p>- This complements Paul&#8217;s confidence in the Thessalonians&#8217;
