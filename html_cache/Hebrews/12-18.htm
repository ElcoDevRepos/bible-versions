Mount Sinai, where the Law was given, was a physical location that the Israelites could approach but not touch due to its holiness and the presence of God. This serves as a reminder of the Old Covenant, which was based on physical laws and rituals. The emphasis here is on the tangible nature of the Old Covenant, which required physical adherence and was marked by fear and distance from God.<p><b>and that is burning with fire</b><br>The fire on Mount Sinai symbolizes God's holiness and consuming presence. In <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, the mountain is described as being covered in smoke because the Lord descended on it in fire. This imagery conveys the awe and fear associated with God's presence under the Old Covenant. Fire often represents God's judgment and purification, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, which describes God as a consuming fire. This highlights the severity and unapproachability of God under the Old Covenant.<p><b>to darkness, gloom, and storm</b><br>These elements further describe the terrifying and awe-inspiring scene at Mount Sinai. Darkness and gloom signify the obscurity and mystery of God's presence, as well as the fear it instilled in the Israelites. The storm represents the power and majesty of God, as well as the chaos and unpredictability of His presence. This imagery is consistent with the theophany at Sinai, where the people trembled at the sound of thunder and the sight of lightning (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). It underscores the contrast between the Old Covenant, characterized by fear and distance, and the New Covenant, which offers access and intimacy with God through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain referenced in this verse, where God gave the Law to Moses.

Had this word been in the sentence as originally written, its absence from all our more ancient authorities would be inexplicable; whilst, on the other hand, the contrast with <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>, and the recollection of <a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm" title="And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the middle of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>, from which the last words in this verse are taken, would very naturally lead a transcriber to supply this word, which he might suppose to have accidentally dropped out of the text. If, however, the writer did not make use of the word here, though the contrast of <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a> was already before his mind, it seems certain that the word was not in his thought; and hence we have no right to introduce it in the explanation of the verse. The true translation, in all probability, is as follows: <span class= "ital">For ye are not come unto a material</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">a palpable</span>)<span class= "ital"> and kindled fire, and unto gloom and darkness and tempest.</span> The object of the writer is to set forth the terrors which accompanied the giving of the Law,--that which the awe-stricken people saw and heard. Not the mount, but the terrible fire was that which met their gaze. Thus again and again in Deuteronomy we find reference to the voice and the fire alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-33.htm" title="Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?">Deuteronomy 4:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-36.htm" title="Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he showed you his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.">Deuteronomy 4:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-4.htm" title="The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the middle of the fire,">Deuteronomy 5:4</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/5-25.htm" title="Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.">Deuteronomy 5:25-26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-16.htm" title="According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>). Shortly before "the day of the assembly" in Horeb Israel had been led by "a pillar of fire" (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>); in <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm" title="For our God is a consuming fire.">Hebrews 12:29</a> of this chapter the figure of "a consuming fire" is applied to God Himself. To avoid such associations as these, and vividly to represent what then was shown to the Israelites, he speaks of "a material and kindled fire." The metaphor in "palpable" as applied to fire is hardly more remarkable than that involved in "a darkness which may be felt" (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.">Exodus 10:21</a>, where the word used in the LXX. is almost the same as that which we have here). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-29.</span> - There follows now, both for encouragement and for warning, a grand contrast between the Mosaic and Christian dispensations, founded on the phenomena that accompanied the giving of the Law. To Mount Sinai, with its repelling terrors, is opposed an ideal picture of Mount Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem, expressive of the communion of saints in Christ. And then at ver. 25 (as previously in <a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10</a>.) the tone of encouragement changes again to one of warning, the very excess of privilege being made the measure of the guilt of slighting it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned, with fire, and unto blackness and darkness and tempest.</span> The allusion is to the Israelites approaching Mount Sinai when the Law was given (see <a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>, whence still more than from <a href="/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>. the whole description is taken, "And ye came near [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, the same word as is used supra, <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>], and stood under the mountain"). Though the word "mount" in the Received Text has the support of no ancient authority, it must be understood, whether or not originally written. For it comes after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in the passage of Deuteronomy which is evidently referred to, the following words, "blackness, darkness, tempest" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>), being also found there. And otherwise we should have to translate, "a touched [i.e. palpable] and kindled fire;" but "touched" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>) is not suitable to <span class="accented">fire</span>; and we should also lose the evidently intended contrast between the two mountains of Sinai and Zion, which appears in ver. 22. Neither may we trans- late, as some would do, "a mountain that might be touched, and kindled fire;" for the original passage in Deuteronomy has "and the mountain burned with fire (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>)." The participle <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> (literally, that was touched), rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, may be used here, although on the occasion referred to all were forbidden to touch the mountain, by way of bringing more distinctly into view the actual Sinai, which was touched at other times, and which Moses both touched and ascended. If so, the main purpose of the word is to contrast the local and palpable mountain of the Law with the ideal Mount Zion which is afterwards spoken cf. Or, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> may here carry with it its common sense of groping after, as in the dark (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), with reference to the cloudy darkness about Sinai, and in contrast with the clear unclouded vision of Zion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
