In the context of Hebrews, Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate High Priest who has made the final atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16, 7</a>:23-28). The use of "therefore" connects this exhortation to the preceding discussions about Jesus' sacrifice and priesthood, underscoring that it is only through Him that believers can approach God (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>let us continually offer to God</b><br>The call to "continually offer" suggests a lifestyle of worship and devotion, not limited to specific times or places. This reflects the shift from the Old Testament sacrificial system, which required repeated animal sacrifices, to a New Covenant where spiritual sacrifices are ongoing (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The idea of continual offering aligns with the priestly role of believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5, 9</a>), who are called to live lives of worship.<p><b>a sacrifice of praise,</b><br>In the Old Testament, sacrifices were central to worship, but here, praise is described as a sacrifice. This indicates that praise is a valuable offering to God, requiring intentionality and sometimes personal cost, especially in difficult circumstances (<a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14, 23</a>). The concept of praise as a sacrifice highlights the heart's posture over ritualistic practices, aligning with God's desire for genuine worship (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>the fruit of lips</b><br>This metaphorical language draws from agricultural imagery, suggesting that praise is the natural product of a life rooted in Christ. Just as fruit is evidence of a healthy tree, so is praise evidence of a heart transformed by the Gospel (<a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-20</a>). This phrase also echoes <a href="/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>, where repentance and praise are likened to the fruit of the lips, emphasizing the verbal expression of faith.<p><b>that confess His name.</b><br>Confession of Jesus' name is a public declaration of allegiance and faith in Him. In the early church, this confession often came with persecution, making it a true test of faith (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>). The name of Jesus carries authority and power (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>), and confessing it is both an act of worship and a witness to the world. This confession aligns believers with the mission of proclaiming the Gospel (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the verse, Jesus is the mediator through whom believers offer their sacrifices of praise to God.

Praise, O you servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.">Psalm 113:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Through him therefore let us offer the sacrifice</span> (or, <span class="accented">a sacrifice</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips confessing to his Name.</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> is the designation in the ritual of the Law of the voluntary peace offering, offered by individuals on occasions calling for special thanksgiving (<a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>). In the psalms it is used to express generally praise and thanksgiving (see <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>:14, 23; 116:17. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, etc.). In virtue of their participation in the true and complete Sin Offering, Christians may fulfill this part of the ancient symbolism, not occasionally, but "continually;" bringing to God, not fruits of the earth, but the "fruit of the lips" (an expression found in <a href="/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>, where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> continual praise, springing from thankful hearts. In the Eucharist especially (hence so called) such sacrifice is continually offered, over the one atoning Sacrifice which is pleaded and partaken cf. But not in communions only, but ever in their daily lives, such "sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving" is due. But, as the next verse reminds the readers, the "<span class="accented">knit</span> of the lips" is not enough; there is a further sacrifice of our own, whereby we must show that we are true partakers of Christ, and truly thankful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/13-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(Di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
