The Greek word used here, "hypomon&#275;," implies endurance and patience under trial. This concept is echoed in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, where perseverance under trial is linked to receiving the crown of life. The early Christian community faced persecution and hardship, making perseverance a vital quality for maintaining faith. The call to persevere is not just about enduring difficulties but also about remaining faithful to the teachings and example of Jesus Christ.<p><b>so that after you have done the will of God</b><br>Doing the will of God involves obedience and alignment with His purposes. In the context of Hebrews, this includes holding fast to the confession of faith in Jesus Christ and living according to His teachings. The will of God is often associated with moral and ethical living, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, where believers are urged to be transformed by the renewing of their minds to discern God's will. The phrase suggests that perseverance is linked to active participation in God's plan, not merely passive endurance.<p><b>you will receive what He has promised</b><br>The promise referred to here is the ultimate reward of eternal life and salvation, a central theme in Christian eschatology. This promise is rooted in the covenantal relationship between God and His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the promises made to Abraham. In the New Testament, this promise is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the mediator of a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>). The assurance of receiving God's promise is contingent upon faithfulness and perseverance, as highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, which recounts the faith of the patriarchs who awaited the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.
