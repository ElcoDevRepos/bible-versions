The priests, descendants of Levi, were responsible for temple sacrifices and rituals. However, the term "perfection" here implies a complete, unblemished relationship with God, which the Levitical system could not achieve. The sacrifices were temporary and needed repetition, highlighting their insufficiency in providing ultimate redemption or spiritual completeness.<p><b>(for on this basis the people received the law)</b><br>The law given to Israel was intertwined with the Levitical priesthood. The priests were mediators of the law, teaching and enforcing it. The law served as a guide to holiness and a means to maintain covenant relationship with God. However, it also revealed human sinfulness and the need for a more profound solution, as it could not change the heart or provide eternal salvation.<p><b>why was there still need for another priest to appear&#8212;</b><br>The need for another priest suggests the inadequacy of the Levitical system. This points to a divine plan for a superior priesthood. The appearance of another priest indicates a shift in the divine order, fulfilling a deeper purpose in God's redemptive history. This new priesthood would address the limitations of the old covenant and offer a more complete means of reconciliation with God.<p><b>one in the order of Melchizedek</b><br>Melchizedek, a mysterious figure from <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>, was both a king and priest, predating the Levitical priesthood. His order is eternal and not based on lineage, unlike the Aaronic priesthood. <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> prophesies a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek, pointing to a messianic figure who would embody both kingly and priestly roles, offering a perfect and eternal priesthood.<p><b>and not in the order of Aaron?</b><br>The Aaronic priesthood, established through Aaron, Moses' brother, was hereditary and limited to the tribe of Levi. It was bound by the law and its rituals. The contrast with Melchizedek's order highlights the temporary and imperfect nature of the Aaronic priesthood. The new priesthood, in the order of Melchizedek, signifies a transformative shift, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers a perfect, eternal mediation between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_priesthood.htm">Levitical Priesthood</a></b><br>This refers to the priestly system established under the Law of Moses, where the descendants of Levi, particularly Aaron, served as priests.

Levitical priests offered sacrifices day after day (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1&#8211;7</a>), yet none of those offerings wiped sin away permanently (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>). Perfection&#8212;complete reconciliation with God&#8212;remained out of reach (<a href="/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a>). Paul echoes this when he says, &#8220;by works of the law no flesh will be justified&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). The sacrifices could cover sin temporarily, point to holiness, and teach the seriousness of disobedience (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), but they could never make a worshiper perfect in conscience or grant final access into God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>(for on this basis the people received the law)</b><p>The entire Mosaic system depended on the Levitical priesthood.

The law and the priesthood were welded together; without sacrifice the law offered only condemnation (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-9</a>). Hebrews reminds us that the law could show sin but not remove it (<a href="/hebrews/10-3.htm">Hebrews 10:3</a>).

If Aaron&#8217;s line could finish the work, God would not have spoken of someone else. The question stirs reflection: why promise a future priest unless the present system was provisional? <a href="/hebrews/5-5.htm">Hebrews 5:5-10</a> answers: God appointed His Son, who &#8220;learned obedience through what He suffered,&#8221; to fulfill what the sons of Aaron could only symbolize.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one in the order of Melchizedek</b><p>Melchizedek steps briefly into <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a> as &#8220;king of Salem&#8221; and &#8220;priest of God Most High.&#8221; He blesses Abram, receives tithes, and then disappears, with no genealogy recorded. <a href="/hebrews/7-3.htm">Hebrews 7:3</a> uses that silence to picture a priesthood not bound by ancestry or succession&#8212;ideal for an eternal High Priest. <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> links Messiah to Melchizedek, signaling a royal priest whose ministry combines throne and altar forever.

This being so, how could this other priesthood take the place of the Levitical if this latter had answered its full purpose?<p><span class= "bld">Perfection.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the making perfect</span>--the full accomplishment of the essential aim of priesthood, in bringing men "near to God."<p><span class= "bld">Received.</span>--The better reading is <span class= "ital">hath received.</span>--The object of this parenthesis is to point out the intimate relation between the Law and the priesthood: "I speak of the Levitical priesthood, for it is on the basis of this that the Law given to the people rests."<p><span class= "bld">Another priest.</span>--That is (as the Greek implies), <span class= "ital">a priest of a different kind</span> (<a href="/hebrews/7-13.htm" title="For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.">Hebrews 7:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-15.htm" title="And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there rises another priest,">Hebrews 7:15</a>). The question is equivalent to a strong denial: there could be no such need.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If then perfection</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: cf. <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>were through the Levitical priesthood</span> <span class="cmt_word">for under it</span> (rather, <span class="accented">upon it, on the ground of it</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the people hath received the Law), what need was there that another</span> (rather, <span class="accented">a different</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron.</span> <span class="cmt_word">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the Law.</span> Here a further thought is introduced. So far the superiority of the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek to the Aaronic has been shown. The new thought is that the very mention in the psalm of a different order of priesthood implies that the old order, and with it the whole legal dispensation which depended on it, was imperfect and to be superseded. This is the general drift of vers. 11, 12, though the sequence of thought in their several clauses is not easy to follow. Ideas in the writer's mind, not expressed, seem necessary to be understood. In the parenthetical clause of ver. 11, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are decidedly to be preferred, on the ground of authority, to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> of the Textus Receptus. 'The meaning of the clause (whatever be the precise thought connecting it with the sentence in which it stands) is that the whole Law rested on the institution of the priesthood; not the priests only, but the whole people (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), received their Law as grounded on it. On the same idea depends ver. 12, where it is said that a change of the priesthood involves of necessity a change of the Law. The verses next following serve to remove all doubt that there <span class="accented">is</span> a complete change of the priesthood; the proofs being, not only the patent fact that the Messiah is of the tribe, not of Levi, but of Judah (vers. 13, 14), but also, for mere abundant evidence of the Divine purpose, that significant utterance, again adduced, about his being after the order, not of Aaron, but of Melchizedek (vers. 15, 16, 17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/7-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
