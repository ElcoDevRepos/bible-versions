This suggests a deep and complex understanding of the subject at hand, likely referring to the priesthood of Christ in the order of Melchizedek, as discussed in the surrounding passages. This priesthood is a significant theme in Hebrews, connecting Jesus to Old Testament figures and prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, which speaks of a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.<p><b>but it is hard to explain</b><br>The difficulty in explanation is not due to the complexity of the subject alone but also the spiritual maturity of the audience. The author is addressing believers who should be advancing in their understanding of spiritual truths. This reflects a common theme in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to grow in knowledge and maturity, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1-2</a> and <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-15</a>.<p><b>because you are dull of hearing</b><br>"Dull of hearing" implies a spiritual sluggishness or lack of receptivity to deeper truths. This condition is not due to a physical inability but a spiritual one, where the audience has become complacent or resistant to further teaching. This echoes the warnings found in other parts of Hebrews, such as <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-8</a>, which cautions against hardening one's heart. The cultural context of the time, with pressures from both Jewish and pagan influences, may have contributed to this spiritual dullness, as believers struggled to maintain their faith amidst external challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

He is entering on a new theme, higher and less level to the comprehension of his readers than any that has gone before. Even so far, we have seen how their Jewish prejudices had evoked admonitions, frequently interposed in the course of the argument. Much more so now, when it is to be shown how the priesthood of Christ not only fulfils the idea of, but also supersedes, that of the sons of Aaron, being of a different order from theirs. The region of thought to be entered now, being that of "<span class="accented">the</span> mystery of Christ," transcends more than any that has been so far entered the ordinary conceptions of traditional Judaism. Hence the writer's shrinking from entering all at once on the subject for fear of not being even understood; hence his earnest warnings to his readers as to the necessity of advancing to the state of full-grown Christians who can discern spiritual things. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11</span> - <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm">Hebrews 6:20</a>. - INTERPOSED EXHORTATION. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of whom</span> (the most obvious antecedent being Melchizedek, but with regard to his typical significance, as referred to in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">we have many things to say</span> (the subject itself admits a lengthy exposition) and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become (not, as in A.V., "ye are") dull of hearing, Their dullness is the reason of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It was not that the subject was in itself inexplicable, or that the writer was incompetent to explain it; his difficulty was in adapting the interpretation to the capacity of his readers: "Non scribentis, sed vestro vitio" (Bengel). It seems from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("ye are become"), in this and the following verse, that the Hebrew Christians had even retrograded in spiritual perception. This is easily conceivable. As, through the teaching of St. Paul especially, the tie between Christianity and Judaism became more and more broken, there was likely to be a certain reaction among the Hebrew Christians, who, having gone to a certain extent with the tide of thought, became conscious how far it was carrying them. They would be inclined to cling the more fondly to their old associations from the fear of losing them altogether. Such retrogressions have been observable in other times of upheaval of old ideas. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/5-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We [have]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;min)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
