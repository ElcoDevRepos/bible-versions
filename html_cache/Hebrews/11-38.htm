These individuals, including prophets and martyrs, lived lives of such faith and righteousness that the sinful world could not appreciate or deserve them. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>, where He states that His followers are not of the world. The world, in its fallen state, often fails to recognize the worth of those who live by faith, as seen in the persecution of prophets like Elijah and Jeremiah. Their lives point to the ultimate worthiness of Christ, who was also rejected by the world.<p><b>They wandered in deserts and mountains,</b><br>This phrase reflects the physical hardships endured by the faithful. The deserts and mountains symbolize places of isolation and trial, reminiscent of the Israelites' 40 years in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>) and Elijah's flight to Mount Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8-9</a>). These locations often served as places of testing and divine encounter, where God provided sustenance and revelation. The wandering also signifies a life of pilgrimage, as believers seek a heavenly homeland (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>), paralleling the journey of faith that all Christians undertake.<p><b>and hid in caves and holes in the ground.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the persecution and danger faced by the faithful. Caves and holes were often used as places of refuge, as seen in the life of David when he fled from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>) and the prophets who hid from Jezebel (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>). Archaeological findings in regions like Qumran, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, provide evidence of such hiding places. This imagery also foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who had "nowhere to lay his head" (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>), and serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship in a hostile world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful_heroes.htm">The Faithful Heroes</a></b><br>This verse refers to the faithful individuals mentioned throughout <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, often called the "Hall of Faith." These are people who demonstrated unwavering faith in God despite severe trials and persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/deserts_and_mountains.htm">Deserts and Mountains</a></b><br>These geographical locations symbolize the harsh and isolated conditions in which these faithful individuals lived. They often had to flee to such places to escape persecution and remain true to their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/caves_and_holes_in_the_ground.htm">Caves and Holes in the Ground</a></b><br>These were places of refuge and hiding for the faithful.

When verse 38 declares, &#8220;The world was not worthy of them&#8221;, it elevates heaven&#8217;s assessment above earth&#8217;s acclaim.<p>&#8226; Scripture often contrasts worldly values with God&#8217;s values. Jesus said, &#8220;What is exalted among men is an abomination before God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/16-15.htm">Luke 16:15</a>). Paul reminds us that &#8220;God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; These saints lived by faith, not by the applause of society. Just as the world did not recognize Christ (<a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>), it could not properly value His faithful people (<a href="/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Their lives testify that true worth is measured by obedience to God, not by comfort, popularity, or power (<a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>). One day, those who followed Christ in faith will &#8220;judge the world&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2</a>), confirming heaven&#8217;s verdict that the present age was unworthy of them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They wandered in deserts and mountains</b><p>&#8226; Faith led many believers away from secure, predictable settings. David fled to the wilderness of Ziph (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). Elijah trekked forty days to Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>). Israel spent forty years in desert places (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Wandering underscores pilgrim living. &#8220;Here we do not have a permanent city, but we are looking for the city that is to come&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-14.htm">Hebrews 13:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God often met His servants in lonely regions. Moses encountered the burning bush in Midian (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1-2</a>). John received Revelation on the rocky isle of Patmos (<a href="/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Isolation did not mean abandonment. In barren spaces the Lord provided manna (<a href="/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a>), ravens (<a href="/1_kings/17-6.htm">1 Kings 17:6</a>), and angelic strength (<a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>). Such accounts encourage us that God sustains faith even when geography is harsh and resources are scarce (<a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and hid in caves and holes in the ground</b><p>&#8226; Persecution drove many saints underground&#8212;literally. Gideon threshed wheat in a winepress to hide from Midianite raiders (<a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2, 11</a>). Obadiah concealed a hundred prophets in two caves (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>). David sought refuge in Adullam&#8217;s cave (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Caves and earth&#8217;s crevices symbolize both human frailty and divine protection. Elijah heard God&#8217;s gentle whisper while sheltering in a cave on Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9-13</a>).<p>&#8226; New-covenant believers also scattered under threat. After Stephen&#8217;s martyrdom, &#8220;all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>). Yet the gospel advanced (<a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a>), proving that forced seclusion cannot stifle God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Today&#8217;s believers may not flee to literal caves, but they may face social marginalization or legal opposition. Hebrews points us to those who endured worse, assuring us that God&#8217;s presence reaches into every hiding place (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/11-38.htm">Hebrews 11:38</a> crowns the faith-heroes&#8217; story by contrasting their heaven-assigned worth with the world&#8217;s rejection. Whether wandering through desolate landscapes or crouching in caves, they remained steadfast, proving that God&#8217;s approval outweighs earthly comfort. Their example urges us to value what God values, to persevere when faith disrupts our security, and to remember that any hardship endured for Christ will one day be answered with glory far beyond this world&#8217;s ability to measure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
