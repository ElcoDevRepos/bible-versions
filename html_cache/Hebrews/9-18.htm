It serves as a conclusion to the argument that blood is essential for the establishment of covenants, drawing from the broader context of the sacrificial system outlined in the Old Testament.<p><b>even the first covenant</b><br>The "first covenant" refers to the Mosaic Covenant, established between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai. This covenant included the Ten Commandments and various laws and ordinances. It was foundational for the Jewish faith and set the stage for the coming of the New Covenant through Jesus Christ. The Mosaic Covenant is detailed in <a href="/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19-24</a>.<p><b>was not put into effect</b><br>This indicates that the covenant required a formal enactment process. In the ancient Near Eastern context, covenants were often ratified through rituals, which frequently involved sacrifices. The enactment of the Mosaic Covenant involved a series of sacrifices and the sprinkling of blood, as described in <a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>.<p><b>without blood</b><br>Blood symbolizes life and is a critical element in the sacrificial system. In <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, it is stated that "the life of the flesh is in the blood," and it is given on the altar to make atonement for souls. The use of blood in the covenantal context signifies the seriousness of the agreement and the need for purification and atonement. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood established the New Covenant, as seen in <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a> and <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_first_covenant.htm">The First Covenant</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Covenant established between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai, which included the Law and the sacrificial system.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The mediator of the first covenant, who received the Law from God and instructed the Israelites in its observance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were bound by the first covenant and its requirements, including the sacrificial system.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where sacrifices were made under the first covenant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The system of offerings and sacrifices, including the shedding of blood, which was central to the first covenant and symbolized atonement for sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_blood_in_covenants.htm">The Necessity of Blood in Covenants</a></b><br>The shedding of blood was essential for the establishment of the first covenant, symbolizing purification and atonement.
