The term "disgrace for Christ" suggests a willingness to suffer for the sake of God's promises, which is a theme echoed throughout the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>). Although Moses lived long before Christ's earthly ministry, his actions prefigure the suffering servant motif found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and the New Testament understanding of sharing in Christ's sufferings (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). Moses' choice reflects a deep faith in God's redemptive plan, which ultimately culminates in Christ.<p><b>above the treasures of Egypt</b><br>Egypt was one of the wealthiest and most powerful nations of the ancient world, known for its opulence and grandeur. Moses, as a member of Pharaoh's household, had access to immense wealth and privilege. Choosing disgrace over these treasures signifies a profound act of faith and prioritization of spiritual over material wealth. This decision mirrors Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth. Moses' choice serves as a powerful example of faith and the eternal perspective that values spiritual inheritance over temporal gain.<p><b>for he was looking ahead to his reward</b><br>Moses' actions were motivated by a forward-looking faith, anticipating the fulfillment of God's promises. This reward is not merely earthly but eternal, aligning with the biblical theme of hope in God's future deliverance and blessing (<a href="/hebrews/10-35.htm">Hebrews 10:35-36</a>). The concept of reward is also seen in Jesus' teachings, such as in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>), where enduring persecution for righteousness' sake is linked to great reward in heaven. Moses' faith exemplifies the assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of things not seen, as described in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>. His life points to the ultimate reward found in Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

The first point to be noted is that the words are almost exactly a quotation from one of the chief of the Messianic Psalms (<a href="/context/psalms/89-50.htm" title="Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;">Psalm 89:50-51</a>)--"Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of many peoples: wherewith Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of Thine Anointed." Here the writer in effect speaks of himself as bearing "the reproach of the Anointed" of the Lord; pleading in his name and identifying himself with his cause. "The Anointed" is the king who (see the Note on <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>) was the type of the promised Christ. Throughout the whole of their history the people of Israel were the people of the Christ. Their national existence originated in the promise to Abraham, which was a promise of the Christ; and till the fulness of time should come their mission was to prepare the way for Him. The reproach which Moses accepted by joining the people of the promise was, therefore, "the reproach of the Christ," the type of that "reproach" which in later days His people will share with Him (<a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm" title="Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.">Hebrews 13:13</a>). He who was to appear in the last days as the Messiah was already in the midst of Israel (<a href="/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a>). (See <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm" title="For the zeal of your house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached you are fallen on me.">Psalm 69:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1Peter 1:11</a>; and the Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2Corinthians 1:5</a>. <a href="/context/philippians/3-7.htm" title="But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.">Philippians 3:7-11</a> furnishes a noble illustration of this whole record.) . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He valued</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#947;&#951;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;g&#275;samenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2233.htm">Strong's 2233: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) To lead, (b) To think, be of opinion, suppose, consider. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">disgrace</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8000;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oneidismon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3680.htm">Strong's 3680: </a> </span><span class="str2">Reproach, reviling.
