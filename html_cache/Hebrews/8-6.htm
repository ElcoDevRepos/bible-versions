The term "much more excellent" underscores the superiority of Christ's ministry. In the context of Hebrews, Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate High Priest, surpassing the earthly priests who served in the tabernacle. His ministry is not limited by the constraints of the earthly sanctuary but is heavenly and eternal. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which speak of a new covenant that would be established by God.<p><b>just as the covenant He mediates is better</b><br>The "covenant" refers to the new covenant prophesied in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ. Unlike the old covenant, which was based on the law given to Moses and required continual sacrifices for atonement, the new covenant offers a permanent solution to sin through the sacrifice of Jesus. This covenant is "better" because it provides a direct relationship with God, internalizes His laws in the hearts of believers, and offers complete forgiveness of sins. The role of Jesus as a mediator is crucial, as He bridges the gap between God and humanity, a role foreshadowed by figures like Moses and Aaron but perfected in Christ.<p><b>and is founded on better promises</b><br>The "better promises" refer to the assurances given under the new covenant, which include eternal life, a personal relationship with God, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. These promises are superior to those of the old covenant, which were conditional and often focused on earthly blessings and obedience to the law. The new covenant promises are unconditional and eternal, secured by the finished work of Christ on the cross. This reflects the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people. The assurance of these promises is rooted in the faithfulness of God, who cannot lie, making them a firm foundation for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is portrayed as the mediator of a new and superior covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_covenant.htm">The Old Covenant</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Covenant, which was based on the Law given to Moses on Mount Sinai.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_covenant.htm">The New Covenant</a></b><br>The covenant established through Jesus Christ, offering a more excellent ministry and better promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hebrews.htm">The Hebrews</a></b><br>The original audience of the letter, likely Jewish Christians who were familiar with the Old Covenant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain, the author seeks to demonstrate the superiority of Christ's ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_superiority_of_christ's_ministry.htm">The Superiority of Christ's Ministry</a></b><br>Jesus' ministry surpasses the old because it is based on grace and truth, not just the law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_better_covenant.htm">The Better Covenant</a></b><br>The New Covenant offers a direct relationship with God, internal transformation, and eternal promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_a_mediator.htm">The Role of a Mediator</a></b><br>Jesus as the mediator bridges the gap between God and humanity, offering reconciliation and peace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_foundation_of_better_promises.htm">The Foundation of Better Promises</a></b><br>The promises of the New Covenant include eternal life, forgiveness of sins, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_under_the_new_covenant.htm">Living Under the New Covenant</a></b><br>Believers are called to live in the freedom and power of the Spirit, reflecting the character of Christ in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_8_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 8:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_8_6_Jesus_as_better_covenant_mediator.htm">How does Hebrews 8:6 emphasize Jesus' role as mediator of a better covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_better_promises_daily.htm">What does "better promises" in Hebrews 8:6 mean for our daily Christian life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_a_superior_ministry.htm">How can we apply the concept of a "superior ministry" in our service?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_8_6_and_OT_covenant_link.htm">How does Hebrews 8:6 connect with Old Testament covenant promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Jesus_mediate_our_prayers.htm">In what ways can we rely on Jesus' mediation in our prayer life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_8_6_Christ_s_superior_ministry.htm">How does Hebrews 8:6 define the superiority of Christ's ministry over the old covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_8_6_on_Mosaic_Law_s_obsolescence.htm">What does Hebrews 8:6 imply about the obsolescence of the Mosaic Law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Heb_8_6_show_a_better_covenant.htm">How does Hebrews 8:6 support the concept of a better covenant through Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_hebrews_8.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Hebrews 8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_the_new_covenant_better_in_hebrews.htm">In Hebrews 8:6&#8211;7, how is the new covenant truly &#8220;better,&#8221; and why would God establish an &#8220;imperfect&#8221; first covenant in the first place?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_new_covenant_theology.htm">What defines New Covenant Theology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_bible's_testaments_mean.htm">What does dividing the Bible into Testaments mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_deuteronomy_14_8_ban_pork.htm">Deuteronomy 14:8 forbids eating pork, but it is consumed safely today.

(See <a href="/hebrews/8-3.htm" title="For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.">Hebrews 8:3</a>.) We have here another of those proportional statements commented on in <a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm" title="Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.">Hebrews 1:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.">Hebrews 3:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>. The last of these passages is closely akin to this. There we read that by how much the Priest appointed by the divine oath is raised above all other priests, by so much is His covenant better than theirs. Here, that as He is Mediator of a better covenant, in the same proportion does His ministry excel that of priests on earth.<p><span class= "bld">Which was established.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">one that hath been ordained.</span> The verb, properly meaning "to legislate," has already occurred in <a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>, "the people hath received the Law" (literally, <span class= "ital">hath been legislated for</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Here, then, a word which properly refers to the passing of a law is applied to a covenant. The explanation must be sought in the special nature of the covenants of God with man (see <a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>), which are not compacts between equals, but arrangements offered by the divine goodness, and made dependent upon conditions. Hence such a covenant may be spoken of as ordained, enacted, on the basis of promise. On the promises (see <a href="/context/hebrews/8-8.htm" title="For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:">Hebrews 8:8-12</a>) which are given by God is based the "covenant" which becomes the law of His kingdom and the declaration of His procedure. The man who accepts the promises by entering into the conditions laid down is dealt with according to this law. Here, Jesus is the "Mediator," in <a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a> (see Note) the "Surety," of the better covenant.

There the proved superior greatness of the predicted priest was made the measure of the superior excellence of the <span class="accented">covenant</span> of which he has become Surety; here the superior excellence of the new <span class="accented">covenant</span>, which is now to be shown from prophecy, is made /he measure of that of Christ's priestly ministry, which has just been proved to be of necessity in the sphere of heavenly realities of which the Mosaic ritual was but a copy and shadow. The word here used is not <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("surety"), as in <a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> ("mediator"); on which it is to be observed that the mediator of the old covenant was not Aaron, but Moses (see <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>): it was he that intervened between God and the congregation in the establishment of the covenant; and thus, in this respect also, the priesthood of the new covenant transcends the old one, in that (as was shown also in the earlier part of the Epistle) the type of Moses, as well as of Aaron, is fulfilled in it. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("established" in A.V.; "enacted" in the recent R.V.) expresses the promulgation of a <span class="accented">law - appositely</span> in the first place to the Law of Moses, which constituted the conditions of the old covenant; but also to the description of the new covenant, which follows from Jeremiah, according to which the <span class="accented">law</span> remains, but to be written on the heart. The gospel is elsewhere regarded under the idea of <span class="accented">law</span>, though not a law of bondage, but of liberty - a law, not of the letter, but of the Spirit (see <a href="/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>; <a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="/romans/9-31.htm">Romans 9:31</a>; <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>). The "better promises" are such as the passage from Jeremiah, quoted below, notably represents. Other passages might be referred to (such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 37:24, etc.), of similar significance, though not with the same marked mention of a new <span class="accented">covenant</span> to supersede the old one. This memorable passage (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-35</a>) occurs in a distinct section of Jeremiah's prophecies (30, 31.), delivered after the commencement of the Captivity, and directed to be written in a book. The subject of the whole section is the restoration of Israel, its ultimate Messianic reference being patent to all who acknowledge any such at all in prophecy. In evidence of this there is not only the passage before us, pointing to an entirely new covenant with Israel, and the ideal tone of the whole prophecy, but also, in particular, the view of all the scattered tribes, not Judah only - the whole ideal Israel - being gathered together from all countries to Zion, and of David himself to rule over them as king. The national and local framework, which the picture has in common with other prophetic visions of the coming days, is of course no difficulty to those familiar with the style of the prophetic books. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/8-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#925;&#965;&#957;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Nyni)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3570.htm">Strong's 3570: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of nun for emphasis; just now.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">however,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] has received</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#941;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(tetychen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5177.htm">Strong's 5177: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: I obtain, (b) absol: I chance, happen; ordinary, everyday, it may chance, perhaps. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a much</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#963;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(hos&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Dative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3745.htm">Strong's 3745: </a> </span><span class="str2">How much, how great, how many, as great as, as much.
