The concept of Jesus living forever is rooted in His resurrection, which is a cornerstone of Christian faith. This eternal life fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, which speaks of a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. The eternal life of Jesus signifies His divine nature and His victory over death, as seen in <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>, where He declares, "I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive forever and ever!"<p><b>He has a permanent priesthood</b><br>The permanence of Jesus' priesthood is a key theme in the book of Hebrews, highlighting the superiority of His priesthood over the temporary and repetitive nature of the Levitical priesthood. Unlike the priests of the Old Covenant, who had to offer sacrifices repeatedly and were replaced upon death, Jesus' priesthood is unchanging and eternal. This permanence is linked to His role as the mediator of a new and better covenant, as described in <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>. The concept of a permanent priesthood also connects to the typology of Melchizedek, who is presented as a figure without genealogy or end of days in <a href="/hebrews/7-3.htm">Hebrews 7:3</a>, symbolizing an eternal priesthood. Jesus' unending priesthood assures believers of a constant intercessor before God, as He continually advocates on their behalf, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is depicted as the eternal high priest.
