Mocking and flogging were common forms of persecution in ancient times, often used to humiliate and physically punish those who were seen as threats or dissenters. In the context of <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, this refers to the trials faced by the prophets and other faithful servants of God. The mocking can be seen in the treatment of figures like Jeremiah, who was ridiculed for his prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>). Flogging, a brutal form of punishment, was used by both Jewish and Roman authorities, as seen in the New Testament with the apostles (<a href="/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40</a>). This phrase underscores the physical and emotional suffering endured by those who remained steadfast in their faith.<p><b>and even chains and imprisonment</b><br>Chains and imprisonment were common consequences for those who defied the prevailing religious or political authorities. In the biblical narrative, Joseph was imprisoned in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20</a>), and the prophet Jeremiah was confined for his prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15-16</a>). In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul frequently faced imprisonment for preaching the gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-13.htm">Philippians 1:13</a>). These experiences of confinement serve as a testament to the perseverance and faithfulness of God's servants, who endured such hardships for the sake of their beliefs. The mention of chains and imprisonment in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a> serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the enduring hope that sustains believers through trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_and_martyrs.htm">Prophets and Martyrs</a></b><br>The verse refers to unnamed individuals who suffered for their faith.

By adding &#8220;Still others,&#8221; he widens the lens to include every unnamed believer who trusted God yet never saw earthly vindication. This matters because:<p>&#8226;God&#8217;s Hall of Faith is not reserved for the famous; every obedient believer counts (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226;Their stories remind us that faithfulness, not public recognition, is what pleases the Lord (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p>&#8226;They form part of the &#8220;great cloud of witnesses&#8221; that surrounds us (<a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>), urging us to run our own race with endurance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>endured mocking and flogging</b><p>The Spirit highlights the kind of hostility these saints faced: cruel words and physical abuse.

Such trials affirm, rather than negate, genuine faith (<a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and even chains and imprisonment</b><p>The phrase escalates the cost: some were locked away. Throughout Scripture:<p>&#8226;Joseph was unjustly jailed in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20</a>).<p>&#8226;Micaiah was thrown into prison for speaking truth (<a href="/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226;Jeremiah languished &#8220;in a vaulted cell&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226;Peter, John, Paul, and Silas all wore literal chains (<a href="/acts/4-3.htm">Acts 4:3</a>; 16:24; <a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<p>God does not promise exemption from prisons, but He does promise:<p>&#8211;His presence in the darkest cell (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>).<p>&#8211;The gospel&#8217;s unstoppable advance&#8212;&#8220;the word of God is not chained&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<p>&#8211;Eternal reward that far outweighs temporary bonds (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36</a> testifies that authentic faith may invite scorn, beatings, and jail, yet such hardships never nullify God&#8217;s faithfulness.

The same Lord who sustained the nameless saints of old now strengthens us to stand firm, confident that our present sufferings are preparing an everlasting glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) The language becomes more general, but still chiefly refers to the same troublous times.<p><span class= "bld">Yea, moreover of bonds.</span>--Lasting and cruel captivity, a worse fate even than "mockings and scourgings."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented</span> (rather, <span class="accented">evil-entreated</span>); (of whom the world was not worthy:) <span class="cmt_word">wandering in deserts, and mountains, and dens, and the eaves of the earth.</span> In this general review particular cases may again have suggested some of the expressions used. The mention of "mockings" is prominent in the Maccabean history; "bonds and imprisonments" recall Hanani, Micaiah, and Jeremiah; "they were stoned" recalls Zachariah son of Jehoiada (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>; cf. <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>; <a href="/luke/11-51.htm">Luke 11:51</a>; also <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>). "They wandered in sheepskins (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) and in deserts" peculiarly suggests Elijah (his mantle being called <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX., <a href="/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13, 14</a>), though the Maccabean heroes also took refuge in "deserts and mountains" (1 Macc. 2.). "Sawn asunder" (denoting a mode of executing martyrs of which there is no instance in the Old Testament or Apocrypha) most probably refers to a well-known tradition about Isaiah, who is said to have so suffered under Manasseh. Alford thus gives the notices found elsewhere of this tradition: "Justin Martyr 'Trypho,' &sect; 120; Tertullian, 'Cont. Guest. Scorpiac.,' 8, and 'De Patient.,' 14; Origen, Ep. ad African.;' Lactantius, 'Inst.,' 4:11; Ps-Epiphanius, 'Vit. Proph.; Augustine, 'De Civ. Dei,' 18:24; Jerome, on <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>." Jerome calls it a "certissima traditio apud Judaeos," and says that this passage in the Epistle was by most referred to the passion of Isaiah. The tameness and apparent inappropriateness of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> ("were tempted") in ver. 36, in the midst of an enumeration of cruel modes of death, has led to a prevalent view that it is a corruption of the original text. Various conjectures have been made, the most tenable being <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it is an interpolation, arising kern the repetition by some copyist of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, which was afterwards altered to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it is a substitution for some other word through error in transcription, the most likely conjecture as to the word originally written being <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "were burnt."

But, as there is no authority of any manuscript for a different word, this is mere conjecture; though the omission of the word altogether in some few manuscripts and versions, and variations of reading in others, suggest some uncertainty as to the original text. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> if genuine, may possibly have been suggested by alliteration, and by thought of the temptations to apostatize prominent in the account both of Eleazar and of the seven sons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Still]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">others</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(heteroi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2087.htm">Strong's 2087: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) of two: another, a second, (b) other, different, (c) one's neighbor.
