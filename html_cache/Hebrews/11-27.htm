This act of faith is rooted in his understanding of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Moses' decision to leave Egypt signifies a break from his past life of privilege in Pharaoh's court, aligning himself with the suffering of his people, the Israelites. This departure is a precursor to the Exodus, where Moses would later lead the Israelites out of slavery, fulfilling God's promise of deliverance. His faith is a model of trusting in God's unseen plan, even when it requires leaving behind security and comfort.<p><b>not fearing the king&#8217;s anger</b><br>Moses' lack of fear in the face of Pharaoh's wrath highlights his trust in God's protection and sovereignty. Pharaoh, as the ruler of Egypt, was considered a god-like figure, and defying him was a dangerous act. Moses' courage is reminiscent of the faith shown by his parents, who hid him as a baby, defying the king's edict. This phrase underscores the theme of divine protection and the futility of earthly power against God's will. Moses' actions foreshadow the ultimate deliverance of the Israelites and the defeat of Pharaoh's army at the Red Sea.<p><b>he persevered because he saw Him who is invisible</b><br>Moses' perseverance is attributed to his spiritual vision, seeing "Him who is invisible." This phrase emphasizes the importance of faith in the unseen God, a central theme in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>. Moses' relationship with God was intimate and personal, as evidenced by his encounters with God at the burning bush and on Mount Sinai. This spiritual insight enabled Moses to endure hardships and lead the Israelites through the wilderness. It reflects the Christian call to live by faith, not by sight, trusting in God's presence and promises. Moses' vision of the invisible God is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is known for leading the Israelites out of Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments from God.

But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelled in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.">Exodus 2:15</a>), or to the Exodus. The former view, which seems to be taken by all ancient writers and by most in modern times, is supported by the following arguments:--(1) The institution of the Passover is mentioned later in this chapter (<a href="/hebrews/11-28.htm" title="Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.">Hebrews 11:28</a>); (2) the second departure was made at Pharaoh's urgent <span class= "ital">request</span> (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm" title="And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.">Exodus 12:31</a>); (3) "he forsook" is too personal an expression to be used of the general Exodus. On the other side it is urged with great force: (1) that, although the actual departure from Egypt followed the institution of the Passover, the "forsaking" really commenced in the demand of <a href="/context/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1-3</a>, persevered in until the anger of the king was powerfully excited (<a href="/hebrews/10-28.htm" title="He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:">Hebrews 10:28</a>); (2) that, as might have been certainly foreseen, the wrath of both king and people was aroused as soon as the people had departed (<a href="/exodus/14-5.htm" title="And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?">Exodus 14:5</a>); (3) that the flight to Midian was directly caused by fear (<a href="/context/exodus/2-14.htm" title="And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? intend you to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.">Exodus 2:14-15</a>); (4) that the following words, "he endured, &c.," are much more applicable to the determined persistency of Moses and his repeated disappointments (Exodus 5-12) than to the inaction of his years of exile. On the whole the latter interpretation seems preferable. If the former be adopted, we must distinguish between the apprehension which led him (4) to seek safety in flight and the courage which enabled him to give up Egypt. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</span> This forsaking of Egypt must, because of the order in which it comes and of Moses alone being mentioned, be his flight related in <a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>, not the final Exodus. The only seeming difficulty is in the expression, "not fearing the wrath of the king," whereas in the history Moses is represented as flying in fear from the face of Pharaoh, who sought to slay him. But the two views of his attitude of mind are reconcilable. The assertion of his fearlessness applies to his whole course of action from the time when he elected to brave the king in behalf of Israel. In pursuance of this course, it became necessary for him to leave Egypt for a time. In this, as well as in staying, there was danger; for the king might pursue him: he might, perhaps, have secured his own safety by returning to the court and giving up his project; but he persevered at all hazards. And thus the apprehension of immediate danger under which he fled the country with a view to final success, was in no contradiction to his general fearlessness. Further, his being content to leave Egypt at all, and that for so many years, and still never relinquishing his design, was an additional evidence of faith, as is expressed by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "he endured."
