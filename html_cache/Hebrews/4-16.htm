The "throne of grace" signifies God's sovereign authority combined with His willingness to bestow grace. In the context of the Old Testament, the throne of God was often associated with judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>. However, through Christ's atoning work, believers are invited to approach with confidence, a concept echoed in <a href="/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>, where Paul speaks of having boldness and access through faith in Christ. The confidence mentioned here is not arrogance but a trust in the completed work of Jesus, who serves as our High Priest, as elaborated in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-15</a>.<p><b>so that we may receive mercy</b><br>Mercy here refers to God's compassion and forgiveness towards humanity. In the cultural context of the time, mercy was often sought from rulers or judges, but here it is freely given by God. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who often emphasized God's mercy, as seen in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>). The concept of receiving mercy is also tied to the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where the high priest would enter the Holy of Holies to atone for the people's sins, a role now fulfilled by Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p><b>and find grace</b><br>Grace is the unmerited favor of God, a central theme in the New Testament. It is through grace that believers are saved, as stated in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>. The idea of finding grace suggests an active seeking and receiving, which is made possible through Jesus' sacrifice. This grace empowers believers to live godly lives, as seen in <a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-12</a>. Theologically, grace is a gift that transforms and sustains, providing strength and guidance in the believer's life.<p><b>to help us in our time of need</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the human condition of dependency on God. The "time of need" can refer to any situation where divine assistance is required, whether spiritual, emotional, or physical. Historically, the early Christian community faced persecution and hardship, making this promise of divine help particularly comforting. The assurance of God's help is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>, which describes God as a refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. This promise encourages believers to rely on God's provision and timing, trusting in His perfect will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne_of_grace.htm">The Throne of Grace</a></b><br>This is a metaphorical representation of God's presence and authority, emphasizing His readiness to dispense grace and mercy to believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>In the context of Hebrews, Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate High Priest who intercedes for believers, making it possible to approach God with confidence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience_of_hebrews.htm">The Audience of Hebrews</a></b><br>The letter is addressed to Jewish Christians who were familiar with the Old Testament sacrificial system and the role of the high priest.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_christ.htm">Confidence in Christ</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to approach God with confidence, not because of their own merit, but because of the finished work of Christ.
