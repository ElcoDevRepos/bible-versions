In the early church, leaders such as apostles, prophets, and teachers played a crucial role in establishing and nurturing the faith of believers. The term "leaders" here likely refers to those who have passed away, as the context suggests reflecting on their lives and teachings. This aligns with the broader biblical principle of respecting and learning from those who have been entrusted with spiritual oversight, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>. The phrase also underscores the authority of the Word of God, which these leaders communicated, highlighting the centrality of Scripture in the life of the church.<p><b>Consider the outcome of their way of life</b><br>This part of the verse calls believers to observe the results or "outcome" of their leaders' lives. The Greek term used here can imply the end or goal of their conduct, suggesting a focus on the ultimate impact and legacy of their faithfulness. Historically, many early Christian leaders faced persecution and martyrdom, which served as powerful testimonies to their steadfast faith. This exhortation encourages believers to evaluate the fruit of their leaders' lives, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>, where He spoke about recognizing true prophets by their fruits. The outcome of a godly life often includes spiritual maturity, effective ministry, and a lasting influence on others.<p><b>and imitate their faith.</b><br>The call to "imitate their faith" is a directive to follow the example set by these leaders in their trust and reliance on God. Imitation is a common theme in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to emulate the faith and conduct of those who follow Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>, where Paul urges believers to imitate him as he imitates Christ. This imitation is not about copying external behaviors but adopting the same deep-seated faith and commitment to God. The faith of these leaders was characterized by perseverance, courage, and a focus on eternal promises, qualities that are essential for all believers. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of faith as a journey and a relationship with God, exemplified by figures like Abraham, whose faith was credited to him as righteousness (<a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders.htm">Leaders</a></b><br>Refers to spiritual leaders or elders in the early Christian community who taught and exemplified the Word of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrews.htm">Hebrews</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, likely Jewish Christians who were familiar with the Old Testament and the teachings of Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/word_of_god.htm">Word of God</a></b><br>The teachings and doctrines of Christianity as conveyed through the Scriptures and the apostles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_spiritual_leaders.htm">Respect for Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>Recognize and honor those who have taught and guided you in the faith.

The word is similarly used by St. Luke (see <a href="/luke/22-26.htm">Luke 22:26</a>; <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>; also below, ver. 17 and ver. 24). St. Paul, with a like meaning, calls the rulers of the Church <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: see <a href="/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>), <span class="cmt_word">who spake to you the Word of God; of whose conversation</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. course of life</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>considering the end</span> (or <span class="accented">issue</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">imitate their faith.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus Christ is yesterday and today the same, and forever.</span> This allusion to departed leaders shows the comparatively late date of the Epistle. Those who had died as martyrs, and hence, having a peculiar halo round them in the issue of their lives, may be supposed to be especially referred to; such as Stephen the proto-martyr at Jerusalem, James the son of Zebedee, and possibly James the Just, the acknowledged leader of the Jewish Christians. It may be that Peter, the apostle of the circumcision, had also suffered before the writing of the Epistle. This supposition, however, which would involve a date for the Epistle after St. Paul's death also, is by no means necessary. Others, too, may be alluded to of whom we have no record, but whose memory would be fresh in the minds of the readers. But it does not follow that martyrs only are intended. Others also who had died in peace, and whose end had been blessed, might be pointed to as models for the imitation of survivors. Ver. 8 must be taken as a distinct appended sentence, the watchword on which the preceding exhortation is based. Its drift is that, though successive generations pass away, Jesus Christ remains the same - the Savior of the living as well as of the departed, and the Savior of all to the end of time. It may be here observed that, though his eternal Deity is not distinctly expressed - for "yesterday" does not of necessity reach back to past eternity - yet the sentence can hardly be taken as not implying it. For his unchangeableness is contrasted with the changing generations of men, as is that of Jehovah in the Old Testament (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2-4</a>), and surely such language would not have been used of any but a Divine Being. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/13-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Remember</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Mn&#275;moneuete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3421.htm">Strong's 3421: </a> </span><span class="str2">From a derivative of mneme; to exercise memory, i.e. Recollect; by implication, to punish; also to rehearse.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hym&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
