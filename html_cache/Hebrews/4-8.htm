However, the "rest" Joshua provided was primarily physical and temporary, involving the conquest and settlement of Canaan. This rest was not the ultimate spiritual rest that God intended for His people. The historical context shows that despite entering the land, the Israelites continued to struggle with disobedience and idolatry, indicating that the rest was incomplete. This phrase suggests that Joshua's leadership, while significant, was a type pointing to a greater rest to be fulfilled in Christ, who offers spiritual rest and eternal salvation.<p><b>God would not have spoken later</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the continued revelation and promises of God beyond the time of Joshua. The mention of "later" implies that God's plan for rest was not fully realized in the Old Testament period. The Psalms, particularly <a href="/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>, are often cited as evidence that God continued to speak about a future rest, indicating that the rest Joshua provided was not the final fulfillment. This ongoing revelation underscores the progressive nature of God's redemptive plan, which unfolds throughout Scripture and culminates in the New Testament.<p><b>about another day</b><br>The "another day" signifies a future time when true rest would be available. This points to the eschatological rest found in Jesus Christ, who invites believers to enter into His rest through faith. The concept of "another day" also connects to the Sabbath rest, which serves as a shadow of the rest believers find in Christ. This future rest is both a present reality for believers who trust in Christ and a future hope of eternal rest in the presence of God. Theologically, it emphasizes the already-but-not-yet aspect of God's kingdom, where believers experience rest now but await its full consummation in the age to come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The successor of Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

The writer has just quoted <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7&#8211;11</a>, reminding readers that God once said, &#8220;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.&#8221; That &#8220;today&#8221; still stands because God&#8217;s promise of entering His rest has not been exhausted (<a href="/hebrews/4-6.htm">Hebrews 4:6-7</a>). By opening with &#8220;For,&#8221; the author now supplies the reason we can be sure the promise remains.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a> was penned centuries after Israel entered Canaan under Joshua, yet it still urged God&#8217;s people to enter His rest.<p>&#8226; Therefore, the rest offered in <a href="/bsb/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>&#8212;and now in Hebrews&#8212;is more than the land of Canaan; it is something deeper and ongoing.<p>Cross references woven in: <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1, 6</a>-7.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If Joshua had given them rest</b><p>Joshua did lead Israel into the Promised Land, and God &#8220;gave them rest on every side&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>). Yet that rest was provisional: enemies remained, hearts strayed, and full obedience never materialized (<a href="/judges/2-6.htm">Judges 2:6-19</a>). The author of Hebrews points out that if Joshua&#8217;s conquest had fully satisfied God&#8217;s rest, no later invitation would be necessary.<p>Consider how Scripture itself signals the incompleteness of Joshua&#8217;s rest:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9</a> foresaw a rest still ahead even before Israel crossed the Jordan.<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-4</a> shows lingering conflict in the land after Joshua.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a> pictures a future day when &#8220;His resting place will be glorious,&#8221; pointing beyond Israel&#8217;s early history.<p>So, Joshua&#8217;s achievement was a historical milestone but not the ultimate fulfillment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God would not have spoken later</b><p>&#8220;Later&#8221; points to the time of King David, who wrote <a href="/bsb/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a> roughly 400 years after Joshua. Because God &#8220;spoke&#8221; through David (<a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>), His invitation remained open. This underscores two truths:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word is living and active (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>); when He speaks, His promises endure until fully realized.<p>&#8226; Successive revelations in Scripture build, they do not contradict. The rest first pictured in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>, partially tasted in Joshua&#8217;s day, is still on offer in David&#8217;s psalm and in Hebrews.<p>The writer&#8217;s logic is tight: if the earlier rest were final, God&#8217;s later speech would make no sense. Scripture&#8217;s coherence proves there is more to come.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About another day</b><p>&#8220;Another day&#8221; signals a future, ultimate Sabbath rest. <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a> immediately confirms, &#8220;There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.&#8221; Two dimensions shine through:<p>1. Present reality<p>&#8226; Jesus now invites, &#8220;Come to Me&#8230;and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers enjoy peace with God through faith (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>) and experience His rest by ceasing from self-effort (<a href="/hebrews/4-10.htm">Hebrews 4:10</a>).<p>2. Future fulfillment<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a> promises rest from labors when God&#8217;s people enter glory.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a> speaks of God granting &#8220;relief&#8221; (rest) to the afflicted at Christ&#8217;s return.<p>&#8226; Thus, &#8220;another day&#8221; points to the consummation of salvation, when creation itself shares in God&#8217;s Sabbath peace (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-23</a>).<p>The land of Canaan foreshadowed it; Christ guarantees it; eternity will reveal it in full.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a> teaches that the rest Joshua provided was real yet incomplete. Because God later called His people to enter &#8220;another day&#8221; of rest, Scripture makes clear that a greater, enduring Sabbath remains. That rest is presently tasted through faith in Christ and will be perfectly realized when He returns. The verse assures believers that God&#8217;s promise has not expired; the door to His ultimate rest stands open today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) For, had the promise been fulfilled in Joshua's conquest, the Psalm (God in the Psalm) would not be speaking of another day, saying "To-day" (<a href="/hebrews/4-7.htm" title="Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.">Hebrews 4:7</a>). (In one other place in the New Testament the Greek form of the name of Joshua is preserved. See the Note on <a href="/acts/7-45.htm" title="Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David;">Acts 7:45</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day</span>.
