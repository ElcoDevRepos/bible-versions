The author of Hebrews is quoting from the Old Testament, specifically <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, which speaks of the certainty and timing of God's promises. The phrase "in just a little while" reflects the early Christian belief in the imminent return of Christ, a theme prevalent throughout the New Testament. This urgency is meant to encourage believers to remain steadfast in their faith and to live in anticipation of Christ's return.<p><b>He who is coming</b><br>This refers to Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christian eschatology. The expectation of His return is a foundational doctrine in Christianity, often referred to as the Second Coming. This phrase connects to other New Testament passages such as <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, which describe the return of Christ in glory. The anticipation of His coming serves as a source of hope and motivation for believers to persevere in their faith.<p><b>will come</b><br>The certainty of Christ's return is underscored here. The use of "will come" affirms the promise made by Jesus Himself in passages like <a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>, where He assures His disciples of His return. This assurance is meant to provide comfort and encouragement to believers facing trials and persecution, reminding them that their faithfulness will be rewarded.<p><b>and will not delay.</b><br>This phrase reinforces the idea that God's timing is perfect and that His promises will be fulfilled without unnecessary postponement. While human perception of time may differ, God's plan unfolds according to His divine schedule. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, which explains that the Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, but is patient, allowing time for repentance. The assurance that He "will not delay" serves to strengthen the resolve of believers to remain vigilant and faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

Peter balances the thought in <a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8&#8211;9</a>, explaining that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, yet He remains &#8220;patient &#8230; not wanting anyone to perish.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He who is coming</b><p>- The identity is unmistakably Jesus Christ. <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a> assures us that the same Jesus who ascended will return in like manner. <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a> says, &#8220;Look, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him.&#8221;<p>- Jesus Himself promised, &#8220;I will come again and receive you to Myself&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>). <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a> ties His return to our final salvation: &#8220;He will appear a second time &#8230; to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will come</b><p>- The certainty of Christ&#8217;s return rests on God&#8217;s unbreakable word.

Holding fast to this promise fuels perseverance, holiness, and confident anticipation until the day our Lord appears.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) The connection is this: "Ye have need of endurance" for "the end is not yet" (<a href="/matthew/24-6.htm" title="And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.">Matthew 24:6</a>); ye shall "receive the promise," for the Lord shall surely come, and that soon.<p><span class= "bld">A little while.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">a very little while.</span> The expression is remarkable and unusual; it is evidently taken from <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm" title="Come, my people, enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about you: hide yourself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be over.">Isaiah 26:20</a>--"Come my people . . . hide thyself for <span class= "ital">a little moment</span> until the indignation be overpast." The subject of this passage, from which the one expressive phrase is taken, is the coming of Jehovah "to punish the inhabitants of the <span class= "bld">And he that shall come will come.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">He that cometh will come and will not tarry.</span> In this and the next verse the writer of the Epistle takes up a passage, <a href="/context/habakkuk/2-3.htm" title="For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.">Habakkuk 2:3-4</a>, which occupies a very important place in the writings of St. Paul (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a>), and, as we have already seen (Note on <a href="/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a>), in the later Jewish teaching. St. Paul's citations are limited to a few words of <a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm" title="For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.">Hebrews 10:4</a>, "But the just shall live by faith;" here are quoted the whole of the fourth verse and part of the third. Perhaps it is too much to say that they are <span class= "ital">quoted, </span>they are rather applied, for, as will be seen, the order of the clauses (see next verse) is changed, and some alterations are made in the language. It is important in this Epistle to discriminate between the instances of direct quotation from the Scripture, where the word of God is appealed to as furnishing proof, and those in which passages of the Old Testament are explained and applied (see the Note on <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>). The words before us nearly agree with the LXX., "If he delay, wait for him, because coming he will come, and will not tarry." The subject of the sentence there is not clear; probably the translator believed that the Lord spoke thus of His own coming, or the coming of the future Deliverer. In the Hebrew all relates to the vision, "it will surely come, it will not tarry." The only difference between the LXX. and the words as they stand here consists in the substitution of "He that cometh" for "coming." Now the reference to the Deliverer and Judge is made plain. No designation of the Messiah, perhaps, was more familiar than "He that cometh" (<a href="/matthew/11-3.htm" title="And said to him, Are you he that should come, or do we look for another?">Matthew 11:3</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>); but in is here employed with a new reference--to the second advent in place of the first. The departure from the sense of the Hebrew is not as great as may at first appear. When the prophet says "The <span class= "ital">vision</span> . . . shall surely come," it is of that which the vision revealed that he speaks, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the fall of the Chaldeans; but the salvation of Israel from present danger is throughout the prophets the symbol of the great deliverance (comp. <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm" title="Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.">Hebrews 12:26</a> and <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;">Haggai 2:6</a>). With this verse comp. <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm" title="Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.">Hebrews 10:25</a>; also <a href="/philippians/4-5.htm" title="Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.">Philippians 4:5</a>; <a href="/james/5-8.htm" title="Be you also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws near.">James 5:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm" title="But the end of all things is at hand: be you therefore sober, and watch to prayer.">1Peter 4:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm" title="Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly.

And again, The Lord shall judge his people.">Hebrews 10:30</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37, 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For yet a little</span> (rather, <span class="accented">very little</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>while, and he that cometh will come, and will not tarry. But the just shall live by faith: and if he draw back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.</span> In these verses, after the manner of the Epistle, what is being urged is supported by an Old Testament quotation (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3, 4</a>), its drift being <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the certainty, notwithstanding delay, of the fulfillment of the Divine promise; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the necessity meanwhile of continuance in faith and perseverance. The quotation serves also as a step of transition (this, too, after the Epistle's manner) to the disquisition on <span class="accented">faith</span>, which forms the subject of the following chapter. For the prophet speaks of <span class="accented">faith</span> as what the righteous one is to live by until the Lord come. It was <span class="accented">faith -</span> a fuller faith - that the Hebrew Christians wanted to preserve them from the faltering of which they showed some signs; and the requirement of <span class="accented">faith</span> was no new thing - it had been the essential principle of all true religious life from the beginning, and thus is led up to the review which follows of the Old Testament history, showing that this had always been so. The quotation, as usual, is from the LXX., which, in this case as in some others, differs from the Hebrew. But here, as in ver. 29, <span class="accented">supra</span>, the LXX. is not exactly followed. The writer cites freely, so as to apply the essential meaning of the passage to his purpose. The Prophet Habakkuk (writing probably during the long evil days of Manasseh) had in his immediate view the trials of faith peculiar to his own time - violence and iniquity in Israel, and imminence of judgment at the hands of Chaldean conquerors, under which he had cried, "O Lord, how long?" But he stands upon his watch and sits upon his tower, to look out what the LORD will say to him in answer to his difficulties. And the LORD answered him, and said, "<span class="accented">Write</span> the vision, and make it plain upon the tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie [rather, 'but it hasteth to the end, and doth not lie']: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, and not tarry [or, 'be behindhand']. Behold, his soul that is lifted up is not upright in him [or, 'behold, his soul is lifted up, it is not upright in him']; but the just shall live by his faith." The drift of this Divine answer, which inspired the song of joyful confidence with which the Book of Habakkuk so beautifully concludes, is, as aforesaid, that, in spite of all appearances, the prophetic vision will ere long be realized; God's promises to the righteous will certainly be fulfilled; and that faith meanwhile must be their sustaining principle. The variations of the LXX. from the Hebrew are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, instead of "It (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vision) shall come;"  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/10-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
