In the historical context of ancient Israel, teaching about God was often the responsibility of priests, prophets, and elders. The phrase suggests a future time when direct knowledge of God will be universally accessible, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This is a fulfillment of the prophecy found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, indicating a shift from external instruction to internal understanding through the Holy Spirit. The cultural context of the time emphasized communal learning and oral tradition, but this promise points to a personal and intimate relationship with God for each believer.<p><b>because they will all know Me,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the inclusivity and universality of the new covenant. The knowledge of God will not be limited to a specific group, such as the Israelites, but will extend to all people. This reflects the democratization of spiritual knowledge, where every individual has the opportunity to know God personally. Theologically, this aligns with the New Testament teaching of the priesthood of all believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), where each person has direct access to God through Jesus Christ. The phrase also highlights the transformative work of the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to understand and experience God's presence in their lives.<p><b>from the least of them to the greatest.</b><br>This phrase underscores the egalitarian nature of the new covenant, where social status, education, or background do not determine one's ability to know God. In the historical and cultural context of the first-century church, society was highly stratified, with clear distinctions between classes. However, the new covenant breaks down these barriers, offering equal access to God for everyone, regardless of their position in society. This is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who often ministered to the marginalized and emphasized the value of every individual (<a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>). The phrase also reflects the prophetic vision of a time when God's kingdom will be fully realized, and all people will live in harmony with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.
