The term "sons" signifies believers who are adopted into God's family (<a href="/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14-17</a>). The concept of glory refers to the ultimate salvation and eternal life with God, a theme consistent with the promises found in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>). This reflects the fulfillment of God's covenant promises to His people.<p><b>it was fitting for God</b><br>The phrase suggests that God's actions are always in harmony with His character and purposes. The idea of "fitting" implies that the plan of salvation through Christ's suffering aligns with God's nature of justice, love, and holiness. This aligns with the biblical theme that God's ways are perfect (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>) and His plans are always for the ultimate good (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><b>for whom and through whom all things exist</b><br>This acknowledges God's sovereignty and role as Creator and Sustainer of the universe (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>). It emphasizes that everything exists for God's glory and by His power. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's ultimate authority and purpose in creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> and throughout the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><b>to make the author of their salvation</b><br>The term "author" can also be translated as "pioneer" or "captain," indicating that Jesus is the leader and initiator of salvation. This connects to the typology of Jesus as the new Moses, leading His people to the promised land of eternal life (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>). It also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about a coming Savior (Isaiah 53).<p><b>perfect through suffering</b><br>This phrase underscores the necessity of Christ's suffering as part of His mission. The concept of being made "perfect" does not imply that Jesus was imperfect, but rather that His role as Savior was completed and fully realized through His suffering and death (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-9</a>). This is consistent with the Messianic prophecies of a suffering servant (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>) and highlights the redemptive purpose of Christ's suffering for humanity's salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator and Sustainer of all things, who orchestrates the plan of salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as the "author of their salvation," who is made perfect through suffering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_to_glory.htm">Sons to Glory</a></b><br>Believers who are brought into a relationship with God and share in His glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation.htm">Salvation</a></b><br>The process by which believers are redeemed and brought into eternal life through Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/suffering.htm">Suffering</a></b><br>The means by which Jesus was made perfect, highlighting the necessity of His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>Recognize that God, as the Creator and Sustainer, has a perfect plan for salvation that includes suffering as a means of perfection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_suffering.htm">The Role of Suffering</a></b><br>Understand that suffering is not purposeless but is used by God to perfect and mature believers, just as it was used to perfect Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_the_author_of_salvation.htm">Christ as the Author of Salvation</a></b><br>Acknowledge Jesus as the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who leads us to glory through His own suffering and triumph.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/our_identity_as_sons_and_daughters.htm">Our Identity as Sons and Daughters</a></b><br>Embrace the identity of being brought to glory as children of God, sharing in the inheritance of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_trials.htm">Endurance in Trials</a></b><br>Encourage perseverance in the face of trials, knowing that they serve a greater purpose in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_2_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 2:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_2_10_on_Jesus_role_to_glory.htm">How does Hebrews 2:10 describe Jesus' role in bringing "many sons to glory"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Heb_2_10_say_about_Jesus_mission.htm">What does "perfect through suffering" in Hebrews 2:10 reveal about Jesus' earthly mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Emulate_Jesus_suffering_for_God_today.htm">How can we emulate Jesus' example of suffering for God's purpose today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Heb_2_10_Isa_53_5_on_Jesus_suffering.htm">Connect Hebrews 2:10 with Isaiah 53:5 on the purpose of Jesus' suffering.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Heb_2_10_on_daily_faith.htm">How does understanding Jesus' suffering in Hebrews 2:10 impact your daily faith walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Purpose_of_Jesus_suffering_in_Heb_2_10.htm">How does Hebrews 2:10 define the purpose of Jesus' suffering and glory?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Jesus_called_author_of_salvation.htm">Why is Jesus referred to as the "author of salvation" in Hebrews 2:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_perfect_through_suffering.htm">What does "perfect through suffering" mean in the context of Hebrews 2:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_hebrews_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Hebrews 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_hebrews_2_10_mean.htm">What does Hebrews 2:10 mean about bringing sons to glory?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_occurs_following_death.htm">What occurs following death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_jesus_'become'_savior_in_heb_5_9.htm">In Hebrews 5:9, how does Jesus &#8220;become&#8221; the source of eternal salvation if he was supposedly always the sinless savior?

For thus to make sufferings the path to His kingdom was worthy of God, for whose glory and through whose power all things exist; who as Creator commands all agencies, and who cannot but do that which will subserve His glory. If the means at which men wondered were chosen by God, no one may doubt their supreme fitness for the end. In what this fitness consisted the following words partially explain.<p><span class= "bld">In bringing</span>.--It is doubtful whether the Greek word should not be rendered, <span class= "ital">having brought.</span> With this translation we must certainly explain the words on the same principle as the past tenses of <a href="/context/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7-8</a>.

In <a href="/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a> it bears its original meaning, "Leader<span class= "ital">"</span> ("a Leader and a Saviour"); in <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a> and <a href="/acts/3-15.htm" title="And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.">Acts 3:15</a> the idea of "leading the way" has passed into that of origination. In the present case, also, <span class= "ital">Author</span> is the best rendering; but in a context which so distinctly presents our Lord as taking on Himself the conditions of man's lot, and so passing into the glory which He wins for man, the primary thought of <span class= "ital">leading</span> must not be entirely set aside. It is as the Author of salvation that He is made perfect through sufferings. Three aspects of this truth are presented in the Epistle. By His suffering unto death He "bare the sins of many" (<a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>); He offered the sacrifice of a perfect obedience (<a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>); He was enabled to be a perfect representative of man. This last thought pervades the remaining verses of the chapter. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it became him, for whom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, with accusative) <span class="cmt_word">are all things, and through whom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with genitive) <span class="cmt_word">are all things</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God), <span class="cmt_word">in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span> This refers to what was said in the preceding verse, of Christ having been crowned with glory on account of his suffering of death, and of his tasting death for all. That he should attain through human suffering even unto death to his own perfected state of glory, as being the Leader of human sons whom the one Father of all would bring to glory, was a design worthy of him for whom and through whom are all things - suitable to what we conceive of him and of his way of working. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> is used in the same sense not infrequently in the LXX. It is probably used here with some view to "<span class="accented">the</span> offence of the cross," which might still linger in the minds of some of the Hebrew Christians. In the argument that follows, supported still by reference to Old Testament anticipations, the writer not only meets possible objections lingering in the Hebrew mind, but also carries on and completes the view of the SON which it is his purpose to inculcate, leading up (as aforesaid) to the final position of his being the High Priest of humanity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In bringing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(agagonta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_71.htm">Strong's 71: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; properly, to lead; by implication, to bring, drive, go, pass, or induce.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">many</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pollous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4183.htm">Strong's 4183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many; often. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">sons</span><br /><span class="grk">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(huious)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5207.htm">Strong's 5207: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son, descendent.
