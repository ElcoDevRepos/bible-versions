The Greek term used here implies a measured response, neither overly harsh nor overly lenient. This aligns with the role of a priest as a mediator who understands human frailty. In the Old Testament, priests like Aaron were expected to show compassion, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>, where Aaron lays hands on the scapegoat, symbolizing the transfer of the people's sins.<p><b>with those who are ignorant and misguided</b><br>The reference to "ignorant and misguided" individuals points to those who sin unintentionally or out of lack of knowledge, as described in <a href="/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a>. In the Jewish sacrificial system, there were specific offerings for unintentional sins, emphasizing God's provision for human weakness. This also connects to Jesus' prayer on the cross in <a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing," illustrating His role as the ultimate high priest who intercedes for humanity.<p><b>since he himself is subject to weakness</b><br>This phrase underscores the humanity of the high priest, who shares in the same weaknesses as those he serves. In the context of Hebrews, this is a typology of Christ, who, though sinless, took on human form and experienced human limitations (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>). The high priest's own weaknesses made him empathetic, a quality that Jesus exemplified perfectly, as He was tempted in every way, just as we are, yet was without sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). This shared experience of weakness is crucial for the priest's ability to intercede effectively on behalf of the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>The role of the high priest in the Old Testament was to act as a mediator between God and the people, offering sacrifices for sins.

The compound had its origin, doubtless, in the peripatetic school, denoting the right mean between passionateness and Stoic <span class="accented">apathy</span>, being the application of Aristotle's <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> to the sphere of the passions. Thus Diog. Laert. says of Aristotle, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>. In this sense Philo uses <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> to express Abraham's sober grief after the death of Sarah (2:37) and Jacob's patience under his afflictions (2:45). The verb, followed, as here, by a dative of persons, may be taken, therefore, to denote moderation of feeling towards the persons indicated, such moderation being especially opposed in the case before us, where the persons are the ignorant and erring, to excess of severe or indignant feeling. Moderation, indeed, in this regard seems to have been the idea generally attached to the compound (cf. Plut., 'De Ira Cohib.' p. 453, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Josephus also speaks of the emperors Vespasian and Titus as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in their attitude towards the Jews after long hostility ('Ant.,' 12:3 2). This, then, being the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, it is obvious how the capacity of it is essential to the idea of a high priest as being one who is resorted to as a mediator by a people laden with infirmities, to represent them and to plead for them. It is not of necessity implied that every high priest was personally <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: it is the ideal of his office that is spoken cf. And, in the case of human high priests, this ideal was fulfilled by their being themselves human, encompassed themselves with the infirmity of those for whom they mediated. Christ also, so far, evidently fulfils the condition. For, though he is afterwards distinguished (<a href="/hebrews/7-28.htm">Hebrews 7:28</a>) from priests having themselves infirmity, yet he had, in his human nature, experienced what it was: "He was crucified <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>); "Himself took our infirmities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), and bare our sicknesses" (<a href="/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>); the agony in the garden (whatever its mysterious import, of which more below)expressed personal experience of human <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>.
