The high priest was chosen from the tribe of Levi, specifically from the descendants of Aaron. This appointment underscores the humanity of the high priest, emphasizing that he shares in the human condition and is able to empathize with those he represents. The high priest's humanity is crucial because it allows him to act as a mediator between God and the people, understanding their weaknesses and needs.<p><b>to represent them in matters relating to God</b><br>The high priest served as a mediator, a role that is central to the priestly function. This representation involved interceding on behalf of the people, bringing their concerns, sins, and needs before God. The high priest's role as a representative is a precursor to the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, who is described as the "one mediator between God and mankind" in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>. This function highlights the necessity of a go-between who can bridge the gap between a holy God and sinful humanity.<p><b>to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins</b><br>The offering of gifts and sacrifices was a fundamental duty of the high priest, as outlined in Leviticus. These offerings included both voluntary gifts and mandatory sacrifices, such as sin offerings and burnt offerings, which were essential for atonement and maintaining the covenant relationship with God. The sacrificial system pointed forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself once for all, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>. This phrase underscores the temporary and repetitive nature of the Old Testament sacrifices, which were ultimately fulfilled in the perfect and final sacrifice of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons
