The "confidence" refers to the boldness and assurance believers have in their relationship with God through Jesus Christ. In the context of Hebrews, this confidence is rooted in the new covenant established by Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>). Historically, the early Christian community faced persecution and social ostracism, which could tempt them to abandon their faith. The exhortation not to "throw away" this confidence suggests a deliberate action, emphasizing the importance of maintaining steadfastness. This echoes the call to perseverance found in <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6 and 4</a>:14, where believers are urged to hold firmly to their confidence and hope.<p><b>it holds a great reward.</b><br>The "great reward" is the promise of eternal life and the fulfillment of God's promises to His people. This reward is not merely future-oriented but also includes the present experience of God's presence and peace. The concept of reward is consistent with other New Testament teachings, such as in <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>, where believers are encouraged to look forward to the heavenly reward. Theologically, this reward is tied to the faithfulness of God, who honors those who diligently seek Him (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). The assurance of reward serves as motivation for believers to endure trials and remain faithful, reflecting the eschatological hope that is central to Christian belief.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.
