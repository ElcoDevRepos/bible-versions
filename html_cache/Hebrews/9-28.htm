The term "offered once" highlights the finality and completeness of Jesus' atonement, fulfilling the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus. The phrase "to bear the sins of many" echoes <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, where the Suffering Servant bears the iniquities of others, indicating Jesus as the fulfillment of this prophecy. The use of "many" signifies the vast scope of Christ's redemptive work, though not implying universal salvation, but rather the availability of salvation to all who believe (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>and He will appear a second time,</b><br>This points to the Second Coming of Christ, a core tenet of Christian eschatology. Unlike His first coming, which was marked by humility and suffering, His second appearance will be in glory and power (<a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>). This future event is anticipated throughout the New Testament (<a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>) and serves as a source of hope and encouragement for believers. The certainty of His return is a promise that motivates holy living and perseverance (<a href="/2_peter/3-11.htm">2 Peter 3:11-14</a>).<p><b>not to bear sin,</b><br>In His second coming, Christ's purpose will not be to deal with sin as He did in His first coming. His initial mission was to provide atonement through His death and resurrection (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>). The phrase underscores the completed work of salvation regarding sin, as Jesus' sacrifice was once and for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>). This distinction clarifies that His return will not involve another sacrificial act, as His first coming fully addressed the sin problem.<p><b>but to bring salvation</b><br>This refers to the consummation of salvation, which includes the final deliverance from sin's presence and the full realization of eternal life (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23-24</a>). While believers experience spiritual salvation now, the ultimate fulfillment occurs at Christ's return, when they will receive glorified bodies and eternal inheritance (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-54</a>). This future aspect of salvation is a key component of Christian hope and expectation.<p><b>to those who eagerly await Him.</b><br>This phrase describes the attitude of believers who live in anticipation of Christ's return. The eagerness reflects a deep longing and readiness, akin to the parable of the wise virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>. It implies a life of faithfulness and watchfulness, as believers are called to be prepared for His coming (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>). This expectation is not passive but involves active engagement in God's work and living a life that honors Him (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons

Those who trust Him live in joyful expectation, confident that the Savior who finished the work of atonement will soon appear to usher His people into eternal glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">So Christ was once offered.</span>--The ordinary translation, dividing the verse into two similar portions, fails to show where the emphasis really lies. The two members of the verse correspond to each other, point by point, with remarkable distinctness; but the first is clearly subordinated to the second. "So the Christ. also, having been once offered that He might bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time apart from sin to them that wait for Him unto salvation." It is important to notice that, not only is there perfect. parallelism between the two members of this verse, but there is a similar relation between this verse as a whole and <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm" title="And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:">Hebrews 9:27</a>. In that were presented two cardinal points of the history of sinful man; in this the main outlines of the Redeemer's work. Each verse deals first with the present world, and secondly with "the last things." The two verses, taken together, are connected with the preceding argument by the word "once." Christ will not "suffer" often. He has been manifested once, to accomplish by one act the "annulling" of sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>). And this is in harmony with the lot of man, who must die once, and but once (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-27.htm" title="And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:">Hebrews 9:27-28</a>). But what is the exact nature of this correspondence? Do the words simply mean that, as the Christ was man, so it was laid up for Him to die but once? Or may the connection of thought be expressed thus?--The work of redemption is so ordered as to correspond to the course of man's history: as man must die once, and what remains is the judgment which he must abide, so the Christ has died once, and what remains is His return for judgment--a judgment which He Himself administers, giving salvation to His people. We will not venture to say that the former thought is absent from the words (which are sufficiently general to include both), but certainly the second is the more important. If now we return to <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>, it will be seen that the words "having been once offered" in the first member are answered by "shall appear" in the second; "to bear sins," by "apart from sin . . . unto salvation;" and "of many," by "to them that wait for Him." In <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25</a>, the writer spoke of Christ as offering Himself, here as "having been offered;" so in <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a> we read that He "delivered Himself up for us," but in <a href="/romans/8-32.htm" title="He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?">Romans 8:32</a> that God "delivered Him up for us all," and in <a href="/romans/4-25.htm" title="Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.">Romans 4:25</a>, "who was delivered up for our offences." The words which follow are taken (with a slight change) from <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>, "and He bare the sin of many." These words clearly involve sacrificial imagery. What is signified is not directly the <span class= "ital">removal</span> of sin (as in the different words of <a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>); but, as on the animal to be slain the sins of the offerer were in figure laid, and the death which followed signified the death which the offerer had deserved, so, with an infinite extension of meaning, are the words here applied. It is certainly no mere accident that the writer, thus availing himself of the prophet's words, speaks of <span class= "ital">the Christ.</span> In contrast with the one Sufferer are the "many" whose sins are borne (comp. <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>). When the Christ shall appear the second time, it shall be "apart from sin"--no longer bearing sin, but "separate from sinners" (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>). Of the judgment which He shall pass upon "the adversaries" (<a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm" title="But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.">Hebrews 10:27</a>) this verse does not speak, but only of His appearing to His own people, who "wait for Him." This expressive word, again and again used by St. Paul (see Note on <a href="/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>) to describe the attitude of Christ's people upon earth towards their Lord (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-7.htm" title="So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1Corinthians 1:7</a>) and His salvation (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="/romans/8-25.htm" title="But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.">Romans 8:25</a>), is here applied to <span class= "ital">all</span> who love His appearing. By these "He shall be seen" as He is (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1John 3:2</a>). The last words "unto salvation" declare the purpose of His appearing, in a form which at once recalls the teaching of earlier verses in the Epistle (<a href="/hebrews/5-9.htm" title="And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;">Hebrews 5:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>), and especially <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a> of this chapter, and which brings to mind the name of Him for whom we wait, the Saviour (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>). . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/9-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">so</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hout&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3779.htm">Strong's 3779: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thus, so, in this manner.
