Thorns and thistles are often used in Scripture to symbolize sin, curse, and the consequences of disobedience, first seen in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-18</a>, where the ground is cursed because of Adam's sin. This imagery serves as a metaphor for spiritual barrenness and unfruitfulness, contrasting with the fruitful land that represents a life of faith and obedience.<p><b>is worthless</b><br>The term "worthless" indicates a lack of value or purpose. In a biblical context, this can be understood as a life that does not produce the fruits of righteousness, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-19.htm">Matthew 7:19</a>, where trees that do not bear good fruit are cut down. This reflects the idea that faith without works is dead, as <a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a> states. The worthlessness here is not about the inherent value of the person but about the failure to fulfill God's purpose.<p><b>and its curse is imminent</b><br>The concept of a curse is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where disobedience to God's commandments often resulted in curses, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The imminent curse suggests an impending judgment, echoing the warnings given to Israel for their unfaithfulness. This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the urgency of repentance.<p><b>In the end it will be burned</b><br>Burning is a common biblical metaphor for judgment and purification. In agricultural terms, burning was a method to clear unproductive land, making way for new growth. Spiritually, this reflects the final judgment, where unfruitful works are consumed, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13-15</a>. This also alludes to the eschatological fire of judgment mentioned in <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>. The burning signifies both the destruction of what is worthless and the hope of renewal and restoration through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

When a life habitually yields &#8220;thorns and thistles,&#8221; it shows a heart still under the curse announced in Eden. Such barrenness proves worthlessness, hastens judgment, and ends in fiery destruction. God calls every hearer to genuine repentance and faith that produces the fruit of righteousness&#8212;evidence of a life transformed by His grace and safe from the coming fire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">But that which beareth.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">But if it bear thorns and briars it is rejected.</span> We are told that the presence of briars (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>caltrops) is a sure evidence of a poor soil, on which labour will be wasted. The words are partially a quotation from <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm" title="Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field;">Genesis 3:18</a>. The change of translation here is important; if that very land, which has drunk in the abundant rain and has received careful culture still prove unfruitful, it is rejected. Man can do no more; and the curse of God is "near"; its end is "for burning." The explanation of the last words is probably found in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm" title="And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>, which speaks of the land of Sodom which God overthrew, which "is brimstone and salt and burning." The connection between these two verses and the preceding passages is obvious. In the case of the apostates there described, man is helpless; God's curse is near. But, as Chrysostom says, in this very word there is mercy; "the end" is not yet come.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/6-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[land that] produces</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#966;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(ekpherousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1627.htm">Strong's 1627: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bring out, carry out, sometimes out of the city for burial; I bring forth, bear, produce.
