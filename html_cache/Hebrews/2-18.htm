The Gospels, particularly <a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a> and <a href="/luke/4.htm">Luke 4:1-13</a>, detail Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, where He faced direct challenges from Satan. This suffering was not only physical but also emotional and spiritual, as He endured the full range of human experiences. Theologically, this underscores the doctrine of the Incarnation, where Jesus, fully God, became fully man (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). His suffering was necessary to fulfill His role as the perfect High Priest, who can empathize with human weaknesses (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><b>He is able to help those who are being tempted</b><br>This part of the verse assures believers of Jesus' ongoing support and intercession. His ability to help is rooted in His victory over temptation and sin, as seen in His earthly ministry and ultimately in His death and resurrection. This help is not just theoretical but practical, as He provides strength and guidance through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>). The concept of Jesus as a helper is consistent with His role as an advocate (1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>) and a mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).
