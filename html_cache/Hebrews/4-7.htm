The concept of "Today" is significant in biblical theology, representing the present moment of opportunity for repentance and faith. It reflects God's ongoing invitation to enter His rest, as seen in the context of <a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3 and 4</a>. The use of "again" suggests a repeated offer, highlighting God's patience and desire for people to respond to His call.<p><b>when a long time later He spoke through David</b><br>This refers to the period between the Israelites' wilderness journey and the time of King David, which spans several centuries. David, as a prophet and king, is a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate King and Savior. The reference to David underscores the continuity of God's message throughout history and the enduring relevance of His word. It also connects the Psalms, particularly <a href="/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>, to the New Testament audience, showing the timeless nature of God's call.<p><b>as was just stated:</b><br>This phrase indicates that the author of Hebrews is reiterating a previously mentioned point, emphasizing its importance. The repetition serves to reinforce the message and ensure that the audience understands the gravity of the exhortation. It also reflects a common teaching method in Scripture, where key truths are repeated for emphasis and clarity.<p><b>&#8220;Today, if you hear His voice,</b><br>This part of the verse is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-8</a>, which is a call to listen and respond to God's voice. Hearing God's voice implies not just auditory reception but an obedient response. In the biblical context, hearing is often synonymous with obeying. This call is relevant to the original audience of Hebrews, who were facing the temptation to turn away from their faith, and it remains relevant to believers today.<p><b>do not harden your hearts.&#8221;</b><br>The hardening of the heart is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with rebellion and unbelief. In the wilderness, the Israelites hardened their hearts against God despite witnessing His miracles, leading to their exclusion from the Promised Land. This serves as a warning to the readers of Hebrews and to all believers to remain receptive and obedient to God's voice. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. A hardened heart is resistant to God's influence and guidance, which can lead to spiritual downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine author and initiator of the call to obedience and faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, through whom God spoke, as referenced in the Psalms.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/today.htm">Today</a></b><br>A designated time of urgency and opportunity for obedience and faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original recipients of the warning, who hardened their hearts in the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites tested God and failed to enter His rest due to unbelief.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_today.htm">The Urgency of Today</a></b><br>The term "Today" signifies the immediacy and importance of responding to God's voice.
