It was used for burning incense, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God (<a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>). The incense was to be burned every morning and evening, representing continual prayer and intercession. This altar's presence in the Holy Place signifies the importance of prayer and worship in the life of the believer. In <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>, incense is again associated with the prayers of the saints, showing continuity in the symbolism from the Old to the New Testament.<p><b>and the gold-covered ark of the covenant</b><br>The ark of the covenant was the most sacred object in the tabernacle, representing God's throne on earth and His covenant with Israel. It was made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold, signifying both humanity and divinity. The ark was kept in the Most Holy Place, where God's presence dwelt between the cherubim on the mercy seat (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-22</a>). The ark's covering with gold points to the purity and holiness required to approach God. The ark is a type of Christ, who is both fully God and fully man, and through whom we have access to the Father (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><b>Inside the ark were the gold jar of manna</b><br>The gold jar of manna was a reminder of God's provision for the Israelites during their 40 years in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-32.htm">Exodus 16:32-34</a>). Manna, which means "What is it?" in Hebrew, was the bread from heaven that sustained the Israelites. This foreshadows Jesus Christ, the true bread from heaven, who sustains us spiritually (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>). The preservation of manna in a gold jar signifies the eternal nature of God's provision and faithfulness.<p><b>Aaron&#8217;s staff that had budded</b><br>Aaron's staff that budded was a sign of God's chosen priesthood (<a href="/numbers/17.htm">Numbers 17:1-10</a>). When Korah and others challenged Aaron's authority, God caused Aaron's rod to bud, blossom, and produce almonds overnight, confirming his divine appointment. This miraculous event prefigures Christ's resurrection, affirming His role as our eternal High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-25</a>). The staff's presence in the ark serves as a reminder of God's sovereign choice and the legitimacy of His appointed leaders.<p><b>and the stone tablets of the covenant</b><br>The stone tablets of the covenant, also known as the Ten Commandments, were given to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). They represent God's moral law and His covenant with Israel. The tablets being placed inside the ark signify the centrality of God's law in the life of His people. In the New Covenant, the law is written on believers' hearts (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>), fulfilled in Christ, who perfectly kept the law on our behalf (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).

The question raised does not merely concern the interpretation of a single verse, but has been brought into prominence in all recent discussions as to the authorship of the Epistle. It will be possible to notice all important points in the controversy without entering into any discussion of the Greek, for it is allowed on both sides that the word here used--<span class= "ital">thumiaterion</span> (which simply means an instrument or a place connected with the offering of incense)--will admit of either rendering. The usage of the LXX., in most cases peculiarly helpful in this Epistle, throws little light on the matter; for this word is entirely absent from the descriptions in the Pentateuch, and occurs twice only in later books (<a href="/ezekiel/8-11.htm" title="And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.">Ezekiel 8:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-19.htm" title="Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.">2Chronicles 26:19</a>--both times for "censer"). The Pentateuch, indeed, makes no mention of a special censer for the use of the high priest on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12</a>); but, as we learn from the Mishna, the later law not only prescribed a censer of gold, but laid stress on the particular kind of gold. On the other hand, in Philo and Josephus the word here used is the regular designation of the <span class= "ital">altar of incense.</span> That altar, it is true, was not of gold, only overlaid with gold; but as one of its names in common use was "the golden altar" (<a href="/exodus/40-5.htm" title="And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:5</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) this point is of no moment. If we look at internal probabilities, it is hard to decide which would be more surprising--the special mention of the censer (by the side of the ark and the cherubim) in this description of the Most Holy Place, or the absence of all notice of the incense-altar, which held so important a place in connection with the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement. Hence, though "censer" has (mainly through the influence of the Vulgate) been the more familiar rendering, the most eminent modern commentators have, with some marked exceptions, adopted the other view. Probably there would be little difference of opinion on the question, were it not that the words here used seem to assign to the altar of incense a place <span class= "ital">within the veil.</span> As, however, there are the strongest reasons for believing that the golden censer was not kept in the Holiest Place, this difficulty applies almost equally to both interpretations. At first sight the difficulty is very great. The incense-altar and the ark are coupled together, and the word which describes their relation to the Holiest Place is that which, a little later in this verse, distinctly signifies "containing." So weighty is this consideration that many have been unable to avoid the conclusion that the writer has erred in this matter of detail; and various suppositions have been resorted to in explanation of his mistake. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) But, to take the lowest ground, surely ignorance on such a point is inconceivable. Not only are the notices in Exodus perfectly plain, but passages in Philo and Josephus show how customary in the writer's own age it was to speak of the three sacred objects in the Holy Place--the candlestick, the table, and the golden altar. There must exist some special reason for this connection of the altar with the Most Holy Place--a connection which (we may well believe) would have been otherwise expressed had the writer held it possible that readers, familiar with the facts, could regard his language as even ambiguous. Such a reason will be found to be suggested by the language of the Pentateuch, and by the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement. In <a href="/exodus/30-6.htm" title="And you shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.">Exodus 30:6</a>, Moses receives special injunction to place the altar of incense "before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony;" similarly in <a href="/exodus/40-5.htm" title="And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:5</a>. The purification of this altar is most expressly associated with the purification of the Holiest Place on the Day of Atonement: this stands out in strong relief both in the Pentateuch (see <a href="/exodus/30-10.htm" title="And Aaron shall make an atonement on the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement on it throughout your generations: it is most holy to the LORD.">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-18.htm" title="And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.">Leviticus 16:18</a>) and in the Mishna. The typical significance of the altar of incense (comp. <a href="/context/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3-4</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-13.htm" title="And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,">Revelation 9:13</a>) we might also show to be in full harmony with the thought here presented. There is, however, one passage in the Old Testament (<a href="/1_kings/6-22.htm" title="And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.">1Kings 6:22</a>) which appears to give direct expression to what these other passages imply; for there the true translation must be, "also <span class= "ital">the whole altar that belongeth to the oracle</span> he overlaid with gold."<span class= "note">[10] . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/9-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">containing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(echousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
