His journey from being a deceiver to a man of faith is significant in understanding the development of Israel as a nation. Jacob's faith is highlighted in his reliance on God's promises, which were first given to his grandfather Abraham and then to his father Isaac. This faith is a key theme in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, which emphasizes the importance of faith in the lives of the patriarchs.<p><b>when he was dying</b><br>Jacob's actions at the end of his life reflect a deep trust in God's promises, even as he faced death. This moment is recorded in <a href="/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>, where Jacob, aware of his impending death, gathers his strength to bless his descendants. The act of blessing at the time of death was a significant cultural practice, symbolizing the passing on of spiritual and familial heritage. It underscores the belief in the continuity of God's covenant through generations.<p><b>blessed each of Joseph&#8217;s sons</b><br>Jacob's blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph's sons, is a pivotal moment that reflects the extension of God's covenant promises to the next generation. In <a href="/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>, Jacob intentionally crosses his hands to place his right hand on Ephraim, the younger, signifying the reversal of the traditional birthright. This act prefigures the biblical theme of God's sovereign choice, often favoring the younger or the unexpected, as seen in the selection of David over his brothers and the calling of the Gentiles.<p><b>and worshiped</b><br>Jacob's worship at this moment signifies his acknowledgment of God's faithfulness throughout his life. Worship here is an expression of gratitude and reverence, recognizing God's hand in fulfilling His promises. This act of worship is a testament to Jacob's transformation and his recognition of God's sovereignty and grace.<p><b>as he leaned on the top of his staff</b><br>The image of Jacob leaning on his staff is rich with symbolism. The staff represents his journey and the trials he endured, including his wrestling with God at Peniel, where he was left with a limp. This physical weakness became a reminder of his dependence on God. The staff also signifies the pilgrim nature of Jacob's life, as he sojourned in foreign lands, always looking forward to the fulfillment of God's promises. This act of leaning on his staff while worshiping highlights the humility and faith of a patriarch who trusted in God's promises despite his own frailty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Also known as Israel, Jacob is a patriarch in the Bible, the son of Isaac and the grandson of Abraham.

The verse calls every believer to live&#8212;and die&#8212;with that same steadfast, worship-filled faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Both the sons.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">each of the sons.</span> The separate character of the two blessings is thus brought out (<a href="/context/genesis/48-14.htm" title="And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.">Genesis 48:14-19</a>). (See the last Note.) In the case of the two events mentioned in this verse the order of time is reversed, probably that the blessing of Jacob may immediately follow the similar record of <a href="/hebrews/11-20.htm" title="By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.">Hebrews 11:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And worshipped.</span>--The incident referred to will be found in <a href="/genesis/47-31.htm" title="And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself on the bed's head.">Genesis 47:31</a>. After receiving from Joseph a promise, confirmed by oath, that he shall be buried with his fathers, "Israel bowed himself upon" (or, <span class= "ital">worshipped towards</span>) "the bed's head." In the LXX. and in the Targums the words are understood as denoting an act of worship. The Greek translators have taken the last word of the Hebrew verse <span class= "ital">to</span> denote "staff" (<a href="/genesis/32-10.htm" title="I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed to your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.">Genesis 32:10</a>), not "bed," the words which bear these different meanings differing very slightly in form. The whole clause is given here as it stands in the LXX., the difference between the renderings being immaterial for the purpose which the writer had in view. The quotation of the familiar words serves to recall the scene, and brings before us Israel's thankful and devout satisfaction when assured that he should rest with his fathers in the land of Canaan; by this, at the point of death, he expressed his faith in the promise by which Abraham and his seed received Canaan as their inheritance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith Jacob, when he was a-dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</span> Here two distinct incidents are referred to, both at the close of Jacob's life. That first mentioned, the blessing of the sons of Joseph (<a href="/genesis/48-2.htm">Genesis 48:2</a>), closely resembles the dying act of Isaac already spoken of, and has a similar significance. In both cases, too, human intention is overruled, in that the younger son obtains the higher blessing; and each patriarch accepts alike the Divine intimation to this effect, thus further evincing faith in a power and a will above his own. The latter part of the verse, "and worshipped," etc., is quoted from <a href="/genesis/47-31.htm">Genesis 47:31</a>, and refers to a previous instance of the dying Jacob's faith, in his charge to Joseph to bury him with his fathers in the land of promise. The reversal in the text of the historical order of the two instances may be because the one referred to first is cognate with the instance of Isaac's faith which has gone before, the other with that of Joseph's which follows. For the benedictions of Isaac and Jacob, when a-dying, expressed faith in revelations made to them about the several races of their future seed; the deathbed charges of Jacob and Joseph expressed faith in the chosen seed's inheritance of the Promised Land. Though in the verse before us Jacob's charge to Joseph, with a view to this inheritance, is not mentioned, yet the quotation from the account of it in Genesis, "and worshipped," etc., would be sufficient, in this concise summary of instances, to recall it to the mind of readers, and so intimate the writer's meaning. The variation of the LXX., which is here followed as usual, from the Massoretic text, in reading "staff" instead of "bed," is due to the ambiguity of the Hebrew word, which has one meaning or the other according to its pointing. "Bed" seems more likely to have been intended, inasmuch as the bed on which the patriarch lay is twice again mentioned (<a href="/genesis/48-2.htm">Genesis 48:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>) in the account of the closing scene; and we find also a similar expression used of David in his old age (<a href="/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47</a>). Bat the variation is unimportant, the essence of the passage being in the word translated "bowed himself," which in the Hebrew as well as the Greek certainly expresses an act of worship. The only difference is that, according to one rendering, this worship was expressed by his bowing over the staff on which he leant as he sat upon the bed (<a href="/genesis/48-2.htm">Genesis 48:2</a>); according to the other, by his turning round to prostrate himself with his head upon the pillow. The view of some of the Fathers, who, adopting the LXX. rendering and supposing the staff to be Joseph's, regard the act as expressing reverence to Joseph himself, in fulfillment of Gem 38:5-11, has little probability in its favor, and is controverted by St. Augustine. But so Chrysostom, and apparently Theodoret. And suitably to this idea, the Vulgate has in Hebrews, "et adoravit fastigium virgae ejus," though in Genesis, "adoravit Israel Deum, conversus ad lectuli caput."
