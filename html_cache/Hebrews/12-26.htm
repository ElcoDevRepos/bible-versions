The earth-shaking voice of God is described in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18-19</a>, where the mountain trembled violently. This event signifies God's powerful presence and the seriousness of His covenant with Israel. The shaking of the earth symbolizes divine intervention and the establishment of a new order, emphasizing God's authority and holiness.<p><b>but now He has promised</b><br>This part of the verse introduces a contrast between the past and the present. The promise mentioned here is a reference to <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>, where God declares that He will shake the heavens and the earth. This promise indicates a future event, suggesting a shift from the old covenant to the new covenant through Jesus Christ. It highlights God's ongoing plan and the fulfillment of His promises through Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>&#8220;Once more I will shake not only the earth, but heaven as well.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "once more" implies a finality and completeness to the coming shaking. This shaking is not limited to the physical realm but extends to the spiritual realm, indicating a cosmic transformation. It points to the eschatological events described in Revelation, where the heavens and the earth will be renewed. This shaking signifies the removal of what is temporary and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom.

For believers, this promise is not a cause for fear but a reason for steadfast hope, because the God who shakes creation also secures His children in the kingdom that can never be moved.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Shook the earth.</span>--<a href="/context/exodus/19-18.htm" title="And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.">Exodus 19:18-19</a>; <a href="/context/judges/5-4.htm" title="LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.">Judges 5:4-5</a>.

Again, ver. 21, "I will shake the heavens and the earth" (cf. lea. 2:19, 21). The prophecy was uttered with reference to the second temple, the glory of which was to be greater than the glory of the first, in that it should be the scene of the LORD'S final revelation of himself to his people. Its first fulfillment is rightly seen in Christ's first coming (cf. <a href="/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>, "And in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts;" and <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple"). But the language used points evidently, even in itself, to a further fulfillment; nor do readers need to be reminded here of the pregnant and far-reaching sense of all Messianic prophecy. "Illustre est testimonium Psalm Newtoni ad Dan. p. 91: <span class="accented">vixque in omni V.T. aliquod de Christo extat vaticinium</span>, <span class="accented">quod non</span>, <span class="accented">aliquatenus saltem</span>, <span class="accented">secundum ejus ad-ventum respiciat"</span> (Bengel). The ultimate reference is what is seen dimly afar off in so many of the prophetic visions - the final dissolution of the whole present order of things, to be succeeded by the kingdom of eternal righteousness (cf. <a href="/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>, etc.). By the heaven that is to be shaken in that great day is meant, of course, not the eternal abode of God, but that which is created and visible (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 27). This final shaking is set against the local and typical shaking of Mount Sinai in two points of contrast - its extending to the whole creation, and its being once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>); and from the latter expression the removing of the things thus finally shaken is in the next verse inferred. This inference, though not following necessarily from the expression itself, is involved in the general drift of Haggai's prophecy, taken in connection with other cognate ones, in which an entirely new and heavenly order is pictured as rising over the ruins of the old (cf. <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>, referred to in <a href="/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7, 10, 13</a>, "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At that time</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
