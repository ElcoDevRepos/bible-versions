He is mentioned frequently in Paul's letters, often as a co-sender, indicating his importance in the early church. The phrase "our brother" highlights the familial bond among early Christians, emphasizing unity and shared faith. Timothy's release suggests he was previously imprisoned, a common experience for early Christian leaders due to persecution. This aligns with historical accounts of Roman hostility towards Christians. The mention of his release would have been encouraging news to the recipients, indicating God's providence and the resilience of the church.<p><b>If he arrives soon,</b><br>The conditional "if" suggests uncertainty about Timothy's travel plans, reflecting the challenges of ancient travel, which was often unpredictable due to weather, political unrest, or other factors. The early church relied heavily on personal visits for communication and encouragement, as letters were the primary means of long-distance communication. This phrase underscores the importance of fellowship and personal presence in the early Christian community, a theme echoed throughout the New Testament.<p><b>I will come with him to see you.</b><br>The author expresses a desire to visit the recipients, indicating a personal connection and pastoral concern. This reflects the itinerant nature of early Christian leaders who traveled to nurture and strengthen churches. The promise to come "with him" suggests a partnership in ministry, reminiscent of Jesus sending out disciples in pairs. This phrase also highlights the importance of community and mutual support in the Christian faith, as seen in other scriptures where believers are encouraged to gather together and support one another.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A close companion and mentee of the Apostle Paul, Timothy was a young pastor and leader in the early church.

It shows the family bond of believers, God&#8217;s faithfulness in delivering His servants, the humility of yielding plans to His timing, and the importance of embodied fellowship. Timothy&#8217;s release and the promised visit underscore the letter&#8217;s theme: in Christ, we serve, suffer, and rejoice together until we see each other&#8212;and ultimately see Him&#8212;face to face.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) It is clear that the Hebrew Christians knew of the imprisonment of Timothy, but had not heard the news of his release. In <a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-1.htm" title=" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,">Colossians 1:1</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,">Philemon 1:1</a>, Timothy is spoken of as "the brother;" in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1Thessalonians 3:2</a>, and here, as "our brother" (for the word "our" printed in italics in the Authorised version, belongs to the true text). With him, the writer adds, "if he come shortly [sooner than the date at which he himself must depart], I will see you."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</span> This allusion to Timothy shows that the Epistle, whatever its exact date, was at any rate written in the apostolic age, before his death. Further, though not proving St. Paul's authorship, it supports the conclusion that the writer, if not himself, was one of his associates, Timothy having been peculiarly his disciple and companion. It seems that Timothy had been, as the readers were aware, in prison; and the joyful news is communicated of his release, and of the prospect of his visiting them. This again shows that the Epistle was addressed to a definite circle of readers. It is observable that the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which does not occur in St. Paul's writings, is, like so many expressions throughout the Epistle, one usual with St. Luke (<a href="/luke/22-68.htm">Luke 22:68</a>; <a href="/luke/23-16.htm">Luke 23:16</a>, etc.; <a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="/acts/4-21.htm">Acts 4:21</a>; where it expresses release from prison or captivity). He uses it also for dismissal of persons on a mission (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>; <a href="/acts/15-30.htm">Acts 15:30</a>); and hence one view is that Timothy's having already set out to visit the Church addressed is all that is here meant. But the other meaning of the word is more likely. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/13-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Be aware [that]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#915;&#953;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Gin&#333;skete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;m&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
