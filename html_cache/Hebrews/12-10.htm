In the cultural context of the biblical era, discipline was a common practice in family life, often involving physical correction. The phrase "for a short time" highlights the temporary nature of parental discipline, which is limited to the years of childhood and adolescence. The phrase "as they thought best" acknowledges the imperfect and subjective nature of human judgment. This can be connected to <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>, which emphasizes the importance of discipline in child-rearing. The comparison here sets the stage for understanding the superior and perfect nature of God's discipline.<p><b>but God disciplines us for our good</b><br>This part of the verse contrasts human discipline with divine discipline. God's discipline is portrayed as inherently beneficial and purposeful. Unlike human parents, who may err in their judgment, God's discipline is always for the ultimate good of the believer. This aligns with <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, which assures that God works all things for the good of those who love Him. Theologically, this reflects the concept of sanctification, where God's discipline is a means of spiritual growth and maturity. It underscores the idea that God's actions are always motivated by love and a desire for the believer's well-being.<p><b>so that we may share in His holiness</b><br>The ultimate purpose of God's discipline is revealed here: to make believers partakers in His holiness. This is a profound theological statement about the transformative power of God's discipline. Holiness, in biblical terms, refers to being set apart for God's purposes and reflecting His character. This connects to <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, which calls believers to be holy as God is holy. The phrase suggests a process of becoming more like Christ, who is the ultimate example of holiness. It also points to the eschatological hope of being fully sanctified in the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers.htm">Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to earthly parents who discipline their children.

Think of <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>&#8212;&#8220;He who spares the rod hates his son.&#8221; The Bible assumes that loving parents correct their children because they truly care, echoing <a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>, where fathers are urged to &#8220;bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.&#8221; Parental discipline is meant to signal love, protection, and growth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for a short time</b><p>Human discipline is temporary. It lasts only as long as childhood and, even then, only for the brief span of life on earth. <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a> reminds us that our days &#8220;quickly pass, and we fly away.&#8221; By contrast, God&#8217;s dealings reach into eternity. This contrast prepares us to value His discipline far above any earthly correction, because His training extends beyond this fleeting life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as they thought best</b><p>Parents do their best, but they operate with limited wisdom. Sometimes they err or overreact. Even the best father on earth can misjudge a situation. Jesus acknowledged this limitation in <a href="/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11</a>: &#8220;If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children&#8230;&#8221; Human discipline, while necessary, is imperfect. This humbling comparison builds anticipation for the perfect wisdom of God&#8217;s discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but God disciplines us</b><p>Here the focus shifts to the perfect Parent. <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, quoted earlier in <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>, says, &#8220;For the LORD disciplines the one He loves.&#8221; Unlike our fathers, God never disciplines out of frustration or ignorance. His correction is always specific, wise, and suited to each child. <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a> affirms, &#8220;Those I love, I rebuke and discipline.&#8221; His hand is steady, never rash.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for our good</b><p>God&#8217;s purpose is always benevolent. <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> assures us that &#8220;all things work together for good to those who love God.&#8221; He does not delight in pain; He delights in our welfare. Consider Joseph&#8217;s perspective in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>&#8212;what others meant for evil, God meant for good. In every hardship, the Father is shaping Christlikeness, not merely punishing wrongdoing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that we may share in His holiness</b><p>The ultimate aim is participation in God&#8217;s own character. First Peter 1:15-16 calls believers to be holy because He is holy. Discipline is the divine means to this end. It refines us like gold in fire (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>) and prunes us so we bear more fruit (<a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>). The process may sting, yet it yields &#8220;the peaceful fruit of righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>). Holiness is not optional; it is the family likeness God is determined to see in every son and daughter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Earthly fathers correct for a brief season, doing the best they can with limited insight. God, the perfect Father, disciplines with flawless wisdom, always for our benefit, aiming to draw us into His own holiness. His loving correction is a sure sign we belong to Him and a guarantee that He is shaping us for eternity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">After their own pleasure.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">as seemed good unto them.</span> The contrast is continued here between human liability to mistake and the perfect knowledge of our heavenly Father, who seeks our profit, and cannot err in the means which He employs. There is a general resemblance between this verse and the last, the "few days" corresponding to the "fathers of our flesh;" and the last clause here, "that we may be partakers of His holiness," to the words which close <a href="/hebrews/12-9.htm" title="Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?">Hebrews 12:9</a>, "and live." To the "few days" no contrast is directly expressed in the second member of the verse; none was needed, because the last words so clearly imply the <span class= "ital">permanence</span> of the result.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</span> The <span class="accented">afortiori</span> argument is thus continued. The discipline of our earthly fathers was "for a few days," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> during our childhood only, since which we have been left to ourselves; and even then not necessarily for our greatest advantage; it was only as seemed good to them (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); it might be injudicious, or even capricious. But our heavenly Father's discipline we may trust to be always good for us, and with a definite final purpose. Though there is here no distinctly expressed antithesis to the "few days" of ordinary parental chastisement, yet one is implied in the last clause; for if God's purpose in chastening us is to make us partakers of his own holiness, we may conclude that the discipline will be continued till the end be attained; and thus also a further reason is implied why Christians should not "faint" under even lifelong trials. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Our fathers] disciplined [us]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#965;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epaideuon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3811.htm">Strong's 3811: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pais; to train up a child, i.e. Educate, or, discipline.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
