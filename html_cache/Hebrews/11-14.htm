These patriarchs expressed their faith through their actions and words, indicating their belief in God's promises. Their lives were testimonies of faith, as they lived as strangers and pilgrims on the earth, acknowledging that their true home was not in the present world. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of believers being sojourners in this world (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>).<p><b>show that they are seeking</b><br>The act of seeking implies a deliberate and ongoing effort. The patriarchs' lives demonstrated a continuous pursuit of something beyond their immediate circumstances. This seeking is not passive but active, reflecting a deep longing and anticipation for what God has promised. It echoes the biblical call to "seek first the kingdom of God" (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>), emphasizing the priority of spiritual over earthly pursuits.<p><b>a country of their own</b><br>The "country" they sought is not a physical land but a heavenly one, as clarified later in <a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>. This reflects the promise God made to Abraham of a land and a multitude of descendants, which was ultimately a shadow of the eternal inheritance believers have in Christ. The patriarchs' faith pointed to a future fulfillment beyond their lifetime, illustrating the concept of living by faith and not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).

In their history as given in Genesis, as, indeed, in the Old Testament generally (at any rate, in the earlier books), there <span class="accented">is, as is</span> well known, no distinct recognition of the life to come. The promise to Abraham seems to imply only an innumerable seed, its possession as a great nation of the earthly land of promise, and through it some undefined blessing to all the families of the earth. Nor are the patriarchs represented as looking forward to a fulfillment of the promise beyond the limits of the present world. Even so their history is singularly instructive. They lived in hope of things not seen through faith in the Divine promise. The very fact that they were content to die without themselves attaining, if so <span class="accented">God's</span> purpose might be accomplished to their seed, invests them with a peculiar grandeur of <span class="accented">unselfishness.</span> Their faith was essentially the same principle as that of Christians, even though the final object of Christian hope were hidden from their eyes; while their dwelling in tents as strangers, and the home and city seen afar off, are apt emblems of the present life and the heavenly citizenship of Christians. It may be that this is all that is intended in the Epistle, the history being allegorized, as that of Isaac and Ishmael is in the Epistle to the Galatians. If so, the apparent attribution of a heavenly hope to the patriarchs themselves must be accounted for by a blending of the actual history with its ideal meaning, such as was observed in the chapter about Melchizedek. But it is difficult to understand the expressions used as implying no more than this. Abraham is said to have himself looked for the "<span class="accented">city</span> that hath the foundations," of which God is the Builder - a description which cannot but denote the "<span class="accented">heavenly Jerusalem</span>," of which the city whose foundations were on the holy hills below is regarded elsewhere as but a type and emblem (cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-14.htm">Hebrews 13:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>; also <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="/hebrews/8-2.htm">Hebrews 8:2</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is said of the <span class="accented">heavenly</span> tabernacle). <span class="accented">This</span> interpretation is further supported by our finding in Philo similar views of a heavenly counterpart to Jerusalem as the final object of Israel's hope. Again, the country desired by the patriarchs is, in ver. 16, distinctly called a heavenly one. Nor is the view at all untenable that, notwithstanding the silence of the ancient record on the subject, they did look forward to a life after death with God, seeing in the promised earthly inheritance an emblem and earnest of a heavenly one. Well known is Bishop Warburton's argument that a belief in a future state, which was so ancient and universal, and so prominent especially in the religion of Egypt must almost of necessity have been shared in by the race of Abraham, and hence that the silence about it in the Mosaic record must be due, not to its absence from the creed of Israel, but to the peculiar purpose of the Mosaic dispensation. Worthy of attention also are Dean Stanley's words (Lect. 7. on 'Jewish Church') "Not from want of religion, but (if one might use the expression) from excess of religion, was this void left. The future life was not denied or contradicted, but it was overlooked, set aside, overshadowed, by the consciousness of the living, actual presence of God himself." But though such void there is, however to be accounted for, there are still, even in the Pentateuch (as certainly in the Psalms and prophets), occasional glimpses of the hope of immortality. The mystic tree of life in the midst of the garden, the predicted bruising, of the serpent's head, the mystery of Enoch's departure from the world, and notably (as our Lord himself points out) God still calling himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob after they had been long ago gathered to their fathers, are intimations, even in the Pentateuch, of a belief in man's immortal hopes. And it may be added, with reference to the history immediately before us, that Jacob's application of the idea of his being a" sojourner " - used by Abraham with reference to the abode in Palestine - to the whole course of his life upon the earth, in itself suggests the meaning attached to such language in the Epistle. Hence no violence is done to the meaning of the history rather it may be that its deeper meaning is brought out, if the patriarchs are regarded as entertaining a hope of a heavenly inheritance to themselves, and seeing beyond the earthly types. But even f we suppose such immortal hopes as having been in them at the most but vague and dim, still their faith in and longing for a fulfillment of the promise in any sense was really a longing and reaching after the eternal realities which the first fulfillment typified. Compare the view taken in <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4</a>. of the meaning of "<span class="accented">God's</span> rest." Delitzsch thus enunciates this view of the passage before us: "The promise given to the patriarchs was a Divine assurance of a future rest. That rest was connected, in the first instance, with the future possession of an earthly home; but their desire for that home was at the same time a longing and a seeking after Him who had given the promise of it, whoso presence and blessing alone made it for them an object of desire, and whose presence and blessing, however vouchsafed, makes the place of its manifestation to be indeed a heaven. The shell of their longing might thus be of earth; its kernel was heavenly and Divine, and as such God himself vouchsafed to honor and reward <span class="accented">it."</span> From the general mode of life of the patriarchs the review now passes to particular acts of faith, beginning with Abraham's memorable one, the offering of Isaac. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
