The imagery of "straight paths" is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26-27</a>, which advises believers to ponder the path of their feet and not turn to the right or left. In a biblical context, straight paths symbolize a life aligned with God's will, avoiding sin and distractions. The call to make paths straight can also be seen as a preparation for the coming of the Lord, similar to John the Baptist's mission in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>, where he prepares the way for Jesus by calling for repentance and righteousness.<p><b>so that the lame may not be disabled</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a communal responsibility among believers. The "lame" can be understood as those who are weak in faith or struggling spiritually. By living righteously and setting a good example, believers can help prevent others from stumbling or falling away from their faith. The imagery of lameness and healing is prevalent in the Gospels, where Jesus heals the physically lame, symbolizing spiritual restoration (e.g., <a href="/matthew/11-5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a>). The community's role is to support and uplift those who are weak, ensuring they do not become further hindered in their spiritual journey.<p><b>but rather healed</b><br>The ultimate goal of making straight paths is healing and restoration. This reflects the redemptive work of Christ, who came to heal the brokenhearted and set the captives free (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). Healing here is not just physical but spiritual, pointing to the transformative power of living a life in accordance with God's will. The church is called to be a place of healing, where believers support one another in their walk with Christ, leading to spiritual growth and maturity. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of redemption and restoration, where God desires to heal and restore His people to a right relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is unknown.

If the words be rendered, "that what is lame may not be turned out of the way, but may rather be healed," we cannot but feel that the two members are somewhat incongruous. It is probable, therefore, that the first verb here bears the meaning which it not unfrequently has in medical writers, <span class= "ital">be put out of joint.</span> Let the paths (or tracks) which you follow be straight, for crooked and uneven paths will make the limbs which are lame more helpless still; should nothing aggravate the hurt that has been received, it may soon be healed. In the application, the words are a warning against the shifting courses of men who are ready to turn aside from strict duty when persecution threatens, and seek to avert the danger by compliance with what they do not in heart approve. Whatever may be the result in the case of "the strong" (<a href="/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.">Romans 14:1</a>; 1 Corinthians 8), the example brings destruction on "the weak."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but that it rather be healed.</span> The ideas in this verse correspond to, and may be suggested by, those that follow in Isaiah the passage above referred to. For there too the prophet goes on to speak, among other things, of the lame leaping, and of a way of holiness along which none should err. But the words themselves are suggested by <a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (LXX.), the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> having been previously used for turning out of the way. It is observable that the words, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., are arranged so as to form an hexameter line. This may have been unintentional, but it is at any rate effective. Delitzsch remarks on it. "The duty to which the writer urges, his, readers is courageous self-recovery m Gods strength. The tone and language are elevated accordingly, and ver. 12 is like a trumpet-blast. It need not surprise us, then, if our author here turns poet, and proceeds in heroic measures." With regard to the purport of this verse, we observe that, while the figure of running is still continued, a new idea is introduced - that of pursuing a straight course with a view to others who are to follow on the same track. "That which is lame (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" denotes the weak and wavering brethren - the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, such as are referred to in <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. and <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. The expression well suits (specially those among the Hebrew Christians who halted between two opinions - between the Church and the synagogue (cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>;).
