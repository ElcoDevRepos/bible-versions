In the early Christian context, many were jailed for their beliefs, as seen in the experiences of Paul and Silas (<a href="/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23-25</a>). The call to "remember" implies an active, ongoing concern, not just a fleeting thought. The phrase "as if you were bound with them" suggests a profound identification with the sufferer, echoing the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>, where caring for prisoners is equated with serving Christ Himself. This reflects the body of Christ's interconnectedness, where if one member suffers, all suffer (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>).<p><b>and those who are mistreated as if you were suffering with them</b><br>This part of the verse extends the call to empathy beyond prisoners to all who are mistreated. The early church faced persecution, and this exhortation would have resonated deeply with believers who were marginalized or oppressed. The phrase "as if you were suffering with them" encourages believers to bear one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>), fostering a community of support and compassion. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who identified with the suffering and marginalized, and it reflects the prophetic call to justice and mercy found throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>). The emphasis on shared suffering also points to the example of Christ, who suffered for humanity and calls His followers to take up their cross (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

Whether or not sufferers themselves now, they must not be forgetful of those that are "As bound with them" seems best taken as expressing the sympathy of one member with another (cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33, 34</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>, "If one member suffer," etc.). "As being yourselves," etc., reminds them that they are still in the flesh, and so not only on this account bound to sympathize, but also liable themselves at any time to the like afflictions. Exhortations to personal purity and to contentedness follow next. Of the need, and prominence in the Epistles, of warnings against impurity see what was said on <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>). St. Paul is given to couple covetousness 'rod uncleanness together in his warnings, as cognate sins, and alike incompatible with the kingdom of God (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>, etc.; <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 5</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).
