This law included ceremonial, civil, and moral aspects, and was central to the covenant between God and Israel. The setting aside of this commandment signifies a transition from the old covenant to the new covenant established through Jesus Christ. This is consistent with the broader theme of Hebrews, which emphasizes the superiority of Christ's priesthood and covenant. The setting aside is not a dismissal of the law's value but an acknowledgment of its fulfillment in Christ, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, where Jesus states He came to fulfill the law.<p><b>because it was weak</b><br>The weakness of the law is not in its moral or ethical teachings but in its inability to bring about true spiritual transformation or provide a permanent solution for sin. The law could not perfect the conscience of the worshiper (<a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>) and was unable to make anyone righteous before God (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>). This weakness highlights the need for a better covenant, one that could offer complete redemption and transformation through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, as promised in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.<p><b>and useless</b><br>The term "useless" here underscores the law's inability to achieve the ultimate goal of reconciling humanity to God.

The sacrificial system, central to the law, was a shadow of the good things to come (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>), pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. The new covenant, established through Jesus' death and resurrection, renders the old system obsolete, as it provides a direct and eternal means of access to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

The verse reassures believers that they no longer approach God through a weak, temporary structure but through a strong and everlasting Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18, 19) The intimate connection between these two verses is obscured by the ordinary translation. They point out with greater fulness and clearness what is involved in the statement of <a href="/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a>. "For there is an annulling of a preceding commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness (for the Law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, by which we draw nigh unto God." (It must be borne in mind throughout that by the "commandment" is meant the ordinance <span class= "ital">which created the Levitical priesthood, </span>not the Law in general.) That Jesus was not made Priest according to a law of a carnal commandment (<a href="/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a>) involves the annulling of that commandment; in His becoming Priest according to a power of indissoluble life is involved the introduction of a better hope. This is the general meaning, but each division of the thought is expanded. The appointment of a different priest by the very authority on which the former commandment rested, the divine decree, showed that commandment to be of force no longer: as we have already seen (<a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>), this is because the commandment is weak and unprofitable--because the priesthood it creates cannot attain the end of its institution, which is to bring men into fellowship with God. The parenthesis, "for the Law made nothing perfect," points out that the weakness just spoken of corresponds to that imperfection which confessedly belongs to the earlier dispensation: even the Jew (who would have accounted a change of priestly line impossible) expected perfection only when Messiah should have appeared. When the earlier commandment is annulled, in its place there is brought in a better hope. The "better hope" stands connected with the "better covenant" (<a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>) and the "better promises" (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>). "And by this (better hope) we draw nigh unto God." The end of the priesthood therefore is attained. (See <a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>.) In the Law (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm" title="Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.">Leviticus 10:3</a>) the priests are "those who come nigh unto God," that is, in the service of the sanctuary: with a nobler meaning this name shall now belong to all God's people. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof</span> (for the Law made nothing perfect); <span class="cmt_word">but</span> [there is on the other hand] <span class="cmt_word">a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God</span>.

But two proofs are first to be given of Christ's priesthood being, unlike the Aaronic, thus eternally availing to bring us near to God.
