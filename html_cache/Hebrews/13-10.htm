In the context of Hebrews, the altar represents the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is both the high priest and the offering. This altar is not a physical structure but a spiritual reality, emphasizing the believer's access to God through Christ's atoning work. The concept of an altar is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, where altars were central to worship and sacrifice. However, the New Covenant altar is superior, as it is based on the once-for-all sacrifice of Jesus, fulfilling and surpassing the Old Testament sacrificial system.<p><b>from which those who serve at the tabernacle</b><br>This refers to the Levitical priests who served in the earthly tabernacle, performing rituals and sacrifices according to the Mosaic Law. The tabernacle was a temporary, movable structure used by the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings and later replaced by the temple in Jerusalem. The priests had specific duties and privileges, including eating portions of certain sacrifices. However, the author of Hebrews highlights the limitations of the Levitical priesthood and the tabernacle system, which were shadows of the heavenly realities fulfilled in Christ. The tabernacle and its services pointed forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who entered the heavenly sanctuary on behalf of believers.<p><b>have no right to eat.</b><br>This phrase underscores the exclusivity of the New Covenant altar. Those who continue to rely on the Old Covenant system, represented by the tabernacle, do not partake in the benefits of Christ's sacrifice. The right to "eat" symbolizes participation in the spiritual blessings and eternal life offered through Jesus. In the Old Testament, eating from the altar was a privilege for the priests, but in the New Covenant, all believers are invited to partake in the spiritual nourishment provided by Christ. This reflects the broader theme of Hebrews, which encourages believers to move beyond the old system and embrace the new and living way opened by Jesus. The imagery of eating also connects to the Lord's Supper, where believers remember and proclaim the Lord's death until He comes, signifying their participation in the New Covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

The verse calls every reader to leave the shadows and feed on the grace found only at the cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10, 11) "We need not such profitless teaching; we already have sustenance which is 'meat indeed,' by which the heart is established." According to the Law, the priests (they. who "serve the Tabernacle," see <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>) received for themselves a greater or smaller portion of the animals offered as peace-offerings and trespass-offerings; in some cases, also, the flesh of the sin-offerings fell to their lot (Leviticus 4, 5, 7, 23). When the high priest presented a sin-offering on his own behalf (<a href="/context/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3-12</a>), or for the congregation (<a href="/context/hebrews/13-13.htm" title="Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.">Hebrews 13:13-21</a>), he sprinkled some of the blood in the Holy Place in front of the veil; on the Day of Atonement alone was the blood taken within the veil into the Most Holy Place. In the case of these three offerings the priest received no part of the animal sacrificed; certain portions were burnt on the altar of burnt-offering, and the rest of the body was carried forth "without the camp," and wholly consumed by fire. Though the writer here speaks of animals whose blood is brought into <span class= "ital">the Holy Place</span> through the high priest, as an offering for sin, it is probable that (as in Hebrews 5-9) he has in thought the Day of Atonement only, so that here "the Holy Place" bears the sense of the "Holiest of all." (See Note on <a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:2</a>.) (It will be noted that throughout he uses the present tense; see the same Note). For us there is but one sacrifice for sin, the efficacy of which endures for ever (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12</a>): Jesus entering the Holiest Place for us in virtue of His own sacrifice has fulfilled the type contained in the high priest's sprinkling of the blood. But whereas those priests might not eat of their sin-offering, to us greater privilege is given; we feed on Him who was slain for us, whose flesh war for the life of the world (<a href="/context/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51-56</a>). We then (who are all "priests unto God") "have an altar of which," on the very principles of their Law, "they that serve the Tabernacle (see <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>) have no right to eat." The stress is laid on the <span class= "ital">sacrifice, </span>of which we eat, not upon the altar itself. If separately interpreted, the altar will be the place of sacrifice, the Cross. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</span> Here there is a plain allusion to the eating of offered sacrifices. If, then, there was no such allusion in the preceding verse, what is the connection of thought? It appears to be this: "Some would teach you that meats are of religious importance. Nay, but what are meats to us who have Christ himself for our spiritual food? This is our peculiar privilege, not shared by the very priests of the old dispensation." Then, in ver. 11, "That this is so is shown by the very symbolism of the Day of Atonement." Then, in ver. 12, "Let us, then, be well content to leave Judaism entirely, and cleave to Christ alone."
