It indicates a future event, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises. The repetition of "once more" suggests a finality and completeness in God's plan, pointing to the ultimate transformation of creation.<p><b>signify the removal of what can be shaken&#8212;</b><br>The concept of shaking implies judgment and purification. In biblical history, shaking often accompanies divine intervention, as seen in the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>) and the fall of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>). This removal signifies God's judgment on temporal and corruptible things, aligning with prophetic themes of eschatological renewal.<p><b>that is, created things&#8212;</b><br>Created things refer to the physical and temporal aspects of the world, which are subject to decay and change. This aligns with the biblical understanding of creation's groaning for redemption (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-22</a>). The distinction between created and eternal highlights the transient nature of the physical world compared to the permanence of God's kingdom.<p><b>so that the unshakable may remain.</b><br>The unshakable represents the eternal kingdom of God, which cannot be moved or destroyed. This echoes <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, where God's kingdom is described as everlasting. It also points to the security and permanence found in Christ, who is the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>) and the fulfillment of God's unchanging promises. The contrast between the shakable and unshakable underscores the hope and assurance believers have in the eternal inheritance through faith in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority who speaks and whose voice shakes the earth and heavens.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God first shook the earth when He gave the Law to Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_jerusalem.htm">Heavenly Jerusalem</a></b><br>The unshakable kingdom that believers are receiving, contrasting with the shakable earthly things.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The mediator of the Old Covenant, which was given at Mount Sinai.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of the unshakable kingdom, called to live in reverence and awe.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_temporary_vs._eternal.htm">Understanding the Temporary vs. Eternal</a></b><br>Recognize that the physical world and its systems are temporary and will be removed, while God's kingdom is eternal.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_an_eternal_perspective.htm">Living with an Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Focus on investing in what is eternal&#8212;faith, hope, love, and the kingdom of God&#8212;rather than temporary, material things.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_and_awe.htm">Reverence and Awe</a></b><br>Approach God with reverence, understanding the gravity of His power and the privilege of receiving an unshakable kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_faith.htm">Endurance in Faith</a></b><br>Be encouraged to endure trials and challenges, knowing that they are part of the process of shaking away the temporary to reveal the eternal.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_for_the_kingdom.htm">Gratitude for the Kingdom</a></b><br>Cultivate a heart of gratitude for being part of God's unshakable kingdom, which should influence our daily lives and decisions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_12_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 12:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_12_27_Eternal_vs_Temporary.htm">How does Hebrews 12:27 encourage us to prioritize eternal over temporary things?

(1) If upon "removing," the sense will be: This word . . . signifieth the removing of the things made (as being created things), that the things not shaken may remain. The next verse throws light on the writer's meaning; there that which "cannot be shaken" is the kingdom which we receive: he is not speaking of that which belongs to a material creation. (2) The other view can only be briefly mentioned: This word . . . signifieth the removing of the things shaken, as of things that have been made in order that the things not shaken may remain. The idea is striking--that created things were made for the very purpose of giving place to what shall abide; but the other view seems to give the more probable meaning of the verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
