The manifold successive partial disclosures of God's will have given place to one revelation, complete and final; for He who spake in the prophets hath now spoken "in a Son." The whole stress lies on these last words. The rendering "a Son" may at first cause surprise, but it is absolutely needed; not, "<span class= "ital">Who</span> is the Revealer?" but, <span class= "ital">"What</span> is He?" is the question answered in these words. The writer does not speak of <span class= "ital">a Son</span> in the sense of one out of many; the very contrast with the prophets (who in the lower sense were amongst God's sons) would be sufficient to prove this, but the words which follow, and the whole contents of this chapter, are designed to show the supreme dignity of Him who is God's latest Representative on earth. The prophet's commission extended no farther than the special message of his words and life; "a Son" spoke with His Father's authority, with complete knowledge of His will and purpose. It is impossible to read these first lines (in which the whole argument of the Epistle is enfolded) without recalling the prologue of the fourth Gospel. The name "Word" is not mentioned here, and the highest level of St. John's teaching is not reached; but the idea which "the Word" expresses, and the thought of the Only Begotten as declaring and interpreting the Father (<a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>; also <a href="/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a>; <a href="/john/14-24.htm" title="He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.">John 14:24</a>) are present throughout. There is something unusual in the words, "at the end of these days." St. Peter speaks of the manifestation of Christ "at the end of the times" (<a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>); and both in the Old Testament and in the New we not unfrequently read "at the end (or, <span class= "ital">in the last</span>) of the days." (See <a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm" title="Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,">2Peter 3:3</a>; <a href="/jude/1-18.htm" title="How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.">Jude 1:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-14.htm" title="And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.">Numbers 24:14</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-14.htm" title="Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.">Daniel 10:14</a>, &c.) The peculiarity of the expression here lies in "<span class= "ital">these</span> days." The ages preceding and following the appearance of Messiah are in Jewish writers known as "this world" (or, <span class= "ital">age</span>) and the "coming world" (or, <span class= "ital">age</span>); the "days of Messiah" seem to have been classed sometimes with the former, sometimes with the latter period; but "the end of these days" would be understood by every Jewish reader to denote the time of His appearing. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In these last days</span>.

A subject of discussion has been the point of division between the two ages - whether the commencement of the Christian dispensation, ushered in by the exaltation of Christ, or his second advent. The conception in the Jewish mind, founded on Messianic prophecy, would, of course, be undefined. It would only be that the coming of the Messiah would inaugurate a new order of things. But how did the New Testament writers after Christ's ascension conceive the two ages? Did they regard themselves as living at the end of the former age or at the beginning of the new one? The passage before us does not help to settle the question, nor does <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>; for the reference in both cases is to the historical manifestation of Christ before his ascension. But others of the passages cited above seem certainly to imply that "the coming age" was regarded as still future. It has been said, indeed, with regard to this apparent inference from some of them, that the writers were regarding their own age from the old Jewish standing-point when they spoke of it as future, or only used well-known phrases to denote the two ages, though they were no longer strictly applicable (see Alford's note on Hebrews 2:5). But this explanation cannot well be made to apply to such passages as <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>, or to those in the Gospels. It would appear from them that it was not till the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (or, as it is designated in the pastoral Epistles, the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) of Christ that "the coming age" of prophecy was regarded as destined to begin, ushering in "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (<a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). Still, though "that day" was in the future, the first coming of Christ had been, as it were, its dawn, signifying its approach and preparing believers for meeting it. "The darkness was passing away; the true light was already shining" (<a href="/1_john/2-8.htm">1 John 2:8</a>). Hence the apostolic writers sometimes speak as if already in the "coming age;" as being already citizens of heaven (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>); as already "made to sit with Christ in the heavenly places" (<a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>); having already "tasted the powers of the age to come" (<a href="/hebrews/6-5.htm">Hebrews 6:5</a>). In a certain sense they felt themselves in the new order of things, though, strictly speaking, they still regarded their own age as but the end of the old one, irradiated by the light of the new. To understand fully their language on the subject, we should remember that they supposed the second advent to be more imminent than it was. St. Paul, at one time certainly, thought that it might be before his own death (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). Thus they might naturally speak of their own time as the conclusion of the former age, though regarding the second advent as the commencement of the new one. But the prolongation of "the end of these days," unforeseen by them, does not affect the essence of their teaching on the subject. In the Divine counsels "one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." <span class="cmt_word">Hath spoken unto us</span> (more properly, <span class="accented">spake to us</span>) in his Son. "His" is here properly supplied to give the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span>. The rendering, a SON, which seems to have the advantage of literalism, would be misleading if it suggested the idea of one among many sons, or a son in the same sense in which others are sons. For though the designation, "son of God," is undoubtedly used in subordinate senses - applied <span class="accented">e.g.</span> to Adam, to angels, to good men, to Christians - yet what follows in the Epistle fixes its peculiar meaning here. The entire drift of the earlier part of the Epistle is to show that the idea involved in the word "Son," as applied to the Messiah in prophecy, is that of a relation to God far above that of the angels or of Moses, and altogether unique in its character. This idea must have been in the writer's mind when he selected the phrases of his exordium. Nor is the article required for the sense intended. Its omission, in fact, brings it out. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> would have drawn especial attention to "the <span class="accented">personage</span> in whom God spake; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> does so rather to the <span class="accented">mode</span> of the speaking - it is equivalent to "in one who was SON." Son-revelation (as afterwards explained), is contrasted with previous prophetic revelations (cf. for omission of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-28.htm">Hebrews 7:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whom he appointed</span> (or, <span class="accented">constituted</span>) heir of all things; not, as in the A.V., "hath appointed." The verb is in the aorist, and here the indefinite sense of the aorist should be preserved. "<span class="accented">Convenienter</span> statim sub Filii nomen memoratur haereditas" (Bengel). Two questions arise. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Was it in respect of his eternal Divinity, or of his manifestation in time, that the Son was appointed "Heir of all things?" <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When is God to be conceived as so appointing him? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> What is the time, if any, to be assigned to the indefinite aorist? In answer to question <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the second alternative is to be preferred. For <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> his eternal pre-existence has not yet been touched upon: it is introduced, as it were parenthetically, in the next and following clauses. <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Though the term Son is legitimately used in theology to denote the eternal relation to the Father expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of St. John, yet its application in this Epistle and in the New Testament generally (excepting, perhaps, the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> peculiar to St. John, on which see Bull, 'Jud. Eccl. Cath.,' 5:4, etc.), is to the Word made flesh, to the Son as manifested in the Christ. And hence it is to him as such that we may conclude the heirship to be here assigned. <p><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> This is the view carried out in the sequel of the Epistle, where the SON is represented as attaining the universal dominion assigned to him after, and in consequence of, his human obedience. The conclusion of the exordium in itself expresses this; for it is not till after he had made purification of sins that he is said to have "sat down," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> entered on his inheritance; having become (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>) "<span class="accented">so</span> much better," etc. This is the view of Chrysostom, Theodoret, and the Fathers generally (cf. the cognate passage, <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It seems best to refer the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, not to any definite time, as that of the prophetic utterances afterwards cited, or that of the actual exaltation of Christ, but indefinitely to the eternal counsels, which were indeed declared and fulfilled in time, but were themselves <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;</span>. A similar use of the aorist, coupled with other aorists pointing to events in time, is found in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29, 30</a>. What this heirship of all things implies will appear in the sequel, <span class="cmt_word">By whom also he made the worlds</span>. Interposed clause to complete the true conception of the SON; showing who and what he was originally and essentially through whom God "spake" in time, and who, as SON, inherited. Here certainly, and in the expressions which follow, we have the same doctrine as that of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of St. John. And the testimony of the New Testament to the pre-existence and deity of Christ is the more striking from our finding the same essential idea under different forms of expression, and in writings differing so much from each other in character and style. He who appeared in the world as Christ is, in the first place, here said (as by St. <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>) to have been the Agent of creation; cf. <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-17</a>, where the original creative agency of "the Son of his love" is emphatically set forth, as well as his being "the Head of the body, the Church." This cognate passage is of weight against the view of interpreters who would take the one before us as referring to the initiation of the gospel ages; with respect to which view see also the quotation from Bull given below under ver. 3. Here <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is equivalent to "the worlds," as in the A.V. For though the primary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> has reference to <span class="accented">time</span> - limited in periods, or unlimited in eternity - it is used to denote also the whole system of things called into being by the Creator in time and through which alone we are able to conceive time.
