In the context of the letter to the Hebrews, the audience is reminded of the impermanence of earthly cities, including Jerusalem, which was central to Jewish life and worship. Historically, Jerusalem had been destroyed and rebuilt multiple times, emphasizing its temporal nature. This idea is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who spoke of the temporary nature of earthly treasures (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). Theologically, this phrase underscores the Christian belief that believers are pilgrims on earth, with their true citizenship in heaven (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>).<p><b>but we are looking for the city that is to come</b><br>This phrase points to the eschatological hope of Christians, the anticipation of the New Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>. This city represents the fulfillment of God's promises and the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people. The "city that is to come" is a symbol of eternal life and the consummation of God's kingdom. It reflects the faith of the patriarchs, like Abraham, who looked forward to a city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God (<a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10</a>). This future city is characterized by permanence, peace, and the presence of God, contrasting with the temporary and often tumultuous nature of earthly cities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.
