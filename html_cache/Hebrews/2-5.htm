Angels are ministering spirits (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>) and serve a different purpose in the divine order. The author of Hebrews is addressing a Jewish audience familiar with the Old Testament, where angels often acted as messengers of God. However, the ultimate authority and dominion over creation are not given to them. This sets the stage for the argument that follows, highlighting the superiority of Christ and His role in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>that He has subjected</b><br>The use of "subjected" indicates a deliberate act of placing something under authority. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His intentional design for creation. In <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, humanity is given dominion over the earth, a role that is reaffirmed and expanded in the New Testament through Christ. The subjection here is part of God's ultimate plan for the world, which is fulfilled in Jesus.<p><b>the world to come</b><br>This phrase refers to the future age, often understood as the Messianic Kingdom or the new creation. In Jewish eschatology, the "world to come" is a time of restoration and fulfillment of God's promises. The New Testament expands on this, describing a new heaven and a new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). The "world to come" is characterized by the reign of Christ, where He exercises authority and believers share in His rule (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>).<p><b>about which we are speaking</b><br>The author of Hebrews is continuing a discourse that began in the previous chapter, focusing on the supremacy of Christ. The discussion is centered on the role of Jesus as the ultimate revelation of God, superior to angels and the old covenant. This phrase serves as a reminder to the audience that the subject at hand is the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through Christ, which is the central theme of the epistle.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God who serve as messengers and servants.

Scripture repeatedly keeps angels in a ministering role, while humans&#8212;redeemed in Christ&#8212;are promised authority (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-3.htm">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; By starting with &#8220;not to angels,&#8221; the writer underscores that the coming dominion is reserved for someone else, preparing us to look to Jesus and, in Him, to redeemed humanity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that He has subjected</b><p>&#8226; God alone grants and withdraws authority; the verb &#8220;has subjected&#8221; points to His sovereign decision (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5-6</a> says mankind was created &#8220;ruler of the works of Your hands,&#8221;

But the connection with <a href="/context/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2-3</a>, is equally important: "the salvation that is now given has been proclaimed not by angels but by the Lord, and it is God Himself who works with the messengers of the Lord; <span class= "ital">for</span> not unto angels," &c. The word "salvation" binds together this section and the first.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> does not in itself necessarily imply futurity from the writer's standpoint though, according to what was said above, the complete fulfilment of the prophetic anticipation is to be looked for in the second advent, whatever earnest and foretaste of it there may be already under the gospel dispensation.

And it is suitably used here with a view to the coming quotation from <a href="/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>, in which the primary idea is man's supremacy over the inhabited globe.
