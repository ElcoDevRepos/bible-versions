In the context of Hebrews, this refers to Jesus entering the heavenly sanctuary, symbolizing access to God. The concept of a forerunner is rooted in ancient practices where a scout or herald would go ahead to prepare the way for a king or army. Biblically, this connects to John the Baptist preparing the way for Jesus (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2-3</a>). Jesus' role as a forerunner assures believers of their future access to God's presence, as He has already paved the way. The phrase "on our behalf" emphasizes the substitutionary nature of Jesus' work, aligning with the broader New Testament theme of Jesus as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>He has become a high priest forever</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the eternal nature of Jesus' priesthood. Unlike the Levitical priests who served temporarily and were subject to death, Jesus' priesthood is perpetual. This eternal aspect is crucial because it assures believers of a constant intercessor before God. The concept of a high priest is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, where the high priest was the only one allowed to enter the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). Jesus surpasses this by offering a once-for-all sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>), fulfilling and transcending the Old Testament sacrificial system.<p><b>in the order of Melchizedek.</b><br>Melchizedek is a mysterious figure who appears in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a> as the king of Salem and priest of God Most High. His priesthood is unique because it predates the Levitical priesthood and is not based on lineage. <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> prophesies a priesthood "in the order of Melchizedek," which the author of Hebrews applies to Jesus, indicating a superior and eternal priesthood. Melchizedek's lack of genealogy in the biblical record symbolizes an eternal priesthood, which is fulfilled in Christ. This connection emphasizes Jesus' superiority over the Levitical priests and His role as both king and priest, uniting the two offices in a way that was not possible under the Old Covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, the Son of God, who serves as our forerunner and high priest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A mysterious figure from the Old Testament, king of Salem and priest of God Most High, who blesses Abraham.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>In Jewish tradition, the high priest was the chief religious leader, responsible for making sacrifices on behalf of the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/order_of_melchizedek.htm">Order of Melchizedek</a></b><br>A unique priestly order that predates the Levitical priesthood, signifying an eternal and superior priesthood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/forerunner.htm">Forerunner</a></b><br>A term indicating someone who goes ahead to prepare the way, in this context, Jesus entering the heavenly sanctuary on our behalf.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_as_our_forerunner.htm">Jesus as Our Forerunner</a></b><br>Jesus has gone ahead of us into the heavenly sanctuary, preparing a place for us and ensuring our access to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_eternal_priesthood_of_christ.htm">The Eternal Priesthood of Christ</a></b><br>Unlike the Levitical priests, whose service was temporary, Jesus' priesthood is eternal, offering us a permanent intercession.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_melchizedek.htm">The Significance of Melchizedek</a></b><br>Melchizedek's priesthood points to a higher order, one that is not based on genealogy but on divine appointment, highlighting the uniqueness of Christ's priesthood.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Jesus' role as high priest assures us of our salvation, as He continually intercedes for us before the Father.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_confidence.htm">Living with Confidence</a></b><br>Knowing that Jesus is our high priest should give us confidence to approach God with boldness and live out our faith with assurance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_6_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 6:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Jesus_as_forerunner_on_salvation.htm">How does Jesus being a "forerunner" impact our understanding of salvation's assurance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_eternal_high_priest_role_s_impact.htm">What does Jesus' role as "high priest forever" mean for our daily faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_6_20_link_to_OT_priesthood.htm">How does Hebrews 6:20 connect to Old Testament priesthood and Melchizedek?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_mirror_Jesus_priestly_role.htm">In what ways can we emulate Jesus' priestly role in our communities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_priesthood_boost_spiritual_grit.htm">How does Jesus' eternal priesthood encourage perseverance in our spiritual journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Jesus_as_forerunner_in_Heb_6_20.htm">What does Hebrews 6:20 mean by Jesus being a "forerunner"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Link_of_Jesus_to_Melchizedek_in_Heb_6_20.htm">How does Hebrews 6:20 connect Jesus to the order of Melchizedek?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Jesus_as_high_priest.htm">Why is the concept of Jesus as high priest significant in Hebrews 6:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_hebrews_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Hebrews 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_is_melchizedek,_and_his_lineage.htm">Genesis 14:18: Who is Melchizedek, and why is there no clear historical or biblical lineage to verify his existence?
