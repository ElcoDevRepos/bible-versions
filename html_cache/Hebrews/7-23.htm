This system required a succession of priests because no single priest could serve indefinitely. The priesthood was hereditary, passed down through the line of Aaron, and each priest served for a limited time. This phrase highlights the multiplicity and temporality of the Levitical priesthood, contrasting it with the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ. The many priests served as mediators between God and the people, offering sacrifices and performing rituals as prescribed in the Law.<p><b>since death prevented them</b><br>The mortality of the priests is a significant limitation of the Levitical system. Each priest, being human, was subject to death, which interrupted their service. This mortality underscores the imperfection and incompleteness of the old covenant priesthood. The priests' inability to continue indefinitely points to the need for a greater, eternal priesthood. This limitation is contrasted with the eternal life of Jesus, who, as the resurrected High Priest, lives forever to intercede for believers.<p><b>from continuing in office</b><br>The office of the priest was one of great responsibility and honor, but it was temporary due to the inevitability of death. The priesthood required continuity, which was disrupted each time a priest died. This phrase emphasizes the transient nature of the Levitical priesthood and the need for a permanent solution. In contrast, Jesus' priesthood is unending, as He holds His office eternally. This permanence fulfills the prophecy of a priest in the order of Melchizedek, as mentioned in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, and provides believers with a constant and unchanging mediator before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_priests.htm">Levitical Priests</a></b><br>The verse refers to the priests from the tribe of Levi who served in the temple.
