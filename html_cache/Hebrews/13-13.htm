The "therefore" connects this exhortation to the preceding verses, which discuss Jesus' suffering outside the city gate. It implies a response to His sacrifice. The call to "go to Him" suggests a personal and communal journey of faith, emphasizing the need for believers to actively pursue a relationship with Christ, who is the ultimate high priest and mediator.<p><b>outside the camp</b><br>"Outside the camp" refers to the place of rejection and exclusion, reminiscent of the Old Testament practice where the unclean and sacrificial animals were taken outside the Israelite camp (<a href="/leviticus/16-27.htm">Leviticus 16:27</a>). This symbolizes separation from the established religious system and societal norms. Jesus was crucified outside Jerusalem, signifying His rejection by the religious authorities and His role as the ultimate sin offering (<a href="/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17-20</a>). Believers are called to identify with Christ's suffering and rejection, embracing a life that may be countercultural and outside the mainstream.<p><b>bearing the disgrace He bore</b><br>This phrase highlights the call to share in Christ's sufferings and the shame associated with His crucifixion. In the Roman world, crucifixion was a humiliating and disgraceful death reserved for the worst criminals. By bearing the same disgrace, believers are reminded of the cost of discipleship and the willingness to endure persecution and scorn for the sake of Christ (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29</a>). This also reflects the prophetic imagery of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who bore the sins and shame of many. The call is to embrace this identity, finding honor in what the world deems disgraceful, as a testament to faith and commitment to Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the one who suffered "outside the camp," symbolizing His crucifixion outside the city walls of Jerusalem.
