This new covenant is characterized by an internal transformation, where God's laws are written on the hearts of His people, contrasting with the old covenant given at Sinai, which was external and written on stone tablets. The new covenant is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who, through His death and resurrection, establishes a direct and personal relationship between God and believers, transcending the limitations of the old covenant.<p><b>He has made the first one obsolete</b><br>The "first one" refers to the Mosaic Covenant, which included the Law given to Moses on Mount Sinai. This covenant was based on adherence to the Law and was a shadow of the good things to come (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>). With the coming of Christ, the sacrificial system and ceremonial laws of the old covenant are rendered obsolete because Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling the Law's requirements (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The obsolescence of the old covenant signifies a shift from the law-based relationship to a grace-based relationship with God.<p><b>and what is obsolete and aging</b><br>The language of "obsolete and aging" suggests a process of fading away, much like an old garment that is wearing out. This imagery is used to describe the transition from the old covenant to the new. The old covenant, with its rituals and sacrifices, was temporary and pointed forward to the coming of Christ. As the early church grew, the practices of the old covenant were increasingly seen as unnecessary for salvation, as the new covenant provided a more complete and perfect way to relate to God.<p><b>will soon disappear</b><br>The phrase "will soon disappear" indicates the imminent end of the old covenant system. Historically, this was realized with the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in AD 70, which effectively ended the Jewish sacrificial system. This event underscored the transition to the new covenant, where the focus is on the spiritual temple, the body of Christ, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). The disappearance of the old covenant practices highlights the sufficiency and finality of Christ's work on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The mediator of the new covenant, whose sacrifice and resurrection established a new relationship between God and humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_covenant.htm">The Old Covenant</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, which included ceremonial, moral, and civil laws.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_covenant.htm">The New Covenant</a></b><br>Instituted by Jesus, it is based on grace and faith, fulfilling the promises of the Old Testament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original recipients of the Old Covenant, whose history and relationship with God are foundational to understanding the transition to the New Covenant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in the first century who were navigating the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_obsolescence.htm">Understanding Obsolescence</a></b><br>The term "obsolete" (Greek: pepalai?ken) indicates that the old covenant is no longer effective or necessary because of the new covenant established by Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>The new covenant fulfills the promises made in the Old Testament, demonstrating God's faithfulness and the continuity of His plan for salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_under_grace.htm">Living Under Grace</a></b><br>Believers are called to live under the grace of the new covenant, which emphasizes faith and the transformative work of the Holy Spirit rather than adherence to the law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_law.htm">The Role of the Law</a></b><br>While the old covenant is obsolete, the moral truths of the law still reflect God's character and guide believers in righteous living.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/embracing_the_new_covenant.htm">Embracing the New Covenant</a></b><br>Christians are encouraged to fully embrace the new covenant, which offers a direct and personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_8_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 8:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_8_13_New_vs_Old_Covenant.htm">How does Hebrews 8:13 define the "new covenant" in relation to the old?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_obsolete_covenant_on_Christians.htm">What implications does the "obsolete" covenant have for Christian living today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Hebrews_8_13_Jeremiah_31_31-34.htm">How does Hebrews 8:13 connect with Jeremiah 31:31-34 about the new covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_embrace_the_new_covenant_daily_2.htm">In what ways can we embrace the "new covenant" in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Heb_8_13_on_God_s_bond_with_us.htm">How should Hebrews 8:13 influence our understanding of God's evolving relationship with humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_8_13_Old_vs_New_Covenant.htm">How does Hebrews 8:13 define the relationship between the Old and New Covenants?

The very mention of a new covenant had even then antiquated the other. It thenceforth survived only under the category of <span class="accented">old</span> as opposed to <span class="accented">new</span>; and further marked with the growing decrepitude which is the precursor of dissolution. This further idea is expressed by the present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (elsewhere applied to garments that are wearing out; cf. <a href="/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>; <a href="/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>), and also by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a figure taken from the advance of old age in men. When the Epistle was written, it would not have been spoken of as "waxing old," but as defunct. The temple, indeed, was still standing, with the old ritual going on; but it had become but as the stately shrine of a lifeless thing. As to the view of the antiquation having begun even in the prophetic age, we observe that the prophets themselves show a consciousness of this, in that their growing tendency is to depreciate rather than exalt the ceremonial Law, and to put mercy above sacrifice. In fact, the Old Testament itself, especially in its later parts, is replete with the principles of the new covenant, anticipated in part, though not to be fully revealed till Christ appeared. And so, when he did appear, the old dispensation had already become obsolete, and the new one prepared for; to be rejected in Israel by those only who, "in the reading of the Old Testament," had "the veil upon their heart." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/8-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
