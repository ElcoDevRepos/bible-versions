Faith is a central theme in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, often referred to as the "Faith Chapter." It highlights the belief in things not seen, aligning with the definition of faith in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>. This understanding is not based on empirical evidence but on trust in God's revelation.<p><b>that the universe was formed</b><br>The term "universe" refers to all of creation, encompassing both the heavens and the earth. This aligns with the Genesis account of creation, where God speaks the universe into existence. The formation of the universe is a testament to God's power and sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>, which states, "By the word of the LORD the heavens were made."<p><b>at God&#8217;s command</b><br>This phrase underscores the power of God's word. The creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> repeatedly uses the phrase "And God said," illustrating that creation was an act of divine will and command. The concept of God's word as powerful and creative is echoed in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where Jesus, the Word, is described as the agent of creation.<p><b>so that what is seen</b><br>This refers to the physical, visible world. The visible creation is a reflection of God's invisible attributes, as stated in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, which explains that God's eternal power and divine nature are understood through what has been made.<p><b>was not made out of what was visible</b><br>This phrase highlights the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, meaning "out of nothing." It affirms that God did not use pre-existing materials to create the universe, contrasting with ancient creation myths that often involved gods shaping chaos. This concept is foundational to understanding God's omnipotence and the nature of faith, as believers trust in the unseen and the power of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who, by His command, formed the universe.

Understanding creation by faith anchors our worldview, fuels our worship, and fortifies our trust that the God who formed worlds can shape our present and future.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Through faith.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">By faith, </span>as in the following verses. The first place is not given to "the elders," for the writer's object is to set forth the achievements of <span class= "ital">faith.</span> With these, he would say, the Scripture record is filled. Even where there is no mention of this principle we must trace it in the lives of God's servants; even where there is no history of men, there is a necessity for the exercise of faith by ourselves, and the first words of Scripture teach this lesson.<p><span class= "bld">That the worlds were framed.</span>--Literally, that <span class= "ital">the ages have been prepared.</span> The remarkable expression which was used in <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a> is here repeated. The complete preparation of all that the successive periods of time contain is the idea which the words present. The narrative of the first chapter of Genesis ascribes the whole creation of "the heaven and the earth" to God; and associates with "a word of God" every stage in the preparation and furnishing of the earth. (See Note on <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>.) This is the first lesson of that record. But it does not stand alone, as is taught more plainly still by the next clause.<p><span class= "bld">So that things which are seen.</span>--A slight alteration in the Greek is necessary here--"the thing seen" (or "what is seen") being the true reading. A more important point is a change in the aspect of the whole clause, which the Greek seems to require. As the English words stand, they point out the significance of the statement of Scripture respecting the creative act: we believe the writer intended rather <span class= "ital">to</span> state the divine <span class= "ital">purpose</span> in relation to that first creation and all subsequent acts that are included in the "preparing of the ages." "In order that what is seen should not have come into being out of things which appear." This is probably the true meaning of the clause. In the narrative of the first chapter of Genesis God would have us learn a lesson for the whole course of human history and development. As the visible universe did not take its being out of what was apparent, so what from time to time is seen does not arise of itself out of what is manifest to man's natural perceptions. Not only is the eternity of matter denied, but from the beginning a warning has been given against a materialistic philosophy. The first page of Scripture is designed to teach the constant presence and work of the Creator. This lesson we learn and apply by faith; and the result of its application is seen in many points of the history which follows. In that history the operation of faith is twofold. The writer's most obvious design is to call attention to the faith possessed by "the elders," and its wonderful triumphs; but it is in many cases by the same faith that we interpret the Scripture record so as to discover this to have been their guiding principle. But seldom does the Old Testament directly speak of faith, and hence the importance of this verse (which some have thought incongruous, since it retards the exhibition of the elders' faith) as throwing light on our interpretation of the teaching of God's word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith we perceive that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen</span> (or, <span class="accented">that which is seen</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>have</span> (or, <span class="accented">has</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>not been made of things which do appear.</span> "By the word of God" has reference to "and God said," of <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, which chapter enunciates the primary article of all definite religions faith, viz. the existence and operation of God, as the unseen Author of the visible universe. Even without a revelation to declare this, faith's office is to apprehend it from observation of the phenomena themselves; as is intimated in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where even to the Greek "<span class="accented">the</span> invisible things of God from the creation of the world" are said to be "clearly seen, being understood [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>: cf <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the passage before us] by the things that are made, <span class="accented">even</span> his eternal power and Godhead." The drift of both passages is the same, viz. this, and no more - that faith recognizes an unseen power and Godhead behind, and accounting for, the seen universe.
