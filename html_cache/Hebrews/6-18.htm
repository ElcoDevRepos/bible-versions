In the context of Hebrews, this is a reference to God's promise to Abraham, which is foundational for understanding God's faithfulness. The unchangeable nature of these things underscores the certainty and reliability of God's word, reflecting the immutability of His character. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where God's promises are seen as steadfast and eternal (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><b>in which it is impossible for God to lie</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the absolute truthfulness of God, a key attribute of His divine nature. The impossibility of God lying is a foundational belief that assures believers of the reliability of His promises. This is consistent with other scriptural affirmations of God's truthfulness, such as <a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>. The cultural context of the time, where oaths and promises were binding, further highlights the significance of God's unbreakable word.<p><b>we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us</b><br>The imagery of fleeing suggests urgency and a need for refuge, reminiscent of the cities of refuge in the Old Testament (<a href="/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6-7</a>). Believers are depicted as seeking safety and security in the hope provided by God. This hope is not a vague wish but a confident expectation based on God's promises. The "hope set before us" is a central theme in Hebrews, pointing to the future fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ.<p><b>may be strongly encouraged</b><br>The encouragement comes from the assurance of God's promises and the hope believers have in Christ. This phrase speaks to the pastoral concern of the author of Hebrews, who seeks to strengthen and reassure the faith of the recipients. The historical context of persecution and trials faced by early Christians makes this encouragement particularly poignant. The strong encouragement is rooted in the certainty of God's promises and the work of Christ, as seen throughout the book of Hebrews.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose nature and promises are unchangeable and truthful.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipients_of_hebrews.htm">The Recipients of Hebrews</a></b><br>Early Christians, likely Jewish converts, who are being encouraged to hold fast to their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hope_set_before_us.htm">The Hope Set Before Us</a></b><br>Refers to the promise of salvation and eternal life through Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oath_and_promise.htm">The Oath and Promise</a></b><br>The two unchangeable things mentioned, which are God's promise and His oath, emphasizing His reliability.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_refuge.htm">The Refuge</a></b><br>Symbolic of the safety and assurance found in God's promises, akin to the cities of refuge in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_immutability_of_god.htm">The Immutability of God</a></b><br>God's nature and promises are unchangeable.
