This phrase likely refers to the persecution of prophets and righteous individuals who stood firm in their faith. A notable example is Zechariah, who was stoned to death in the temple court (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</a>). This method of execution underscores the severity of opposition faced by those who remained faithful to God.<p><b>They were sawed in two</b><br>This phrase is traditionally associated with the prophet Isaiah, who, according to Jewish tradition, was martyred by being sawn in half during the reign of King Manasseh. Although not explicitly mentioned in the Bible, this tradition highlights the extreme suffering endured by some prophets. It serves as a testament to their unwavering commitment to God's message, even in the face of brutal persecution.<p><b>They were put to death by the sword</b><br>Execution by the sword was another form of capital punishment in ancient times. This phrase may refer to various prophets and faithful individuals who were killed for their beliefs. The prophet Uriah, for example, was struck down by the sword for prophesying against Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>). This method of execution illustrates the violent opposition faced by those who proclaimed God's truth.<p><b>They went around in sheepskins and goatskins</b><br>Wearing sheepskins and goatskins signifies a life of poverty and rejection. Prophets like Elijah and John the Baptist are known for their austere lifestyles, often wearing simple garments made from animal skins (<a href="/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>, <a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>). This attire symbolizes their separation from worldly comforts and their dedication to a prophetic mission, often at the cost of personal hardship.<p><b>Destitute, oppressed, and mistreated</b><br>These words paint a picture of the harsh realities faced by the faithful. Destitution indicates a lack of basic necessities, while oppression and mistreatment suggest ongoing persecution and injustice. This description aligns with the experiences of many prophets and righteous individuals throughout biblical history, who often faced societal rejection and hostility. Their endurance serves as an example of steadfast faith in the face of adversity, echoing the trials faced by Jesus Christ and His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_and_martyrs.htm">Prophets and Martyrs</a></b><br>This verse refers to the unnamed prophets and martyrs of the Old Testament who suffered persecution and death for their faith. Tradition holds that Isaiah was sawed in two, and other prophets faced similar fates.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The context of these events is primarily within ancient Israel, where prophets often faced hostility from kings and the people for delivering God's messages.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution.htm">Persecution</a></b><br>The verse highlights the severe persecution faced by God's faithful servants, emphasizing their endurance and faith despite extreme adversity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_adversity.htm">Faith in Adversity</a></b><br>The faith of these individuals was not deterred by persecution.

Christians should be prepared for the cost of discipleship, understanding that their reward is eternal.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite their suffering, these individuals were commended for their faith.

While <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a> only records &#8220;very much innocent blood&#8221; shed by Manasseh, the inclusion here verifies that such horrors truly befell God&#8217;s prophets. <a href="/james/5-10.htm">James 5:10</a> urges believers to &#8220;take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord as an example of suffering and patience,&#8221; reminding us that even grisly deaths cannot nullify God&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were put to death by the sword</b><p>Elijah lamented that Israel had &#8220;killed Your prophets with the sword&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>).

Each phrase underscores that authentic faith often collides head-on with a hostile world. Yet Scripture consistently shows that such trials neither surprise God nor thwart His plan. Instead, they testify that His servants value eternal reward above present ease, echoing Jesus&#8217; call to &#8220;take up your cross and follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">They were stoned.</span>--As Zechariah (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/24-20.htm" title="And the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said to them, Thus said God, Why transgress you the commandments of the LORD, that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.">2Chronicles 24:20-22</a>), and--according to a Jewish tradition mentioned by Tertullian and others--Jeremiah. (See <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!">Matthew 23:37</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">They were sawn asunder.</span>--An ancient tradition, mentioned both by Jewish and by early Christian writers, relates that Isaiah was thus put to death by order of Manasseh. The following words, "they were tempted," are very remarkable in such a position; and many conjectures have been hazarded on the supposition that a mistake of transcription has occurred. If the text is correct, the writer is speaking of the promises and allurements by which the persecutors sought to overcome the constancy of God's servants.<p><span class= "bld">Slain with the sword.</span>--See <a href="/1_kings/19-1.htm" title="And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and with how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.">1Kings 19:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.">1Kings 19:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm" title="And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.">Jeremiah 26:23</a>. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They were stoned,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#955;&#953;&#952;&#940;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Elithasth&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3034.htm">Strong's 3034: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stone, pelt with stones.
