In ancient Jewish culture, genealogy was crucial for establishing one's identity and legitimacy, especially for priests, who were required to be descendants of Aaron. The absence of Melchizedek's genealogy suggests a priesthood that is not based on hereditary lines, prefiguring the eternal priesthood of Christ, who is not a priest by descent but by divine appointment.<p><b>Without beginning of days or end of life</b><br>Melchizedek's lack of recorded birth or death in the biblical narrative symbolizes an eternal existence. This is not to suggest that Melchizedek was literally eternal, but rather that his priesthood is portrayed as timeless, foreshadowing the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ. In contrast to the Levitical priests, who served for a limited time due to death, Christ's priesthood is everlasting, as affirmed in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, which is a messianic prophecy about an eternal priesthood.<p><b>Like the Son of God</b><br>Melchizedek is presented as a type of Christ, serving as a foreshadowing or prefiguration of Jesus. The comparison emphasizes the unique and superior nature of Christ's priesthood. Just as Melchizedek was both a king and a priest, Jesus is both the King of Kings and our High Priest. This typology underscores the belief that the Old Testament contains shadows and types that find their fulfillment in the New Testament revelation of Jesus.<p><b>He remains a priest for all time</b><br>This phrase underscores the permanence and superiority of Melchizedek's priesthood, which is a type of Christ's eternal priesthood. Unlike the temporary and successive nature of the Levitical priesthood, Christ's priesthood is unending. <a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a> further elaborates on this, stating that Jesus holds His priesthood permanently and is able to save completely those who come to God through Him. This eternal priesthood assures believers of continual intercession and access to God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A mysterious figure in the Bible, Melchizedek is described as the king of Salem and priest of God Most High.

The silence about Melchizedek&#8217;s origins is Scripture&#8217;s way of shouting that the Son of God is the once-for-all, never-ending High Priest who secures our salvation forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Without father, without mother, without descent.</span>--The last words, "without descent" (or rather, <span class= "ital">without genealogy</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>throw light on the meaning of those which precede. Not because we find no mention of the parents of Melchizedek is he thus spoken of as fatherless and motherless, but because he is suddenly introduced as priest, without any token whatever that he held the office by right of genealogy, the only claim familiar to Hebrew readers. It is not necessary to adduce proof of the care with which inquiry was made into the parentage of the Jewish priests (<a href="/nehemiah/7-64.htm" title="These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.">Nehemiah 7:64</a>): in their marriages they were subject to strict restraints (<a href="/context/leviticus/21-13.htm" title="And he shall take a wife in her virginity.">Leviticus 21:13-14</a>); their statement of pedigree (in which was given the name not of father only, but also of every mother) must be complete, ascending to Aaron, and containing no doubtful link. He who is a priest "like Melchizedek" holds a priesthood that rests on no such rights or claims. The words that follow are of similar character. No commencement and no close of priestly position or function are recorded in the sacred history. As the Scripture is silent as to his reception of the office, so also as to any transmission of it to another. In these respects "made like (as a divinely ordained type) unto the Son of God," he bears perpetually the character of priest.<p>There have from the first been many who have been dissatisfied with such an explanation of these remarkable words, and have understood them to ascribe to Melchizedek a mysterious and superhuman existence and character. It has been maintained that he was the Son of God Himself, or the Holy Spirit,--an angel or a Power of God. The last tenet was the distinguishing mark of a sect bearing the name of Melchizedekians in the third century. The feeling that the most startling of the expressions here used must surely be intended to point to more than the <span class= "ital">silence</span> of Scripture on certain points, is not at all unnatural; but perhaps it is not too much to say that every such difficulty is removed by the consideration that here the writer is simply analysing the thought of the inspired Psalmist. Such an oracle as that of <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a> must yield up to him its full significance. The divine words are not to be measured by the meaning which man may at first assign to them. The true import of the prophecy which declared that the future priesthood would bear the likeness of Melchizedek's can only be known when all the characteristics of that priesthood have been traced. The narrative of Genesis was the basis of the prophecy; all that the history presented was taken up in the Psalm.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/7-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Without father</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(apat&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_540.htm">Strong's 540: </a> </span><span class="str2">Without (recorded) father, of unknown father.
