In the New Testament, this is applied to Christ, emphasizing His authority over all things. The imagery of placing everything under one's feet signifies complete subjugation and control, a common motif in ancient Near Eastern cultures where a king's enemies were depicted as footstools. This highlights Christ's ultimate victory and authority over all creation, including spiritual realms (<a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>).<p><b>When God subjected all things to him,</b><br>This refers to the divine act of granting Jesus authority over all creation. It aligns with the messianic prophecy in <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, where the Son of Man is given dominion and glory. The subjection of all things to Christ is part of God's redemptive plan, affirming His sovereignty and the fulfillment of His purposes through Jesus. This also connects to <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>, where Paul discusses the subjection of all things under Christ, emphasizing His role in God's ultimate plan.<p><b>He left nothing outside of his control.</b><br>This statement underscores the comprehensive nature of Christ's authority. There is no aspect of creation, whether physical or spiritual, that is beyond His dominion. This reflects the belief in Christ's omnipotence and His role as sustainer of the universe (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). It reassures believers of Christ's power and the certainty of His ultimate victory over evil.<p><b>Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.</b><br>This acknowledges the current reality where the full manifestation of Christ's authority is not yet visible. It reflects the "already but not yet" tension in Christian eschatology, where Christ's victory is assured but not fully realized in the present world. This is a call to faith and hope, trusting in the eventual fulfillment of God's promises despite present circumstances. It resonates with the themes in <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22-25</a>, where creation awaits its full redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who has subjected all things under the authority of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son of God, to whom all things have been subjected, though this is not yet fully visible in the present world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>The current state of creation, which is not yet fully under the visible dominion of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul or another early Christian leader, addressing Jewish Christians to affirm the supremacy of Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipients.htm">The Recipients</a></b><br>Early Jewish Christians who were familiar with the Old Testament and needed encouragement in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_christ.htm">The Sovereignty of Christ</a></b><br>Christ's authority is comprehensive, though not yet fully visible.

For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing unsubjected to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him."<p><span class= "bld">For in that . . .</span>--The assertion of <a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm" title="For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.">Hebrews 2:5</a> is established by this Scripture; for if God has thus declared <span class= "ital">all things</span> subject to man, there is nothing that did not fall under his rule. "<span class= "ital">Did</span> not," in the divine purpose; but this purpose is not yet fulfilled in regard to the race of man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all things in subjection under him</span>, etc. Here the argument from the psalm begins. It is to the following effect: <span class="accented">For</span> the subjection of <span class="accented">all things</span>, in the Creator's design, to man leaves nothing exempted from his sovereignty. <span class="accented">But</span> we do not see man, as he is upon earth now, occupying this implied position of complete sovereignty. <span class="accented">Therefore</span> the full idea of the psalm awaits fulfillment. And we Christians find its complete fulfillment in him who, having become a man like us, and is made with us "a little lower than the angels," is now, as man, and for man, "crowned with glory and honor," at the right hand of the Majesty on high. Or we may put it thus: In the present <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> man is not supreme over "all things" in the sense denoted; but in the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> to come "of which we speak," with its far wider bearings, he is, in the Person of Christ, over "all things" thus supreme. Therefore in Christ alone does man attain his appointed destiny. We may here observe how, even without the enlightenment of Scripture, man's own consciousness reveals to him an ideal of his position in creation which, in his present state, he does not realize.
