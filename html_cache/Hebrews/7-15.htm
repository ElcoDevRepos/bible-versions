"And what we are speaking of is yet more abundantly evident if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth a different priest, who hath been made (priest) not according to a law of a carnal commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life." Hitherto, in <a href="/context/hebrews/7-12.htm" title="For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.">Hebrews 7:12-14</a>, the thought has rested on what is <span class= "ital">given up,--</span>viz., the priesthood of Aaron, set aside by the words of prophecy (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>); and so far as these three verses are concerned, nothing more might be intended than the transference of the priesthood to <span class= "ital">another line of men.</span> Far more striking will the proof appear, when we look on the other side, and observe what is <span class= "ital">brought in</span>--a priesthood like Melchizedek's, resting not on mere positive enactment, but assumed by inherent power, by right of "life" (<a href="/hebrews/7-8.htm" title="And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives.">Hebrews 7:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it is yet more abundantly evident</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the proposition of ver. 12), <span class="cmt_word">if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another Priest, who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless</span> (indissoluble) <span class="cmt_word">life</span>. For it is testified (of him), Thou art a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. This is a resumption of what has been already seen, put so as to be effective for the present stage of the argument. The old priesthood, and consequently the <span class="accented">Law</span>, is changed and superseded, not only because the Priest of the new order of things is of the tribe of Judah, but still more evidently because his priesthood is witnessed to as being one of a different kind, and of a kind so much higher and diviner. It is evident that the Antitype of Melchizedek, the subject of the hundred and tenth psalm, rather than Melchizedek himself, suggests here the language used.
