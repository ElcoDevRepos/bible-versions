Unlike the repeated sacrifices of the Old Testament, Christ's offering was once for all. The high priests of Israel had to enter the Most Holy Place annually to atone for the sins of the people, highlighting the temporary and incomplete nature of those sacrifices. In contrast, Christ's single entry into heaven signifies the completion and perfection of His redemptive work. This aligns with <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>, which states that Jesus does not need to offer sacrifices daily, as the high priests did.<p><b>as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year</b><br>The high priest's annual entry into the Most Holy Place occurred on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, as described in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. This was the only time the high priest could enter the innermost part of the tabernacle or temple, symbolizing the presence of God. The ritual underscored the separation between God and humanity due to sin, and the need for atonement. The high priest's role was a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate priesthood, as He entered the true heavenly sanctuary once and for all.<p><b>with blood that is not his own</b><br>The high priest carried the blood of bulls and goats, which were insufficient for true atonement, as noted in <a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm">Hebrews 10:4</a>. These sacrifices were symbolic, pointing to the need for a perfect sacrifice. In contrast, Christ offered His own blood, which was perfect and without blemish, fulfilling the requirements for eternal redemption. This act is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant bears the iniquities of many.

The "offering "which is here in thought does not correspond to the actual sacrifice of the sin-offerings on the Day of Atonement, but to the presentation of the blood in the Holiest Place. In this really consisted the presentation of that sacrifice to God. That this is the meaning here is shown by the contrast in the latter part of the verse, where we read of the high priest's entering the Holy Place (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Holy of Holies; see Note on <a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:2</a>) "with blood not his own," and by the argument of <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> blood not his own, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>); <span class="cmt_word">for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now</span> (probably <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, meaning "as it is ") <span class="cmt_word">once at the end of the ages hath he appeared</span> (rather, <span class="accented">been manifested</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span> Here (as above noted) the idea of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> in ver. 12 is taken up. That Christ's offering of himself is once for all, needing no repetition, follows from the view of it already given, viz. that it is a perpetual presentation of himself, after fully availing sacrifice of himself, before the very face of God. That this is of necessity once for all is now further shown by the consideration that repeated offerings of himself would involve the impossible condition of repeated deaths. Observe that "offer himself" in ver. 25 does not refer to the death upon the cross, but to the intercession before the eternal mercy-seat after accomplished atonement, answering to the high priest's entrance, with the blood of previous sacrifice, within the veil. The death itself is denoted in ver. 26 by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> ("suffered"). The argument rests on the principle, already established as being signified by the whole of the ancient ritual, that, for acceptable intercession in behalf of man, previous death or blood-shedding is in every case required. But why add "since the foundation of the world"? We must supply the thought of the retrospective efficacy of Christ's atonement. Ever since sin entered, man needed atonement, signified, but not effected, by the ancient sacrifices. Christ's one offering of himself has supplied this primeval need, availing, not only for the present and future, but also for all past ages. This view was definitely expressed, with reference to "transgressions which were under the first covenant," in ver. 15, and, though not repeated here, is prominent in the writer's mind (cf. <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>, where God's righteousness is said to have been shown in Christ with regard to "the passing over of sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God," as well as to justification of believers now; also <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5</a>, where the effect of Christ's obedience is declared to be coextensive with that of Adam's transgression). This view accounts for "since the foundation of the world," the idea being that, the transgressions requiring atonement having been since then, repeated deaths since then would have been needed had not Christ's one offering of himself availed for all time, just as repeated sacrifices were needed for the high priest's symbolical yearly intercessions. The question is not asked, nor is any reason given, why this one all-sufficient offering was deferred till so long after the need began. It is enough to know that such has been, in fact, the Divine will, viz. that not till the fullness of time was come - not till the end (or consummation) of the long preceding sinful ages - should the Redeemer once for all be manifested for atonement. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, seems certainly to imply the idea, otherwise known to have been prevalent in the apostolic age, of the end of all things being close at hand; and this expectation further accounts for the reference to the past rather than the future in the expression, "since the foundation of the world." For, with regard to the future, the second coming of Christ was the one great idea present to the minds of Christians, the intervening time being regarded by them as but the dawn of coming day (see, on this head, what was said under Hebrews 1:2). The strong expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (for the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. <a href="/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18</a>, where it means "abrogation"), used as it here is with reference to all the transgressions of the ages past, though not to be pressed so as to invalidate what is elsewhere said of the future penal consequences of all willful and unrepented sin, may still be cited among the texts supporting the view of those who "trust the larger hope." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/9-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Nor [did He enter heaven]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(oud&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3761.htm">Strong's 3761: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neither, nor, not even, and not.
