The author of Hebrews often uses Old Testament quotations to establish the authority and divine inspiration of the message. This particular reference is to <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, a messianic psalm that is frequently cited in the New Testament to affirm Jesus' priestly role. The use of "God says" underscores the belief in the divine origin of Scripture, emphasizing that these words are not merely human but are spoken by God Himself.<p><b>&#8220;You are a priest forever</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood. Unlike the Levitical priests, whose service was temporary and limited by their mortality, Jesus' priesthood is everlasting. This eternal aspect is crucial because it assures believers of a perpetual intercessor before God. The concept of a "priest forever" also points to the permanence and sufficiency of Christ's sacrificial work, which does not need to be repeated. This eternal priesthood fulfills the prophecy and promise of a new covenant, superior to the old.<p><b>in the order of Melchizedek.&#8221;</b><br>Melchizedek is a mysterious figure who appears in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a> as the king of Salem and priest of God Most High. His name means "king of righteousness," and he is also associated with peace, being the king of Salem (peace). Unlike the Levitical priesthood, Melchizedek's priesthood is not based on genealogy or the Law but on a divine appointment. This makes him a type of Christ, prefiguring Jesus' unique and superior priesthood. The order of Melchizedek signifies a priesthood that transcends the limitations of the Levitical system, offering a more perfect mediation between God and humanity. This connection is further explored in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, where the author elaborates on the significance of Melchizedek's priesthood in relation to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, recognized as the Son of God and the eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A mysterious figure from the Old Testament, king of Salem and priest of God Most High, who blesses Abraham.
