This highlights the divine authority and sacredness of the Law. The term "binding" indicates that the Law was obligatory and carried the weight of divine command, emphasizing the seriousness with which it was to be regarded. The role of angels in delivering the Law underscores the heavenly origin and the importance of the message, setting a precedent for the authority of divine revelation.<p><b>and every transgression and disobedience received its just punishment</b><br>This phrase underscores the concept of divine justice inherent in the Law. "Transgression" refers to the violation of specific commands, while "disobedience" suggests a broader rejection of God's authority. The Law prescribed specific penalties for various offenses, reflecting the holiness and justice of God. The phrase "just punishment" indicates that the consequences were appropriate and deserved, aligning with the principle of retributive justice found throughout the Old Testament. This serves as a warning of the seriousness of sin and the certainty of divine retribution, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> and <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, which outline blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>In the context of Hebrews, angels are seen as messengers of God who delivered the Law to Moses.

If that was true under Moses, it is even more urgent to heed the greater revelation in Christ, lest neglect bring an even more devastating consequence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The word spoken by angels.</span>--Or rather, <span class= "ital">through angels</span> (comp. <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>): the word was God's, but angels were the medium through which it was given to men. In accordance with the tone of the whole passage (in which the thought is not the reward of obedience, but the peril of neglect of duty), "the word" must denote divine <span class= "ital">commands</span> delivered by angels, and--as the close parallel presented by <a href="/context/hebrews/10-28.htm" title="He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:">Hebrews 10:28-29</a>, seems to prove--especially the commands of the Mosaic law. Hence this verse must be joined to the other passages (<a href="/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>; comp. also <a href="/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:">Acts 7:38</a>) which bring into relief the ministration of angels in the giving of the Law; and the nature of the argument of this Epistle gives special importance to the subject here. The only passage in the Pentateuch which can be quoted in illustration is <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> : "The Lord came from Sinai. . . . He came from amid myriads of holy ones." The Greek version (introducing a double rendering of the Hebrew) adds, "at His right hand were angels with Him;" and two of the Targums likewise speak of the "myriads of holy angels." <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm" title="The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.">Psalm 68:17</a> is difficult and obscure, but very possibly agrees with the passage just quoted in referring to angels as the attendants of Jehovah on the mount. Nowhere in the Old Testament is the thought carried beyond this point; but there are a few passages in Jewish writers which clearly show that such a ministration of angels as is here spoken of was a tenet of Jewish belief in the apostolic age. Philo, after saying that the angels have their name from reporting the commands of the Father to His children, and the wants of the children to the Father, adds: "We are unable to contain His exceeding and unalloyed benefits, if He Himself proffers them to us without employing others as His ministers." Much more important are the words of Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. xv.</span> 5, ? 3), who introduces Herod as reminding the Jews that the noblest of the ordinances and the holiest of the things contained in the laws had been learnt by them from God through angels. Jewish writers quoted by Wetstein speak of the "angels of service" whom Moses had known from the time of the giving of the law; and, moreover, of the angel who, when Moses had through terror forgotten all that he had been taught during the forty days, delivered the law to him again. Such speculations are of interest as showing the place which this tenet held in Jewish doctrine and belief. Here and in <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a> (see Note there) this mediation of angels is adduced as a mark of the inferiority of the law; in <a href="/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>, where no such comparison is made, the contrast implied is between angels and men as givers of a law. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if the word</span> <span class="cmt_word">that was spoken through angels</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Law) <span class="cmt_word">was made</span> (or, <span class="accented">proved</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>steadfast</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> as explained in the next clause, ratified by just visitation of every transgression and disobedience), <span class="cmt_word">how shall we</span> (Christians) <span class="cmt_word">escape, if we neglect so great salvation?</span> The danger of neglect must be in proportion to the dignity of the revelation.

Here the writer ranks himself among those who had not heard Christ himself; his doing which has been considered to afford a presumption against St. Paul having been the writer. For, though not an eyewitness of Christ's ministry, he is in the habit elsewhere of insisting strongly on his having received his "knowledge of the mystery," not from men or through men, but by direct revelation from the ascended Savior (cf. <a href="/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 12</a>). Still, he does not deny elsewhere that for the <span class="accented">facts</span> of Christ's history he was indebted to the testimony of others (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>, etc.).
