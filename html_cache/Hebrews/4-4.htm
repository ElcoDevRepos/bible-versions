The author of Hebrews uses this reference to emphasize the importance of rest, both in the physical sense and as a spiritual metaphor. The "somewhere" indicates the author's assumption that the audience is familiar with the Hebrew Scriptures, which were commonly known among Jewish and early Christian communities. This reflects the oral tradition and memorization of scripture prevalent in the culture at the time.<p><b>&#8220;And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.&#8221;</b><br>This direct quote from <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a> highlights the completion and perfection of God's creation. The concept of rest here is not due to fatigue but signifies the cessation of creative activity, symbolizing satisfaction and fulfillment. In the broader context of Hebrews, this rest is a type of the spiritual rest believers enter through faith in Christ. It also connects to the Sabbath commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to rest on the seventh day, mirroring God's rest. This rest is a foreshadowing of the eternal rest promised to believers, as discussed in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>, and serves as a type of the ultimate rest found in Jesus Christ, who offers rest for the soul (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who rested on the seventh day after completing the work of creation, setting a precedent for the Sabbath rest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event described in Genesis where God created the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seventh_day.htm">The Seventh Day</a></b><br>The day God rested, which is foundational for the concept of the Sabbath in Jewish and Christian traditions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

By quoting &#8220;And on the seventh day God rested from all His works,&#8221; the writer asserts that the promise of entering God&#8217;s rest is as old as creation and still stands. The verse reassures believers that, through faith in Christ, they may share in God&#8217;s own satisfied rest, just as He intended from the very beginning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">For he spake in a certain place.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">For he hath spoken somewhere, </span>another example of indefiniteness of citation.
