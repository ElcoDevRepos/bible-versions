Unlike the Levitical priests, who were appointed based on lineage, Jesus' priesthood was established by a divine oath. This reflects <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where God Himself declares the eternal priesthood of the Messiah. The use of an oath signifies the unchangeable and eternal nature of Jesus' priesthood, contrasting with the temporary and imperfect priesthood of the Old Covenant.<p><b>by the One who said to Him:</b><br>This refers to God the Father, emphasizing the divine authority behind Jesus' priesthood. The Father&#8217;s declaration underscores the legitimacy and supremacy of Jesus' role as High Priest. This divine appointment is rooted in the eternal counsel of God, highlighting the Trinitarian relationship and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>&#8220;The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind:</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the irrevocable nature of God's promise. In biblical context, an oath from God is a solemn and binding declaration. The assurance that God "will not change His mind" reflects His immutability and faithfulness. This is a direct reference to <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, a messianic psalm that prophesies the eternal priesthood of the Messiah, affirming the certainty and permanence of Jesus' priestly role.<p><b>&#8216;You are a priest forever.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase confirms the eternal nature of Jesus' priesthood, distinguishing it from the temporary Levitical priesthood. The term "forever" indicates that Jesus' priestly ministry is unending, aligning with the order of Melchizedek, who is a type of Christ. Melchizedek's priesthood, mentioned in <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a> and expounded in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, serves as a foreshadowing of Christ's eternal and superior priesthood.
