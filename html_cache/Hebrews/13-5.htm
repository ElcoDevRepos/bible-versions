The love of money is often associated with idolatry, as it can become a substitute for reliance on God. In <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, Paul warns that the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, leading some away from the faith. The cultural context of the early church included a society where wealth was often equated with divine favor, yet Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a> that one cannot serve both God and money. This call to avoid the love of money is a reminder to prioritize spiritual wealth over material possessions.<p><b>and be content with what you have</b><br>Contentment is a recurring theme in Scripture, urging believers to find satisfaction in God's provision rather than in worldly abundance. <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a> highlights Paul's own contentment in all circumstances, whether in need or in plenty, through the strength of Christ. The historical context of the early Christians often involved persecution and economic hardship, making the call to contentment particularly poignant. This contentment is rooted in trust in God's sovereignty and goodness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, where the Lord as Shepherd ensures that His people lack nothing.<p><b>for God has said: &#8220;Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you.&#8221;</b><br>This promise of God's presence and faithfulness is a cornerstone of biblical assurance. It echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, where Moses encourages Israel with God's promise as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a> also reiterates this assurance to Joshua as he leads the people. The phrase underscores God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His covenant people. In the New Testament, Jesus reaffirms this promise in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, assuring His disciples of His presence until the end of the age. This assurance provides the foundation for contentment and freedom from the love of money, as believers trust in God's unfailing presence and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.
