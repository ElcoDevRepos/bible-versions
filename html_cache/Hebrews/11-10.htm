Abraham's journey was not just physical but spiritual, as he anticipated God's promises. His faith is a model of trust in God's future fulfillment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, where God calls him to leave his homeland for a promised land. This forward-looking aspect is central to the life of faith, emphasizing hope and trust in God's promises.<p><b>to the city with foundations</b><br>The "city with foundations" contrasts with the temporary, nomadic lifestyle Abraham led. This city represents stability, permanence, and divine establishment, unlike the tents Abraham dwelled in. In biblical terms, foundations signify strength and endurance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, where God lays a tested stone as a foundation. This city is not earthly Jerusalem but a heavenly one, as later described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, symbolizing the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>whose architect and builder is God</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin and construction of the city. Unlike human cities, which are subject to decay and destruction, this city is crafted by God Himself, ensuring its perfection and eternal nature. The imagery of God as an architect and builder is seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>, which emphasizes the futility of human efforts without God's involvement. This city is a type of the New Jerusalem, a place of eternal communion with God, reflecting the ultimate hope for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A patriarch of the faith, Abraham is a central figure in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.

There, the strangers and pilgrims are seeking for a <span class= "ital">country</span> of their own; here, the dweller in tents is waiting for the <span class= "ital">city</span> that hath the foundations. All these verses clearly teach that the promise as apprehended by the patriarchs was not bounded by the gift of Canaan. Of what nature their expectations of the future life may have been we cannot tell; but this they knew, that their fellowship with God and their interest in His promises would not cease with this transient life. What they saw of earthly blessing was but the earnest of some greater gift still future, and yet present through the power of their faith. The shifting tent might be Abraham's home now, but he waited for that city which should never know change--of which alone it could be said that it hath "the foundations," and whose Architect and Maker is God.
