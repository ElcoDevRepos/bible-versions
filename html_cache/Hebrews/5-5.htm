Unlike earthly priests who might seek honor or position, Christ did not assume this role for personal glory. This reflects the biblical principle that true leadership and priesthood are divinely appointed, not self-assumed. In the context of the Old Testament, the high priest was chosen by God, as seen in the selection of Aaron (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). Christ's priesthood is superior and eternal, as He is appointed by God Himself, fulfilling the prophecy of a new priesthood in the order of Melchizedek (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>).<p><b>but He was called by the One who said to Him:</b><br>This indicates the divine calling and authority behind Christ's priesthood. The "One" refers to God the Father, highlighting the Trinitarian relationship and the divine plan of salvation. This calling is not based on human lineage or tradition, as was the case with the Levitical priesthood, but on God's sovereign will. It underscores the unique and eternal nature of Christ's priesthood, which is not subject to human limitations or succession.<p><b>&#8220;You are My Son;</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, a messianic psalm that speaks of the anointed king, the Son of God. It affirms the divine sonship of Christ, a central theme in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels and the writings of Paul. The title "Son" signifies a unique relationship with the Father, indicating both equality with God and submission to His will. This sonship is foundational to understanding Christ's authority and mission.<p><b>today I have become Your Father.&#8221;</b><br>The term "today" signifies a specific point in time, often interpreted as the resurrection or ascension of Christ, where His divine sonship and priesthood are publicly affirmed. This echoes the concept of "begotten" in the sense of being declared or manifested, rather than created. The phrase "I have become Your Father" emphasizes the eternal relationship and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Christ. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant promises and the establishment of a new covenant through Jesus, the ultimate High Priest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christianity, who is recognized as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.

It is important to note that in passages of the Pentateuch where the high priest receives a special designation (usually "the priest" is sufficiently distinctive) his title is almost always "the anointed priest." Hence in the one designation, "the Christ," are united the two testimonies of Scripture which follow. He is the Anointed King (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>), addressed by Jehovah as His Son (see Notes on <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/1-4.htm" title="Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.">Hebrews 1:4-5</a>); by the same Jehovah He is addressed as Priest for ever after the order of one who was both priest and king (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a High Priest</span>. Here begins the proof that Christ fulfils the two requirements, that mentioned second in the previous statement being taken first in the proof - <span class="accented">chiastically</span>, as is usual in this Epistle. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>, may have reference to the glory wherewith Christ is crowned in his exalted position as Priest-King (cf. <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek</span>. These two texts (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>) must be taken together for the proof required. The first (commented on under Hebrews 1:5) shows the Lord's appointment of Christ to his kingly office as Son; the second shows that this kingly office carries with it, also by Divine appointment, an eternal priesthood. Christ's entry into this kingly priesthood is best conceived as inaugurated by his resurrection, after accomplishment of human obedience, whereby he fitted himself for priesthood. Before this he was the destined High Priest, but not the "perfected" High Priest, "ever living to make intercession for <span class="accented">us</span>." It is not during his life on earth, but after his exaltation, that he is spoken of as the High Priest of mankind. In his sufferings and death he was consecrated to his eternal office. This appears from vers. 9, 10, and also from <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, quoted in this verse, where the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek and the exaltation to the right hand of God are regarded together. See also what was said under Hebrews 1:5, of the application to Christ of the other text quoted, "This day have I begotten thee." The Messianic reference and general drift of <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. has been considered under Hebrews 1:13. It was there seen to be more than a <span class="accented">typical</span> prophecy, David having in it a distinct view of One far greater than himself - of the Son to come, whom he calls his LORD. But even had it, like other Messianic psalms, a primary reference to some theocratic king, the remarkable import of ver. 4 would in itself point beyond one. For, though David organized and controlled the priesthood and the services of the sanctuary, though both he and Solomon took a prominent part in solemn acts of worship, yet neither they nor any other king assumed the priestly office, which, in its essential functions, was scrupulously confined to the sons of Aaron. The judgment on Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-22</a>) is a notable evidence of the importance attached to this principle. Yet the verse before us assigns a true priesthood to the future King. For Melchizedek, as he appears in Genesis, is evidently a true priest, though prior to the Aaronic priesthood, uniting in himself, according to the system of the patriarchal age, the royalty and the priesthood of his race: as a true priest, he blessed Abraham, and received tithes from him. But of him, historically and symbolically regarded, the consideration must be reserved for <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, where the subject is taken up. Enough here to observe that in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. a true and everlasting priesthood is assigned to the SON in union with his exalted royalty at the LORD'S right hand, and this by Divine appointment, by the "<span class="accented">voice"</span> or "<span class="accented">oracle"</span> of the Load (ver. 1), confirmed by the LORD'S oath (ver. 4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/5-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hout&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3779.htm">Strong's 3779: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thus, so, in this manner.
