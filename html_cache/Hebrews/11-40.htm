The "something better" refers to the new covenant established through Jesus Christ, which surpasses the old covenant given to the Israelites. This is a recurring theme in Hebrews, emphasizing the superiority of Christ's sacrifice and priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>). The "us" includes both the original audience of the letter and all believers, indicating the inclusivity of God's plan. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which foretold a new covenant.<p><b>so that together with us</b><br>This phrase underscores the unity between the Old Testament saints and New Testament believers. The "together" signifies that the faithful from both covenants are part of a single, continuous plan of salvation. This unity is further illustrated in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, where Paul speaks of Christ breaking down the dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles, creating one new humanity. The concept of being "together" also points to the communal aspect of faith, as seen in the early church's practices (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>).<p><b>they would be made perfect</b><br>The term "made perfect" refers to the completion or fulfillment of God's redemptive work. In the context of Hebrews, perfection is not about moral flawlessness but about reaching the intended goal or purpose. The Old Testament saints, though faithful, did not receive the promise in their lifetime (<a href="/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>). Their perfection is achieved through Christ's atoning work, which is the culmination of God's salvation history. This is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>, where it states that by one sacrifice, Christ has made perfect forever those who are being sanctified. The idea of perfection also ties into the eschatological hope of believers, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, where Paul expresses confidence that God will complete the good work He began in them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign planner and orchestrator of salvation history, who has a divine plan for humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ancients/faithful_of_the_old_testament.htm">The Ancients/Faithful of the Old Testament</a></b><br>The individuals mentioned in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, often referred to as the "Hall of Faith," who lived by faith before the coming of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_testament_believers.htm">The New Testament Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter to the Hebrews, representing all believers who have come to faith in Christ after His resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plan_of_salvation.htm">The Plan of Salvation</a></b><br>God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ, which encompasses both Old and New Testament believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/perfection.htm">Perfection</a></b><br>The completion or fulfillment of God's plan, which involves the unification of all believers in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_plan.htm">God's Sovereign Plan</a></b><br>Recognize that God has a comprehensive plan that spans all of history, and it is centered on Christ.
