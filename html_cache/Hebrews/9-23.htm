In the Old Testament, the tabernacle and later the temple were central to Israelite worship, serving as the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The purification of these earthly copies with animal sacrifices was a requirement under the Mosaic Law, as seen in <a href="/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36-37</a> and <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. These sacrifices were part of the ceremonial law, which pointed forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. The necessity of purification underscores the holiness of God and the need for atonement to approach Him.<p><b>but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these</b><br>The "heavenly things" refer to the true spiritual realities in heaven, of which the earthly tabernacle was a mere shadow. The "better sacrifices" point to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which is superior to the animal sacrifices of the Old Covenant. Christ's sacrifice is once for all, perfect and complete, as emphasized in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>. This sacrifice cleanses not only the earthly copies but also provides access to the heavenly sanctuary, fulfilling the typology of the Old Testament sacrificial system. The superiority of Christ's sacrifice is a central theme in Hebrews, highlighting His role as the ultimate High Priest and the mediator of a new and better covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

They mirrored the true sanctuary in heaven, giving Israel a tangible picture of unseen realities. <a href="/colossians/2-17.htm">Colossians 2:17</a> speaks of such symbols as &#8220;a shadow of the things to come.&#8221; These copies were temporary teaching tools pointing forward to the genuine, eternal realm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be purified with these sacrifices</b><p><a href="/bsb/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> describes how animal blood was sprinkled on the altar, the veil, and the mercy seat on the Day of Atonement. <a href="/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19-21</a> reminds us Moses &#8220;sprinkled the scroll and all the people&#8221; with blood.<p>&#8226; Animal sacrifices dealt ceremonially with Israel&#8217;s sin.<p>&#8226; They cleansed physical space defiled by human transgression.<p>&#8226; Yet <a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm">Hebrews 10:4</a> is clear: &#8220;it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.&#8221; The ritual was effective only insofar as it pointed ahead to something greater.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the heavenly things themselves</b><p>Heaven itself is perfectly pure (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>), yet <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a> says Christ &#8220;entered heaven itself, now to appear in God&#8217;s presence on our behalf.&#8221; The &#8220;cleansing&#8221; of heaven is about securing our access to God&#8217;s throne. Our sin would bar us; therefore, Christ&#8217;s work applies to the heavenly realm so redeemed people can enter boldly (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).

No repetition is needed (<a href="/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/9-23.htm">Hebrews 9:23</a> teaches that God required blood to cleanse the earthly sanctuary because it was only a copy. Those limited sacrifices pointed to the superior, once-for-all sacrifice of Jesus, whose blood opened heaven for forgiven sinners. The verse highlights both the seriousness of sin and the sufficiency of Christ, assuring believers that our access to God rests on a perfect, completed work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">The patterns of things in the heavens.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the tokens</span> (<a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>) <span class= "ital">of the things in the heavens.</span> In the first part of the verse a conclusion is drawn from the sacred history, which related the accomplishment of the divine will, and showed therefore what was "necessary." But the real stress lies on the second part. The whole may be paraphrased thus: "Whilst then it is necessary that what are but tokens of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these things, it is necessary that the heavenly things themselves should be cleansed with better sacrifices than these." The meaning of "these things" might perhaps be found in <a href="/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a> (the various instruments of purification), or in <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a> (the two sin offerings there spoken of); but, from the prominence given to <span class= "ital">repetition</span> in the following verses, the plural seems rather to mean with these sacrifices repeated from time to time. The common thought in the two parts of the verse appears to be (as in <a href="/hebrews/9-21.htm" title="Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.">Hebrews 9:21</a>) that everything relating to the covenant of God with sinful man must be brought under the symbol of expiation, without which he can have no part in that covenant. The "heavenly things" are not defiled by sin; but the true heavenly sanctuary cannot be entered by man, the new fellowship between God and man "in heavenly places" cannot be inaugurated, till the heavenly things themselves have been brought into association with the One atoning sacrifice for man.<p><span class= "bld">Better sacrifices.</span>--Here again the use of the plural is remarkable. It seems to arise from the studious generality in the terms of this verse. To "these things" the natural antithesis is "better sacrifices." That in the ministry of the true High Priest there was a presentation of but <span class= "ital">one</span> sacrifice is not assumed here, because it is to be strongly brought out below (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25-26</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was therefore necessary</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in accordance with the principle above expressed) <span class="cmt_word">that the patterns</span> (rather, <span class="accented">copies</span>, see <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>, <span class="accented">supra</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span> According to the view taken under Hebrews 8:2 and Hebrews 9:11, "the heavenly things" here must be taken to denote the corresponding realities in the heavenly sphere of things to which Christ has gone. But how can they themselves be said to require purification or cleansing? The mundane tabernacle did, being itself conceived as polluted by human sin; but how so of the unpolluted heavenly tabernacle? The answer may be that the expressions, chosen to suit the case of the earthly type, need not be pressed in all their details as applying to the heavenly sanctuary. With regard to the latter, they may he meant only to express that, though it be itself pure, yet <span class="accented">man</span> requires purification for access to it, and that for this purpose "better sacrifices" are required. "In hac apodosi verbum <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">mundari</span>, subauditum, facit hypallagem: nam <span class="accented">exleslia</span> per se sunt pura, sed nos purificandi fuimus, ut ilia possemus capessere" (Bengel). The general meaning is obvious enough. Commentators sometimes raise needless difficulties, and may sometimes even miss the essential purport of a passage by the too constant application of the critical microscope. If, however, it be thought necessary to find a sense in which the heavenly sanctuary may be said to need purification, the idea may be the appeasing of Divine wrath which bars the entrance of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/9-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
