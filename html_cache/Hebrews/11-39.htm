Each of these individuals demonstrated faith in God despite not seeing the fulfillment of His promises during their lifetimes. Their commendation is rooted in their trust and obedience to God, which is a central theme throughout the Bible. This echoes the idea found in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, where Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness. The commendation of faith is a consistent biblical principle, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a> and <a href="/james/2.htm">James 2</a>, which emphasize faith as the basis for righteousness.<p><b>yet they did not receive what was promised</b><br>This phrase highlights the tension between faith and fulfillment. The promises referred to are the messianic and eschatological promises of God, including the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God's kingdom. While these Old Testament saints received partial fulfillments, such as the birth of Isaac to Abraham and Sarah, the ultimate promise of salvation through Jesus Christ was not realized in their lifetimes. This reflects the already-but-not-yet aspect of God's kingdom, where believers live in the tension of promises fulfilled in Christ but not yet fully realized. This concept is further explored in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>, which speaks of prophets who searched intently and with the greatest care to understand the salvation that was to come. The fulfillment of these promises is ultimately found in Jesus Christ, who is the "yes" and "amen" to all of God's promises (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful_of_the_old_testament.htm">The Faithful of the Old Testament</a></b><br>This verse refers to the individuals mentioned throughout <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, often called the "Hall of Faith."

There are three passages of the Epistle which must be kept together--<a href="/hebrews/6-15.htm" title="And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.">Hebrews 6:15</a>, "And so, having patiently waited, he (Abraham) obtained the promise;" <a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm" title="For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.">Hebrews 10:36</a>, "Ye have need of endurance, that having done the will of God ye may receive the promise;" and the present versa. To the saints of the Old Testament the promised blessing was future; they obtained it, but not within the limits of this present life. To us the promised blessing is present, revealed to us in its true nature, obtained for us once for all; for we know that eternal redemption has been won through Christ's entering for us once for all into the heavenly sanctuary (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>), and to us the "perfection" has come, in that through Him we "draw near to God" (<a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a>). That (1) the full personal appropriation of the gift is for every one of us still future, and (2) the full revelation belongs to another state of being, is true, but not inconsistent with what has been said. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers, 39, 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these all, having obtained a good report</span> (literally, <span class="accented">having been witnessed of</span>, as in ver. 2) <span class="cmt_word">through faith, received not the promise: God having provided</span> (or, <span class="accented">foreseen</span>) <span class="cmt_word">some better thing for</span> (literally, <span class="accented">concerning</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</span> There is no contradiction between the assertion here made, that none of the saints of old "received the promise (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) "and its being said of Abraham (<a href="/hebrews/6-15.htm">Hebrews 6:15</a>) that he did "obtain the promise (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)." For though in both passages "the promise," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the great Messianic promise (not "premises," as in ver. 33, <span class="accented">supra</span>), is spoken of - or at any rate, in the case of Abraham, ultimately referred to - yet the verbs used are different and have different meanings, He "obtained" or attained to it, in the sense of having it confirmed and assured to him and his seed (see note on Hebrews 6:15); but he did not actually get it so as to reduce it to possession and enter into the enjoyment of it. The realization of all that is meant by the word here used is, indeed, even to Christian believers, still future (for cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). Nay, it is future also in its fullness, even to the saints at rest; for in the passage just quoted it is plainly intimated that the entire fulfillment will not be till "he that shall come" comes; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till the second advent. The redeemed whose probation on earth is over are indeed, in one sense, said to be already "perfected" (cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-23.htm">Hebrews 12:23</a>); but still the "perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul" is nowhere in the New Testament contemplated till "the end." In the mean time, even the saints under the heavenly altar still cry, "Lord, how long?" and the Spirit and the bride say, "Come, Lord Jesus." The full idea, then, of ver. 40 may be that, according to the eternal Divine purpose, the promise of redemption should not be fully realized till the number of the elect shall be accomplished, and all the redeemed of all ages since the world began shall be gathered together through Christ in one, and God shall be all in all. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(houtoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">{were} all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
