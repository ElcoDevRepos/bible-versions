The concept of "escape" implies a coming judgment or consequence, which is a recurring theme in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/romans/2-3.htm">Romans 2:3</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). The "great salvation" refers to the comprehensive deliverance from sin and its consequences, a central theme in Christian doctrine. The warning against neglect echoes the Old Testament, where neglecting God's commands led to dire consequences (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>). This phrase underscores the urgency and importance of responding to the gospel message.<p><b>This salvation was first announced by the Lord,</b><br>The reference to "the Lord" points to Jesus Christ, who proclaimed the message of salvation during His earthly ministry. This aligns with the Gospels, where Jesus consistently preached about the Kingdom of God and the need for repentance (e.g., <a href="/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14-15</a>). The announcement by Jesus fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>). It also establishes the authority of the message, as it originates from the Son of God Himself.<p><b>was confirmed to us by those who heard Him,</b><br>This phrase highlights the role of the apostles and early disciples as eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, teachings, and resurrection. Their testimony provides a reliable foundation for the Christian faith, as seen in passages like <a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32 and 1</a> <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>. The use of "confirmed" suggests a process of validation and authentication, emphasizing the trustworthiness of the gospel message. This also reflects the early church's reliance on apostolic witness to preserve and spread the teachings of Jesus, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>The passage refers to Jesus as the one who first announced the great salvation.
