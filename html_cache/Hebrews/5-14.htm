In the context of Hebrews, the author is addressing believers who should have progressed in their faith but are still in need of basic teachings. Solid food represents deeper, more complex teachings of the faith, akin to the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9:1-6</a>, where wisdom is depicted as a feast. The mature are those who have moved beyond elementary teachings (<a href="/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6:1</a>) and are able to understand and apply more profound spiritual truths. This maturity is a call to grow in understanding and discernment, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>, where Paul speaks of imparting wisdom to the mature.<p><b>who by constant use</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of regular practice and application of spiritual truths. The Greek word for "use" implies a habitual practice, suggesting that maturity comes through consistent engagement with God's Word and its application in daily life. This is similar to the discipline described in <a href="/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7-8</a>, where believers are encouraged to train themselves for godliness. The idea is that spiritual growth requires ongoing effort and dedication, much like physical training.<p><b>have trained their senses</b><br>The concept of training the senses indicates a process of developing discernment and spiritual insight. This training involves both the mind and the heart, aligning with <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which speaks of the renewal of the mind to discern God's will. The senses here can be understood as spiritual faculties that need to be exercised and honed through experience and practice, much like the training of the body in athletic endeavors (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>).<p><b>to distinguish good from evil</b><br>This final phrase highlights the goal of spiritual maturity: the ability to discern moral and spiritual truths. This discernment is crucial for living a life that pleases God, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9-10</a>, where Paul prays for believers to have love that abounds in knowledge and depth of insight. The ability to distinguish good from evil is rooted in a deep understanding of God's Word, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's Word is described as a lamp to the feet and a light to the path. This discernment is also a mark of wisdom, as described in <a href="/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13-18</a>, where true wisdom is characterized by purity, peace-loving, and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

So, in the spiritual sphere, the mental faculties, exercised at first on simple truths, should acquire by practice the power of apprehending and distinguishing' between higher and more recondite ones. It was because the Hebrew Christians had failed thus to bring out their faculties that they were open to the charge of being still in a state of infancy. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/5-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">solid</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(sterea)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4731.htm">Strong's 4731: </a> </span><span class="str2">Solid, firm, steadfast.
