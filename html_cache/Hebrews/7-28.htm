These priests were inherently flawed and subject to human weaknesses, including sin and mortality. The high priest had to offer sacrifices for his own sins before he could intercede for the people (<a href="/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a>). This highlights the imperfection and temporary nature of the Levitical priesthood, which was a shadow of the greater priesthood to come. The weakness of these priests underscores the need for a perfect and eternal high priest.<p><b>but the oath, which came after the law,</b><br>The "oath" refers to God's promise, as mentioned in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where God swears an unchangeable oath that the Messiah would be a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. This oath came after the establishment of the Mosaic Law and signifies a new and superior covenant. The use of an oath emphasizes the certainty and permanence of God's promise, contrasting with the temporary and changeable nature of the Levitical priesthood.<p><b>appointed the Son,</b><br>The "Son" refers to Jesus Christ, who is appointed by God as the eternal high priest. Unlike the Levitical priests, Jesus is not appointed based on lineage or human law but by divine decree. This appointment signifies His unique role as both the Son of God and the perfect mediator between God and humanity. The appointment of Jesus fulfills the prophecy and typology of Melchizedek, who was both a king and a priest, pointing to Christ's dual role.<p><b>who has been made perfect forever.</b><br>Jesus' perfection is not about moral improvement but about His complete and eternal qualification to serve as high priest. His perfection is demonstrated through His sinless life, sacrificial death, and victorious resurrection. Unlike the Levitical priests, who had to repeatedly offer sacrifices, Jesus' one-time sacrifice was sufficient for all time (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12-14</a>). His eternal perfection ensures that He is always able to intercede for those who come to God through Him, providing a permanent solution to the problem of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priests.htm">High Priests</a></b><br>In the Old Testament, high priests were appointed to mediate between God and the people, offering sacrifices for sins.

Through suffering, death, and resurrection, Jesus fully qualified to mediate between God and humanity.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Forever&#8221; emphasizes His eternal, unchanging ministry: &#8220;Because Jesus lives forever, He has a permanent priesthood. Therefore He is able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; His perfection guarantees:<p>&#8211; No further sacrifices are needed (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12-14</a>).<p>&#8211; Continuous intercession in heaven (<a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>).<p>&#8211; Absolute security for believers (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/7-28.htm">Hebrews 7:28</a> contrasts two priesthoods: the Law&#8217;s succession of weak, mortal men and God&#8217;s sworn appointment of His perfect, eternal Son. The Levitical priests reveal humanity&#8217;s frailty and the temporary nature of their ministry, while the oath in <a href="/bsb/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a> installs Jesus as the flawless, everlasting High Priest. Because Christ is perfect forever, His one-time sacrifice fully atones for sin, His intercession never ceases, and our salvation rests on an unshakable foundation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">For the Law appointeth men high priests, </span>(<span class= "ital">men</span>)<span class= "ital"> having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the Law, appointeth a Son, who hath been perfected for ever.</span> On "the word of the oath" see <a href="/context/hebrews/7-20.htm" title="And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:">Hebrews 7:20-21</a>.
