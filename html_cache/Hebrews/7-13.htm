The "things" mentioned pertain to His priesthood, which is likened to that of Melchizedek, a king-priest figure from <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>. The author of Hebrews emphasizes that Jesus' priesthood is superior to the Levitical priesthood, which is a key theme throughout the book. This connection to Melchizedek highlights Jesus' eternal and unchangeable priesthood, as Melchizedek is presented without genealogy or recorded death, symbolizing an eternal priesthood.<p><b>belonged to a different tribe</b><br>Jesus is from the tribe of Judah, as outlined in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a> and <a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23-38</a>, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah coming from the line of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The tribe of Judah is traditionally associated with kingship, not priesthood, which was the domain of the tribe of Levi. This distinction underscores the uniqueness of Jesus' priesthood, as He does not fit the traditional Levitical mold, yet He fulfills the role of both King and Priest.<p><b>from which no one has ever served at the altar</b><br>The altar service was exclusively the responsibility of the Levites, specifically the descendants of Aaron, as detailed in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a> and <a href="/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18:1-7</a>. This historical and cultural context highlights the radical nature of Jesus' priesthood. By serving as a priest from the tribe of Judah, Jesus establishes a new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which transcends the old Levitical system. This new order is based on the power of an indestructible life, as stated in <a href="/hebrews/7-16.htm">Hebrews 7:16</a>, and signifies a shift from the law to grace, fulfilling the law's ultimate purpose through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A mysterious figure in the Bible, Melchizedek is both a king and a priest.

For it is to Christian believers, with whatever Jewish prejudices, not to unbelieving Jews, that the Epistle is addressed. It is important to observe that the Davidic descent of our Lord is spoken of as an acknowledged fact, not merely as an inference from prophecy. "We have here a most significant proof that the descent of Jesus from the tribe of Judah was a well and universally known fact before the destruction of Jerusalem" (Ebrard). "Illo igitur tempore nulla difficultate laborabat genealogia Jesu Christi: et hoc ipsum difficultatibus postea exortis abunde medetur" (Bengel).
