It highlights Jesus' composure and authority even in the face of unjust trial. Jesus often used questions and answers to reveal deeper truths, as seen throughout the Gospels.<p><b>You would have no authority over Me</b><br>Here, Jesus acknowledges Pilate's earthly authority but implies its limitations. This reflects the biblical theme that all earthly power is subordinate to divine sovereignty, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, which states that all authority is established by God.<p><b>if it were not given to you from above</b><br>This phrase underscores the belief in God's ultimate control over human affairs.

It highlights the culpability of those who knowingly acted against Jesus, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend.<p><b>is guilty of greater sin</b><br>Jesus distinguishes between levels of sin, suggesting that those with greater knowledge and intent bear more responsibility. This aligns with <a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47-48</a>, where Jesus teaches that those who know their master's will and do not do it will receive a harsher punishment.

Jesus is not resisting arrest out of weakness but allowing events to unfold by choice (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>, &#8220;No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently teaches that earthly rulers possess authority only insofar as God permits (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, &#8220;For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist are appointed by God,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Pilate therefore stands face-to-face with the very One whose sovereign hand sustains his political office.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;if it were not given to you from above&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jesus roots Pilate&#8217;s authority in God&#8217;s sovereign gift: &#8220;from above&#8221; indicates heaven&#8217;s throne, not human appointment.<p>&#8226; Though Rome thinks it controls the situation, God is orchestrating redemption (<a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Even pagan kings such as Cyrus received power &#8220;from above&#8221; to serve divine purposes (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-7</a>).

Yet every participant will answer for personal choices, and those who sinned against greater light incur greater guilt. The verse therefore comforts believers with God&#8217;s control while warning all people to steward the revelation they possess.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.</span>--Pilate had twice said, with something of the pride of his position, "I have power." Jesus says that he had of himself neither power of life nor power of death, that he had no power against Him but that which was given to him from above. By this is meant, of course, the power which was given to him by God, and the form in which it is expressed ("from above") has a special force in connection with the question of <a href="/john/19-8.htm" title="When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;">John 19:8</a>, "Whence comest Thou?" That power of which he boasted existed only because He against whom he boasts submitted to it of His own will. "He that cometh from above is above all" (<a href="/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>). But that power was given to him of God for the carrying out of the Messianic purposes which rendered the death of Jesus necessary. The position of Pilate was that of a half-conscious agent wielding this power. He indeed had sin, for he acted against his own better nature; but not the greater sin, for he did not act against the full light of truth.<p><span class= "bld">He that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</span>--This cannot mean Judas, who is nowhere mentioned in this connection, and is excluded by the words "unto thee." Judas delivered our Lord to the Jews. It was the Sanhedrin, and especially Caiaphas, the high priest, who, professing to represent God on earth, had delivered up the Son of God, and had declared that by the law He ought to die. (Comp. <a href="/john/11-49.htm" title="And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, You know nothing at all,">John 11:49</a>; <a href="/context/john/18-14.htm" title="Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.">John 18:14-28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wouldst not have</span> <span class="cmt_word">authority against me of any kind,</span> either judicial or actual, or both combined: thou wouldst hold no judicial position which I or others could recognize, nor wouldst thou have the faintest power to proceed against me unless, etc. Here our Lord points to the great doctrine which Paul afterwards expressed (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>) about the powers that be, and hints that every circumstance and event which led to Pilate's occupancy of that judgment-seat, or which in recent times had delivered up the people of the Lord to the authority of Rome, and prepared for the occupancy of the Praetorium by Pontius Pilate himself, was altogether beyond the range of his judge's spontaneity and competency. <span class="cmt_word">Unless it were given thee from above</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). He does not say, "from my Father," or "from God" - phrases which would have been incomprehensible to a skeptical heathen; but "from above," from that Divine providential source of all power which rules all. The Lord thus implies the Divine legitimation of the judicial rank of Pilate; and the fact that his continuous occupancy of it was a talent revocable in a moment by the hand that gave it, and that all the exercise of his so-called <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> was dependent on his supreme will. <span class="cmt_word">For this cause he that delivered</span> <span class="cmt_word">me up to thee.</span> Though Judas is continually described as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>; <a href="/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>; <a href="/john/11-21.htm">John 11:21</a>; <a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>; <a href="/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64-71</a>), yet we have already seen that the act of Judas had been endorsed by the people, and by the Sanhedrin, who now by their highest official representative had "delivered" him up to Pilate (<a href="/john/18-35.htm">John 18:35</a>, note), betrayed him with murderous intention to the power which could not merely excommunicate, but could kill by judicial process. Our Lord may either refer to Caiaphas (Bengel, Meyer, Luthardt) or to the Sanhedrin and people as a whole (Godet). <span class="cmt_word">Hath greater sin</span>. "Because the initiative has been taken by him, and irrespective of thee; because thy power, such as it is over me, is a Divine arrangement, made irrespective of thy will; and the whole of this proceeding has been forced upon thee against thy better judgment." Nevertheless, he implies that Pilate has sinned: he was exercising his seeming judicial rights irrespective of justice. He had declared Jesus to be free from blame or charge in open court, but he had nevertheless submitted the innocent Sufferer to the utmost wrong; but he that delivered Christ-to Pilate had done so out of willful ignorance, and was sinning against light and knowledge. Caiaphas might have recognized Christ's true Messiahship, and accepted his true claims, and bowed before him as the Sent of God, as the Son of the Blessed; but instead of this he had violated the law, and sacrificed the hope and spiritual independence of his own people, out of deference to the sacrosanct honors of his own order. Pilate's consciousness of independence is rebuked, and his conscience appealed to, and the Lord, in this last word to his judge, claims to be his Suzerain, and awards to him his share of blame. Pilate said to the Jews, "I find no fault in him;" Jesus said to Pilate, "Thou hast committed a great sin, though there is another God-given <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, which is more seriously and culpably trifled with than thine is: he that delivered me to thee hath committed a greater." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;You would have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#967;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eiches)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
