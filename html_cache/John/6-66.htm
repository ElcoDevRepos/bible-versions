The context is the aftermath of Jesus' teaching on being the Bread of Life, which was difficult for many to accept. This teaching followed the miraculous feeding of the 5,000, a sign that pointed to Jesus as the sustainer of life. The phrase suggests a turning point where the crowd's enthusiasm waned due to the challenging nature of His message.<p><b>many of His disciples</b><br>The term "disciples" here refers not only to the Twelve Apostles but to a broader group of followers who had been accompanying Jesus. These individuals were initially attracted by His miracles and teachings. The use of "many" highlights that a significant number of these followers were unable to accept the deeper spiritual truths Jesus was revealing, distinguishing between mere followers and true believers.<p><b>turned back</b><br>This indicates a physical and spiritual departure. The Greek word used here implies a decisive action of leaving or withdrawing. It reflects a rejection of Jesus' teachings and a return to their previous way of life. This turning back is symbolic of a lack of faith and understanding, reminiscent of Israel's frequent turning away from God in the Old Testament.<p><b>and no longer walked with Him</b><br>Walking with Jesus is a metaphor for discipleship and fellowship. To "walk with Him" implies a continuous, committed relationship. The decision to no longer walk with Him signifies a complete severance of that relationship. This phrase underscores the cost of true discipleship, which requires acceptance of Jesus' identity and mission, even when it is difficult to understand or accept. This moment foreshadows the ultimate rejection Jesus would face, culminating in His crucifixion, and serves as a call to evaluate one's own commitment to following Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose teachings and claims about being the "bread of life" led to a division among His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>A broader group of followers beyond the Twelve Apostles, many of whom struggled with Jesus' teachings and chose to leave.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The location where Jesus delivered the discourse on the bread of life, which is the context for this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve_apostles.htm">The Twelve Apostles</a></b><br>The core group of Jesus' followers who remained with Him despite the challenging teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bread_of_life_discourse.htm">The Bread of Life Discourse</a></b><br>The event where Jesus explained that He is the spiritual sustenance necessary for eternal life, leading to the departure of many disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus requires commitment, even when His teachings are difficult to understand or accept.

"From that" probably means on that account, because of the words He had spoken. The actual departure was the result of the teaching, which tested their faith and found it wanting, and was at that time, not gradually from that time onwards. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/19-12.htm" title="And from thereafter Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.">John 19:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Many of his disciples.</span>--Co-extensive with the same term in <a href="/john/6-60.htm" title="Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?">John 6:60</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 66.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon this</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">qua propter</span>). Not "from that time forwards," not a gradual thinning down or departure of some disciples, one today and another tomorrow, but a kind of rush and stampede took place. Those who a few hours before were ready to call him their Messianic King, were entirely disenchanted. The claims of Christ were so profoundly different from what they anticipated that <span class="cmt_word">upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</span> The fascination those felt who had seen some of the excellences of Jesus led them to put themselves at his disposal, to wait upon him, to desert their ordinary occupations. Hence part of the phraseology of redemption was derived from the method of Christ. Men "came" to him; they "followed" him; they "walked" with him; they could "go back," desert, forsake their Lord. These actions of his first disciples have created the vocabulary of the kingdom of God. Christ's teaching tested as well as attracted men. There was a repellent force as well as an infinite fascination. He sifted as well as saved. The very deeds and words that broke some hearts into penitence roused impatient and angry remonstrance in others. There is seen in this Gospel a continual departure and a deepening faith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-66.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">From</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(Ek)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
