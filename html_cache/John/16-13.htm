The coming of the Spirit is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise to His disciples, providing them with guidance and understanding after His departure. This event is historically linked to Pentecost (Acts 2), where the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, empowering them for ministry. The title "Spirit of truth" underscores the Spirit's role in conveying God's truth, contrasting with the deception of the world.<p><b>He will guide you into all truth</b><br>The guidance into "all truth" suggests a comprehensive understanding of God's will and purposes. This guidance is not limited to intellectual knowledge but includes spiritual insight and discernment. The Spirit's role is to illuminate the teachings of Jesus, helping believers to apply them in their lives. This aligns with the promise in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>, where the Spirit is described as a teacher who reminds the disciples of Jesus' words. The phrase also implies a continuous process of learning and growth in the truth.<p><b>For He will not speak on His own</b><br>This indicates the Spirit's submission to the Father and the Son, reflecting the unity and harmony within the Trinity. The Spirit's message is not independent but is in perfect alignment with the will of God. This mirrors Jesus' own ministry, where He repeatedly stated that His teachings were not His own but from the Father (<a href="/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>). The Spirit's role is to faithfully communicate the divine message, ensuring consistency with the teachings of Christ.<p><b>but He will speak what He hears</b><br>The Spirit's communication is based on divine revelation, not human invention. This phrase emphasizes the Spirit's role as a conduit of God's truth, relaying what He "hears" from the Father and the Son. This ensures that the message is authoritative and trustworthy. The Spirit's work is to reveal the mysteries of God, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10-13</a>, where the Spirit searches the deep things of God and makes them known to believers.<p><b>and He will declare to you what is to come</b><br>This aspect of the Spirit's work involves revealing future events and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan. This prophetic element is seen in the Spirit's role in inspiring the New Testament writers, who recorded revelations about the end times and the return of Christ. The Spirit's declaration of "what is to come" provides hope and assurance to believers, reminding them of God's sovereignty and the ultimate fulfillment of His promises. This aligns with the prophetic tradition in Scripture, where God's Spirit reveals future events to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, providing comfort and instruction to His disciples about the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Referred to as the "Spirit of truth," who will guide the disciples into all truth and reveal future events.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, who are being prepared for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus shares His final teachings with His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_future_revelation.htm">The Future Revelation</a></b><br>The events and truths that the Holy Spirit will reveal to the disciples, including the unfolding of God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is our guide into all truth, not just a source of comfort but an active teacher and revealer of God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_divine_guidance.htm">Dependence on Divine Guidance</a></b><br>Believers are called to rely on the Holy Spirit for understanding and discernment, rather than solely on human wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit's_consistency_with_christ.htm">The Spirit's Consistency with Christ</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit speaks what He hears from the Father and the Son, ensuring that His guidance is consistent with the teachings of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/anticipation_of_future_revelation.htm">Anticipation of Future Revelation</a></b><br>The Spirit's role includes revealing what is to come, encouraging believers to live with an eternal perspective and readiness for God's unfolding plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_listening_and_obedience.htm">Active Listening and Obedience</a></b><br>As the Spirit speaks, believers must cultivate a posture of active listening and obedience to His guidance in their daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_16_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 16:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_the_Spirit_guide_us_today.htm">How does the Spirit of truth guide us into all truth today?

And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.">Acts 8:31</a>. A comparison of these passages will show that its meaning is "to point out the way," "to lead one on his way." The fulness of truth is for the disciples an unknown territory. They are spiritually as blind men, feeling after the truth, but not able to see it. The Spirit of Truth will take them by the hand, and, step by step, as they have strength to follow, will guide them into the territory, and unfold to them the treasures it contains. The promise has a special meaning for the disciples to whom it was spoken; but it holds good for every disciple who seeks to know the truth. We may pray,--without doubt that the prayer is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and without doubt that it will be answered-- . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come.</span> This points to the definite promise already made (conditioned by his own departure, and so rendering that departure "expedient") when the Spirit of truth is come, having been sent by me from the Father. <span class="cmt_word">He will be your Guide</span> (so that you will not be mere passive instruments, but living agents. "Things" may be transported, but "persons" only can be "guided." The pillar of fire and cloud led the way, and Israel struck its camp and followed) <span class="cmt_word">into the truth in all its parts</span>. As Godet says, "The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> suits <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> better than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>." A most glorious promise this, for as days of darkness and perplexity draw on, fresh needs will arise. The "many things" which would thus be said must be presumed to have been said on highest authority; and hence the unapproachable dignity of the apostles themselves; hence the secret of all their binding and loosing power; hence the revelations they have been able to supply with reference to Christ and salvation, glory, duty, and eternal life, and all the laws of the kingdom. From this vast promise we see the sufficiency of the apostolic teaching, and by implication the portion of it which is committed to writing. Our Lord had delivered to his disciples "nothing but the truth;" but from the nature of the case they must wait for the truth in its completeness, the whole truth of salvation and deliverance. But our Lord proceeds to show that the infallibility of the Holy Spirit is not that he will be a secondary, or tertiary, or independent Divinity. Like Christ, the Son of God, who was in the bosom of the Father (see <a href="/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17, 18</a>; <a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>), so he who proceedeth from the <span class="cmt_word">Father will not speak from himself</span>, as from any spontaneous, independent source. He is, in his gracious operations, no rival Deity, but the Spirit of the Father and the Son (comp. <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, where the essence of the lie is that the devil speaketh of his own), <span class="cmt_word">and whatsoever things he shall hear</span> (or, <span class="accented">heareth</span>, or, <span class="accented">shall have heard</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that shall he speak</span>. The verb "hear" is used absolutely, and has been variously completed with the words, "of me" or "of the Father," whether verbally supplemented or not. We learn that the Holy Spirit is limited by the revelation already involved in the great fact of the Incarnation. "He will speak" of that which he hears, <span class="cmt_word">and he will declare to you the things that are coming</span>. The revelation will concern Christ and the future. The whole New Testament, so far as it is apostolic, is here declared to be the work inspired by the Spirit's guidance of the apostles' mind into the truth in all its completeness and in all its parts. Some, like Westcott, refer the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> to "the constitution of the Christian Church;" but the most satisfactory view is that the Spirit would himself be the Source of the prophetic hope and wondrous vision of the future which pervades the apostolic writings. Hengstenberg runs here into great detail. His remark is of deep interest - that such a promise should be found in the Fourth Gospel, preluding those sublime premonitions which the beloved disciple, when "in the Spirit," received and recorded concerning the things which are and are to come (<a href="/revelation/1-19.htm">Revelation 1:19</a>). Not only in the writings of John, but of Peter, and in the prophetic spirit given to Paul, we see how the Lord the Spirit fulfilled the promise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">However,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hotan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3752.htm">Strong's 3752: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, whenever.
