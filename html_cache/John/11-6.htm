The mention of Lazarus being sick sets the stage for the miracle of raising him from the dead, which is a pivotal event in the Gospel of John. The sickness of Lazarus is significant as it provides an opportunity for Jesus to demonstrate His power over life and death, affirming His identity as the Son of God. This moment also foreshadows Jesus' own death and resurrection. The relationship between Jesus and Lazarus is important, as it highlights Jesus' humanity and His deep personal connections, which are evident throughout His ministry.<p><b>He stayed where He was for two days</b><br>This phrase is crucial in understanding Jesus' deliberate actions. By choosing to stay for two more days, Jesus ensures that Lazarus will have been dead for four days by the time He arrives, which is significant in Jewish belief. According to Jewish customs, the soul was thought to linger near the body for three days after death, so a four-day period emphasizes the finality of Lazarus's death and the magnitude of the miracle Jesus is about to perform. This delay also serves to strengthen the faith of the disciples and those who witness the miracle, as it underscores that Jesus' timing is perfect and His actions are purposeful. The two-day wait is a demonstration of Jesus' divine authority and His control over the situation, reinforcing the theme that God's ways and timing are beyond human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.

Nothing surprises Him, and nothing forces Him into hurried action (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He stayed where He was</b><p>&#8211; Rather than rushing to Bethany, Jesus remained in Perea, demonstrating deliberate restraint.<p>&#8211; This mirrors other instances where He refused to act on human schedules&#8212;&#8220;My time has not yet come&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>; 7:6).<p>&#8211; By staying put, He teaches that obedience to the Father, not public pressure, guides His steps (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>).<p>&#8211; Bullet points of purpose:<p>&#8226; To reveal a greater glory through resurrection, not mere healing (<a href="/john/11-4.htm">John 11:4, 40</a>).<p>&#8226; To strengthen the disciples&#8217; faith by allowing circumstances to become impossible apart from divine intervention (<a href="/john/11-14.htm">John 11:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; To provide irrefutable evidence of His mastery over death, foreshadowing His own resurrection (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for two days</b><p>&#8211; The short delay ensured Lazarus would be in the tomb four days by Jesus&#8217; arrival (<a href="/john/11-17.htm">John 11:17</a>), removing any doubt about the reality of death and decay (cf.

What feels like divine hesitation is often divine preparation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">When he had heard therefore.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">When He heard therefore</span> . . .<p><span class= "bld">He abode two days still.</span>--It is usual to explain this delay as caused by His wish to test the faith of the sisters, or by the nature of the work which He was then doing, and was unwilling to leave. But the first reason passes over the fact that their faith had been shown in their message to Him; and the second postulates His presence at Bethany as necessary for the restoration of Lazarus. (Comp. <a href="/context/john/4-49.htm" title="The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.">John 4:49-50</a>.) A juster view is that which remembers the principle which He had taught at the first miracle (<a href="/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>), that the hours of His work were marked out by signs that He alone could read, but that every hour had its work, and every work its hour. (Comp. <a href="/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a>; <a href="/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

He did not remain because he loved, but, <span class="accented">though</span> he remained, and <span class="accented">because</span> he loved, he said, "Let us," etc. So that we do not see here any intention on his part, by remaining, to test their love (Olshausen), nor to exaggerate the effect of the miracle by raising a dead man from his grave rather than from his death-bed or his bier. It is not difficult to gather from the sequel that when the message reached Jesus Lazarus was dead and buried. We find that when our Lord returned to Bethany four days had elapsed since the death of Lazarus, and the four days must be calculated thus: First one long day's journey from Peraea to Bethany, a distance of eight or nine leagues. If the messenger of the sisters had taken equal time to reach Jesus in Perked, or even a longer period, as time might easily be consumed in the effort to find our Lord in the mountains of Moab; then the two days of his waiting after receiving the message would, with those occupied by the double journey, make up the four that had passed when Jesus reached the grave. Lucke, Neander, Godet, and Westcott think that our Lord remained in Peraea because there was work in which he was engaged and could not relinquish. Meyer, Moulton, and Weiss, that he waited for some especial communication from his Father, for some revelation of moral necessity and heavenly inspiration, like those which dictated all his other movements. B. Weiss: "It was a sacrifice to his calling, of his heart's most ardent desires, that he remained quietly two days in the same place." "We see," says Edersheim, "Christ once more asleep while the disciples are despairing, swamped in the storm! Christ never in haste, because always sure." The silences of Scripture and the waitings of God are often without explanation. The event proves that deep purpose presided over them. The "let us go," etc., implies a lofty courage, a sense of coming crisis. Love conquers fear and peril for himself and his followers. "Judaea" is mentioned rather than Bethany for the same reason. The "again" points forcibly back to the last visit, when he told both friends and foes that the good Shepherd would snatch his sheep from the jaws of death, even though he lay down his own life in the doing of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
