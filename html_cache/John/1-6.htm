His arrival marks the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning a forerunner to the Messiah. The phrase emphasizes the divine timing and purpose of John's appearance, aligning with God's redemptive plan. John&#8217;s coming is significant as it bridges the Old and New Testaments, heralding the arrival of Jesus Christ.<p><b>who was sent from God.</b><br>John's mission is divinely ordained, underscoring his role as a prophet. This phrase highlights the authority and legitimacy of his ministry. In the cultural context of the time, prophets were recognized as messengers of God, and John's unique calling is affirmed by his miraculous birth to elderly parents, as recorded in <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a>. His mission was to prepare the way for the Lord, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>.<p><b>His name was John.</b><br>The name "John" means "Yahweh is gracious," reflecting the grace of God in sending a forerunner to announce the coming of the Messiah. The angel Gabriel instructed Zechariah, John's father, to name him John, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>, signifying the importance of his role. John's identity and mission were established by God, and his life was dedicated to pointing others to Jesus, the Lamb of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A pivotal figure in the New Testament, John the Baptist was a prophet sent by God to prepare the way for Jesus Christ.

Unlike the eternal Word introduced in verses 1&#8211;5, John is a man, born in time and space (<a href="/luke/1-57.htm">Luke 1:57&#8211;60</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture never treats him as myth or symbol. His historical arrival is as certain as the birth of Jesus foretold in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>.<p>&#8226; This man&#8217;s appearance fulfills long&#8211;standing prophecy: &#8220;Behold, I will send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before Me&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>). <a href="/matthew/11-11.htm">Matthew 11:11</a> records Jesus calling John &#8220;among those born of women&#8221; the greatest, confirming both his humanity and his significance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was sent from God</b><p>&#8226; John did not volunteer for a self-appointed mission; heaven itself commissioned him. <a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15-17</a> shows the angel Gabriel announcing his birth and purpose: &#8220;to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;sent&#8221; places John firmly under divine authority. When questioned later, he says, &#8220;He who sent me to baptize with water told me, &#8216;The One on whom you see the Spirit descend&#8230;&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>).<p>&#8226; This sending aligns with <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;A voice of one calling in the wilderness, &#8216;Prepare the way for the LORD.&#8217; &#8221; John functions as God&#8217;s herald, paving the road for Christ just as royal envoys cleared paths for ancient kings.<p>&#8226; The phrase also affirms God&#8217;s active hand in redemptive history, moving from promises to fulfillment (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His name was John</b><p>&#8226; Names in Scripture carry purpose.

"The Word was God:" the man was "sent from God."<p>On the mission of John, see Notes on Matthew 3. The name was not uncommon, but it is striking that it is given here without the usual distinctive "Baptist." The writer stood to him in the relation of disciple to teacher. To him he was <span class= "ital">the</span> John. A greater teacher had not then appeared, but when He did appear, former teacher and disciple alike bear witness to Him.

At this point the evangelist touches on the temporal mission and effulgence of the true Light in the Incarnation; yet this paragraph deals with far more general characteristics and wider ranges of thought than the earthly ministry of Christ on which he is about to enlarge. First of all, he deals with the testimony of John in its widest sense; afterwards he enlarges upon it in its striking detail. Consequently, we think that "the man," "John," is, when first introduced, referred to in his representative character rather than his historical position. The teaching of the prophets and synoptists shows that "John" was rather the exponent of the old covenant than the harbinger of the new. He was the embodiment of the idea of prophet, priest, and ascetic of the patriarchal, Mosaic, and latest Hebraic revelation. He was "more than a prophet." No one greater than he had ever been born of woman, and his functions in these several particulars are strongly impressed upon that disciple who here loses his own individuality in the strength of his Master's teaching. Through this very "man sent from God" the apostle had been prepared to see and personally receive the Logos incarnate. His personality gathered up for our author all that there was in the past of definite revelation, while Jesus filled up all the present and the future. First of all, he treats the mission of the Baptist as representative of all that wonderful past. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">There came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(Egeneto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(anthr&#333;pos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_444.htm">Strong's 444: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man, one of the human race.
