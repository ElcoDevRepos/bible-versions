A hired hand, however, lacks the personal investment and commitment of a true shepherd. This distinction highlights the difference between genuine spiritual leaders and those who serve only for personal gain. The hired hand represents leaders who do not have a true calling or love for the people they serve, contrasting with Jesus, the Good Shepherd, who lays down His life for His sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>and the sheep are not his own</b><br>Ownership implies responsibility and care. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, shepherds often owned their sheep, creating a deep bond and sense of duty. The hired hand, lacking this ownership, does not have the same level of concern or dedication. This phrase underscores the intimate relationship between Jesus and His followers, as He knows them by name and they recognize His voice (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3-4</a>).<p><b>When he sees the wolf coming</b><br>Wolves were natural predators of sheep in the ancient Near East, symbolizing danger and threat. In a spiritual sense, wolves can represent false teachers or external threats to the church. The hired hand's reaction to the wolf reveals his lack of commitment and courage. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures warning against false prophets who come in sheep's clothing but are inwardly ravenous wolves (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>).<p><b>he abandons the sheep and runs away</b><br>The hired hand's flight in the face of danger illustrates his self-preservation over the welfare of the sheep. This behavior contrasts sharply with the sacrificial nature of Jesus, who does not flee from danger but willingly faces it for the sake of His flock. This abandonment can also be seen as a warning against leaders who fail to protect their congregations from spiritual harm.<p><b>Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock</b><br>The scattering of the flock signifies the chaos and vulnerability that ensue when leadership fails. In the absence of a protective shepherd, the sheep are left defenseless against predators. This scattering can be seen as a metaphor for the dispersion of believers when they lack strong, faithful leadership. It also reflects the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, where the striking of the shepherd leads to the scattering of the sheep, a prophecy Jesus applies to Himself in <a href="/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hired_hand.htm">The Hired Hand</a></b><br>Represents those who are not genuinely committed to the well-being of the flock.

It implies a lower position than the household servant, and is more nearly what we should call the tramp-labourer. The thought follows from that of the good shepherd who in the time of danger will give his own life for the sheep. The hireling has no interest in the sheep, and cares for them only as far as to secure his own hire. This want of interest is strongly expressed in the double statement, "not the shepherd," "whose own the sheep are not." In the interpretation we are not to think of the hierarchy, who have been already, in <a href="/john/10-8.htm" title="All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.">John 10:8</a>, designated as "thieves and robbers," breaking into the fold, but of all persons who from any other motive than love for humanity, and by any other way than the door which is Christ, or by any other call than that of the Holy Spirit, take upon themselves the office of shepherds of the flock. The hour of danger will distinguish between the shepherd and the hireling. The one, loving the sheep, will give even his life for them. The other, caring only for the hire, in whatever form it comes, will flee and leave the sheep as a prey to the wolf.<p><span class= "bld">And the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</span>--The words "the sheep" are not found in the majority of the better MSS., and their insertion makes the sentence awkward, because the pronoun "them" has been immediately before used for the same sheep. Adopting the better reading (see Note on next verse), we have, <span class= "ital">and the wolf catcheth them, and maketh havoc</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> seizeth individual sheep, and maketh havoc in the flock. Under the general image we are to understand all the spiritual foes which destroy individual souls and rend the Church of Christ. The wolf is the natural enemy of the sheep, and the fit emblem of all evil persons, who are the natural enemies of the sheep of Christ's fold. He spake of "false prophets" as "ravening wolves" (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm" title="Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.">Matthew 7:15</a>). He sent forth the Twelve "as sheep in the midst of wolves" (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>), and the Seventy, whose mission, we shall see (comp. Note on <a href="/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.">John 10:22</a>), was connected with the teaching of this chapter, "as lambs among wolves" (<a href="/luke/10-3.htm" title="Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.">Luke 10:3</a>). St. Paul foresaw that in the very city from which St. John wrote this Gospel, "after his departing, grievous wolves would enter in among them, not sparing the flock" (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm" title="For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.">Acts 20:29</a>). These are the only passages in the New Testament where the word occurs, and from them we may gather that while wolves represent all false teachers and foes to truth, "<span class= "ital">the</span> wolf" represents him who is the source from whence they come. As all shepherds are related to the Good Shepherd, so are all wolves to <span class= "ital">the</span> wolf whose work they do. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in <a href="/mark/1-20.htm">Mark 1:20</a>). The hireling is contrasted with the shepherd. The protector of a flock, who, though, not a thief, or robber, or alien, yet has no unselfish regard for the sheep, is guilty of cowardice, and his shameless flight from danger may do as much harm to the flock as the thief or robber. Godet would, at all events at first, limit the reference to the priestly party, who ought to have had more courage and real care for the sheep, but were utterly unable to bear the brunt of assault from Sanhedrin and Pharisees. The latter represent, as he thinks, the ravening "wolf." But surely all who have merely mercenary or selfish motives in their treatment of souls, and who flee at the approach of danger or death, are here held up to grievous condemnation. All who proclaim themselves to be "the door of the sheep," who, independently of Christ, and without the animating breath of the Divine Spirit, are considering themselves rather than the flock which they profess to instruct and protect, are the hirelings here denounced. In the hour of real peril they turn and flee. "Whose own the sheep are not." They do not seek the destruction of the flock which is not theirs, but they neglect and forsake when they should be faithful unto death. They have not identified themselves with the object of their professed care. The <span class="accented">wolf</span> is the deadly power over seeking the destruction of the soul, and even compassing it; it is the metaphor for every sort of power opposed to Christ (cf. <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>; <a href="/luke/10-3.htm">Luke 10:3</a>; <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth</span> (them). "The seizing and scattering" shows how these hostile powers not only devastate, but destroy; not only crush individuals, but ruin Churches. The sheep do not belong to a hireling, as they do to a shepherd. No living bond of common interest links them to each other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
