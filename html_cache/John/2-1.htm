Its exact location is debated, but it is traditionally identified with modern-day Kafr Kanna.

Counting forward, the wedding falls on the third day of that sequence, anchoring the event in real history.<p>&#8226; Scripture often associates &#8220;the third day&#8221; with decisive acts of God (<a href="/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-11.htm">Exodus 19:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). John&#8217;s wording quietly points toward the ultimate third-day miracle of the Resurrection, hinting that every sign in Jesus&#8217; ministry is moving us toward that climactic victory.<p>&#8226; By opening His public signs on a &#8220;third day,&#8221; Jesus foreshadows the new life He will bring, transforming ordinary settings into stages for divine glory (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A wedding took place at Cana in Galilee</b><p>&#8226; Cana was a small Galilean village (<a href="/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>), underscoring that the Lord delights to manifest His glory in humble places, not only in Jerusalem&#8217;s grand courts.<p>&#8226; A wedding celebrates God&#8217;s first human institution (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). Jesus&#8217; presence affirms marriage as good, purposeful, and worthy of joy (<a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting prepares us for rich biblical imagery: Christ as Bridegroom (<a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>) and the Church as His bride (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>).

On a literal third day, in an actual Galilean village, at a real wedding attended by His own mother, Jesus steps into ordinary life to unveil extraordinary glory. The verse signals that He honors marriage, transforms common moments into redemptive milestones, and fulfills long-standing promises&#8212;setting the stage for every sign that will follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">II.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">The third day</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from the last note of time in <a href="/john/1-43.htm" title="The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.">John 1:43</a>, giving one clear day between the call of Philip and the day of the marriage.<p><span class= "bld">Cana of Galilee</span> has been identified with both <span class= "ital">Kanet el-Jelil,</span> or <span class= "ital">Khurbet Kanet,</span> and <span class= "ital">Kefr Kenna.</span> The monks of Nazareth and local tradition claim the latter place as the scene of the miracle, but this tradition has not been traced earlier than the seventeenth century, and the best modern authorities do not accept it. (But comp., in support of Kefr Kenna, Zeller in <span class= "ital">Report of Palestine Exploration Fund,</span> iii. 1869.) Kanet el-Jelil, on the other hand, is the rendering of the Arabic version, and Saewulf, as early as A.D. 1103, describes it as the place "where the Lord turned water into wine at the wedding" (<span class= "ital">Early Travels in Palestine,</span> p. 47). The strength of the argument is in the identity of name in the original, whereas Kenna is quite distinct. Travellers describe it as an obscure, uninhabited village in ruins. They were formerly shown the house where the marriage took place here, and even the water-pots, but these are now shown at the rival Kefr Kenna. The ruins are on the side of a hill looking over the plain of <span class= "ital">El Buttauf,</span> rather more than six miles to the N. or N.E. of Nazareth, and so answering Saewulf's description. It is some fifteen or sixteen miles from Tiberias and Capernaum, and six or seven more from Tell-Anihje. (Comp. <a href="/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>.) The writer knows the place by its common name Cana of Galilee, by which it was distinguished from the Cana of the tribe of Asher, S.E. from Tyre (<a href="/joshua/19-28.htm" title="And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Zidon;">Joshua 19:28</a>).

Christ had not yet given any "sign" of the invisible and eternal glory which the evangelist in his prologue had claimed for him. He had not in his own person "manifested" the unique majesty of his will, nor revealed the direction in which the power he wielded would most freely move.
