The context is important here, as it follows a series of teachings and miracles that Jesus performed, which led some to believe in His message. The term "Jews" in the Gospel of John often refers to the Jewish leaders or the people of Judea, but here it specifically refers to those who had expressed belief. This belief, however, is tested by Jesus' subsequent teachings, revealing that true belief requires more than initial acceptance. Historically, this interaction takes place in Jerusalem, a central hub of Jewish religious life, during the Feast of Tabernacles, a time when many Jews would be present in the city.<p><b>If you continue in My word</b><br>Continuing in Jesus' word implies a steadfast commitment to His teachings. This phrase emphasizes the necessity of perseverance in faith and obedience. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, discipleship was a lifelong commitment to follow a rabbi's teachings. Jesus is calling for a similar commitment, but to His divine teachings. This concept of abiding or continuing is echoed in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-7</a>, where Jesus speaks of abiding in Him as a branch abides in the vine. The idea of continuing in His word also connects to the Old Testament, where adherence to God's commandments was a sign of faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>).<p><b>you are truly My disciples</b><br>Here, Jesus distinguishes between mere followers and true disciples. True discipleship involves a deep, ongoing relationship with Jesus, characterized by obedience and transformation. This statement challenges the superficial belief of some of His listeners, urging them to examine the authenticity of their faith. The concept of discipleship in the New Testament is not just about learning but about living out the teachings of Jesus. This is further illustrated in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, teaching them to obey everything He has commanded. True discipleship is marked by a life that reflects the teachings and character of Christ, aligning with the prophetic vision of a new covenant where God's law is written on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing those who have believed in Him.

See also for this idea of abiding, Notes on <a href="/context/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37-38</a>. His word was the expression of the eternal truth of God, and He therefore was the one great Teacher. Every other must sit as a disciple at His feet, and continue in daily learning and in daily living to grasp the truth which, in that word and that word only, was revealed to man.<p>Here, as very frequently, part of the force of the sentence is expressed in the emphasis of the pronoun, "If <span class= "ital">ye</span> continue in My word." "Ye, on your part, ye who now believe, but have not the courage to rank yourselves openly among My disciples."<p><span class= "bld">Then are ye my disciples indeed.</span>--The insertion of "then" does not improve the rendering--"If ye continue in My word, ye are My disciples indeed." The words imply that He who reads the heart has no confidence in this momentary conviction, which will not stand the test of true discipleship, and all that this includes. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23-25</a>; <a href="/john/6-66.htm" title="From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.">John 6:66</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-59</span> describe a further conversation, not with the same audience. The words record a vivid conflict between the Lord and <span class="accented">the Jews who believed him</span>, who accepted the Messianic claims, but persisted in interpreting them, not by his word, but by their own ideas of the theocratic kingdom, by their privileges as children of Abraham, by their national animosity to their nearest neighbours the Samaritans, by their inability to press behind the veil of his humanity to his Divine nature. Their faith was of the most imperfect kind; but such as it was, it was made manifest to the observation of the apostle, and this throws light upon the fact that, among the many who <span class="accented">believed on him</span>, or rather alongside of these, there was a certain section of "the Jews," of the chief rulers and rabbis, who made a definite movement towards him. This doubtless excited the intense enthusiasm of the disciples, who might at once hope and almost expect that Jesus would with open arms accept their homage. But he at once puts this faith of theirs - perhaps ignorantly expressed - to a proof absolutely necessary for the salvation of his hearers. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">The test Christ supplied to those who admitted his testimony</span> - <span class="accented">true discipleship and freedom. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Jesus therefore said to the Jews who had believed him</span> - or, <span class="accented">had become believing</span>, and were now waiting for some special sign that their belief of his words was to be immediately rewarded by some closer conformity between his next step and their own prepossessions - <span class="cmt_word">If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my disciples.</span> Short of making the word of Jesus the resting place for both heart and intellect, full discipleship would be impossible. The true disciple receives and continues in the word of his Master. The expression expands and illustrates the difference between believing Christ to speak the truth, and believing in him. Many ancient Jews and modern Christians believe so much of Christ's word as is verified by their moral consciousness, and dispute or dispose of the rest as <span class="accented">Aberglaube.</span> The genuine disciple continues, abides, in the word of him who is the incarnate Word, yielding to it entire acquiescence, as the absolute reality of things, as the truth about God and man. He adds, <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall come fully to know the truth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to realize in the very depths of your being the trustworthy character of my word. "The Truth" (see <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) is one of the distinguishing names which Jesus takes to himself. He is <span class="accented">the Truth</span>, and "full of grace and truth." So far this statement corresponds with <a href="/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16, 17</a>. The "Jews" who had believed him would not feel the fiery ordeal and touch of flame applied to the sensitive skin of their pride and self-importance; but when he added, <span class="cmt_word">And the truth shall emancipate you,</span> the case was altered. Truth only can set the mind free from its bondage under ignorance and prejudice and evil habit. If the Light of the world shines into the dark places of the heart, the chains erewhile misunderstood will not only become visible, but will be broken. Godet beautifully says that "the empire of sin in a human heart is based upon an illusion, a fascination. Let truth shine, and the spell is broken, the will is disgusted with that which seduced it - 'the bird escapes from the net of the fowler.'" But this proffer of freedom to his disciples by continuing in his word was too startling a suggestion for their nascent and imperfect faith. He had told them that without faith in him they would die in their sins (ver. 24); now he assures them that, unless they abide steadfastly in his word, they will not escape from a bondage manifest enough to his eye, if not to theirs. This brings from them an angry response. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
