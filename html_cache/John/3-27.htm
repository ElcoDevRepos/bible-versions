His words come from a place of clarity about who he is and who he is not. Earlier he said, &#8220;I am not the Christ&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-20.htm">John 1:20</a>) and identified himself as &#8220;the voice of one calling in the wilderness&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>).

Do they mean "I cannot assume this higher position which you wish to give me, because it is not given me by heaven;" or, "His work, with its influence over men, ought to convince you that His mission is divine "? Expositors have given, now this, now that answer. The immediate connection with <a href="/john/3-26.htm" title="And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.">John 3:26</a> points to the latter view as the correct one (but see <span class= "ital">Alford's</span> Note on the other side). The power that had shown itself in word and work, teaching as none ever taught before, binding men--aye, some of their own brotherhood--to Himself, convincing men whose minds were open to the truth that He was the very Christ--all this could only have been received from heaven. Did they feel the movement around them? Let them recognise it as divine, and seek to be borne with it. (See Note on <a href="/john/6-36.htm" title="But I said to you, That you also have seen me, and believe not.">John 6:36</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-32.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The earthly and heavenly commission.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing</span> - neither office, function, faculty, nor life work, in the kingdom of God - <span class="cmt_word">except it has been given him from</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven.</span> The raying is broad, general, comprehensive, sustaining. It is not the glorification of success, but an explanation of the ground of high service. All good service, all high faculty, all holy mission, all sacred duty, are assigned to us by Heaven. "No man taketh this honour unto himself, unless he be called of God." Commentators have ranged themselves into three groups as to the primary application of the words. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Those who have limited the mental reference to John himself. "My function is, as I am about to explain, a subordinate one," "I have received that and nothing else from heaven." "I cannot make myself into the Bridegroom of the Church, or the Light of the world, or the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost." "I have received that only which is given and assigned to me by God." (So Bengel, Calvin, Hengstenberg, and at one time Godet.) <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Those who regard it as being a distinct reference to Christ, and as a vindication of Jesus from the complaint of John's own disciples. The high activity and present position of Jesus is declared by John to have been conferred on Christ "from heaven." He would not, could not, have taken it upon himself apart from the Divine order.
