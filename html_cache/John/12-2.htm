Hosting a dinner for Jesus signifies a gesture of honor and gratitude, especially following the miraculous raising of Lazarus from the dead (John 11). In Jewish culture, hosting a meal was a significant act of hospitality and fellowship, often used to honor a guest. This dinner also foreshadows the Last Supper, highlighting the importance of communal meals in Jesus' ministry.<p><b>Martha served,</b><br>Martha is consistently portrayed in the Gospels as a diligent and hospitable woman, often taking on the role of serving (<a href="/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38-42</a>). Her service here reflects her character and dedication to Jesus. This act of service is emblematic of Christian discipleship, emphasizing the importance of serving others as a form of worship and devotion to Christ.<p><b>and Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with Him.</b><br>Lazarus, recently raised from the dead by Jesus, is now a living testimony to Jesus' power over death. Reclining at the table was a common practice in Jewish and Greco-Roman culture during meals, indicating a relaxed and intimate setting. Lazarus' presence at the table symbolizes the new life believers have in Christ and serves as a foreshadowing of the resurrection hope for all who believe.

Notes on <a href="/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> and <a href="/mark/14-3.htm" title="And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.">Mark 14:3</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> which are clearly accounts of the same supper. Here the details peculiar to St. John, who was an eyewitness, will be noted. St. Matthew gives no indication of the day. St. Mark seems to place it two days before the Passover; but comp. Notes on <a href="/context/mark/16-1.htm" title="And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.">Mark 16:1-2</a>. Both the other accounts tell us that the supper was in the house of Simon the leper. St. John docs not define the place more definitely than to say that it was in Bethany; but he alone adds the facts that Martha was still serving, and that Lazarus was present as a guest.<p><span class= "bld">And Martha served.</span>--The tense of this verb differs from that of the others in the verse, and implies the continued act of serving, whilst "made a feast" is the statement of the fact as a whole. (Comp. <a href="/luke/10-40.htm" title="But Martha was encumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.">Luke 10:40</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</span>--This is a natural touch answering to the impression that the fact made. It is closely connected with the statement of the preceding verse, "Lazarus had been dead, whom he raised from the dead." Here was one sitting at meat with them who had lain in the sepulchre four days. The meal is in his case, as afterwards in that of our Lord Himself (<a href="/context/luke/24-41.htm" title="And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here any meat?">Luke 24:41-43</a>), a physical proof of the Resurrection; and his presence by the side of our Lord calls forth from Mary the anointing, which testifies to her gratitude and love. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There, therefore, they made him a supper, and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him</span>. John does not tell us in whose house "they made the dinner" or supper, and unless Simon the leper (<a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a> and <a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>) is a member of the family (or, as some suggest, the husband of Martha), we cannot suppose that it was in the quiet home of Bethany that this feast in honor of Jesus was held, but that it took place, as the synoptists positively declare, "in the house of Simon the leper." Simon may easily have been one of the many lepers whom our Lord had healed, and whose soul was filled with accordant gratitude. At that table there would be seated two transcendent; proofs of the power of Jesus to save, not only from the semblance but from the reality of death (see Meyer; <a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>). We wonder, with Godet, that Meyer should reject this simple supposition as "spurious harmony." All that is here stated is in agreement with it: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Martha should have shown her reverence by serving her Lord, according to her wont, not necessarily as hostess (Hengstenberg and Lange), but as the expression of her devoted thankfulness; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Lazarus should have been one of those who sat at meat, reclined at table, with him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> took a position as a guest, like himself; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that Mary should have poured forth her costly spikenard, in royal self-forgetting love. The conduct of all the three thus mentioned is compatible with the fact stated in the synoptic narrative, that the festival was celebrated in the house of Simon the leper. Our Lord had commented, in the house of Simon the Pharisee (<a href="/luke/7-44.htm">Luke 7:44</a>, etc.), on the absence of the customary anointing with oil. Mary knew of this, and resolved that, whatever the woman who was a sinner had done, no similar act of neglect should occur on that memorable evening. A chronological discrepancy renders an identification of the synoptic narrative of Matthew with this story perplexing. In <a href="/matthew/26-2.htm">Matthew 26:2</a> we are brought to within two days of the Passover, whereas here we cannot well be less than five days before it. However, there is nothing in <a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6-13</a> which indubitably declares the date of the <span class="accented">supper</span> The "two days" may refer to the date of Judas's treachery, after mentioning which he goes back to an event which furnished occasion and temptation to the avaricious mind of Judas. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
