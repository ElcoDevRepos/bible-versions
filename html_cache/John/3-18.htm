Belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior is the key to being free from condemnation. This aligns with <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, which states, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." The concept of belief here is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Jesus for salvation. In the cultural context of the first century, belief was often demonstrated through public confession and baptism, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>.<p><b>but whoever does not believe has already been condemned</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the stark contrast between belief and unbelief. The condemnation is not a future event but a present reality for those who reject Jesus. This echoes <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>, which states, "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him." The use of "already" indicates that unbelief is a state of being that results in separation from God, a theme consistent with the teachings of Jesus throughout the Gospels.<p><b>because he has not believed in the name of God&#8217;s one and only Son</b><br>The "name" in biblical terms often represents the character and authority of a person. Believing in the name of Jesus means accepting His divine nature and mission. The phrase "God&#8217;s one and only Son" underscores the unique and exclusive nature of Jesus' sonship, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, which describes Jesus as the "only begotten Son." This exclusivity is a cornerstone of Christian theology, affirming that salvation is found in no one else, as stated in <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>. The historical context of this claim would have been radical in a polytheistic society, asserting the singular path to God through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, referred to as "God&#8217;s one and only Son."

It cannot, then, fail to recognise and believe in a revelation of God. This revelation has been made in the only way in which it can be fully made (comp. <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>), in the person of the only begotten Son. The very fact that He is rejected is the judgment of the spirit which rejects. It has lost by neglect its power to perceive, or by will it hides itself from God. "I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself" (<a href="/genesis/3-10.htm" title="And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.">Genesis 3:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Salvation is the Divine result of believing on him, and salvation lifts the saved man from the necessity of the judgment, of the moral discrimination which awaits every man, and is passed upon every man by his own conscience and by the providence of God. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> does not necessarily mean "to condemn" (see ver. 17), and whensoever the unfavourable issue of judgment is emphatically referred to, then <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> used (<a href="/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a>; <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3</a>). Still, this first clause shows that the predominant sense in which it is used throughout the passage is condemnatory. <span class="cmt_word">He that believeth on him</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whoso submits and yields to the truth confessed and conspicuous in the Christ - he who accepts the mission of the Logos, both before and after the Incarnation (see notes on John 1:12-14) - <span class="cmt_word">is not judged.</span> If there be a judgment, it is one of acquittal. In his case judgment is salvation, salvation is the judgment. Faith, affectionate confidence in the supreme Judge, transforms the judgment into mercy, anticipates the Divine and gracious result. <span class="cmt_word">But he that believeth not</span> (subjective negative) <span class="cmt_word">has</span> <span class="cmt_word">been already judged,</span> and is now so adjudged (here the word seems necessarily to assume a condemnatory character) <span class="cmt_word">that he hath not believed on the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> Such non-belief reveals insensibility to truth, indifference to the reality of things, unsusceptibility to the light, and a moral perversity which has been persisted in. The approach to such a one of the Eternal Logos did not move him, the unveiling of the Divine face did not awe him into reverence. The sin of his life had blinded his eyes, closed his ears, hardened his heart, and the consequence was that when the Name of the only begotten Son was made known to him, like all previous Divine self-revelations, it exercised no commanding influence upon him, no convincing power, no saving grace. To refuse Christ, to manifest unbelief under such circumstances, proves that the laws of Divine judgment which are always going on have already enacted themselves. <span class="accented">He has been</span> (and <span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="accented">condemned.</span> He is "judged already," and the unbelief is the judgment which the self-acting moral laws, or rather which the Logos actively at work in every human being, pronounces upon him. The manner in which any man receives Divine revelation is the judgment passed upon his entire life up to that moment by the unerring and infallible wisdom of the supreme Judge. The final judgment is thus anticipated, but it is not irreversible, and, should repentance and faith supervene by Divine grace on this stolid indifference and damnable unbelief, the once unbeliever will become the believer, the judgment upon whom is no more a judgment of condemnation, but one of life and peace. Nothing can indicate a more untractable, unspiritual, and carnal state than a refusal to admit so great and imposing a manifestation of the Divine nature as the Name of the only begotten Son of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
