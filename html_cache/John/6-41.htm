The term "Jews" here typically refers to the Jewish leaders or those in opposition to Jesus, rather than the entire Jewish population. Grumbling echoes the Israelites' complaints in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>), highlighting a recurring pattern of disbelief and dissatisfaction with God's provision.<p><b>because He had said,</b><br>This phrase introduces the reason for their discontent. Jesus' statements often challenged existing beliefs and expectations, leading to tension and conflict. His teachings frequently required a shift from traditional interpretations of the Law and Prophets to a new understanding centered on His identity and mission.<p><b>&#8220;I am the bread that came down from heaven.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is a profound claim of divinity and fulfillment of Old Testament typology. The "I am" statement connects to God's self-identification in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, suggesting Jesus' divine nature. The imagery of bread from heaven recalls the manna provided to the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>), positioning Jesus as the true sustenance and life-giver.

Each of those moments unveiled His divine identity.<p>&#8226; Just as manna fell daily in <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4&#8211;5</a>, Jesus offers Himself as true, living provision.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a> invites, &#8220;Taste and see that the LORD is good,&#8221; a call now fulfilled in Christ&#8217;s own presence.<p>The crowd&#8217;s reaction occurs precisely after Jesus links the miracle of bread with His person, forcing them to choose between mere spectacle and genuine faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Jews began to grumble about Jesus</b><p>Grumbling is the heart&#8217;s verbal protest. Scripture consistently pairs it with unbelief:<p>&#8226; Israel &#8220;grumbled&#8221; in the wilderness when they doubted God&#8217;s care (<a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14</a> urges believers to &#8220;do everything without complaining,&#8221; contrasting faithful obedience with sour skepticism.<p>Here, the same spirit surfaces. Rather than marveling at Messiah, they mutter against Him, mirroring the ancient pattern of resisting God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because He had said,</b><p>Their issue is not a misunderstanding of His words&#8212;it is rejection of their meaning.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/john/8-45.htm">John 8:45</a> Jesus later states, &#8220;Because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31&#8211;32</a> records Peter rebuking Jesus for predicting His death; even disciples can balk at hard sayings.<p>The phrase underscores accountability: they heard, they understood, and they still objected.

With the true spirit of objectors, they do not regard what He has since said in explanation, but fasten upon what they do not understand in its most striking form. Perhaps they have not listened to what has followed; indeed, the words imply that they were for some time talking to one another, and interrupting His discourse, and that this led to His answering them. They are the Jewish authorities, representing, and probably in part consisting of, members of the Sanhedrin. (Comp.
