The setting is the Sea of Tiberias, also known as the Sea of Galilee, a familiar place for the disciples who were fishermen by trade. The act of sharing a meal is significant in Jewish culture, symbolizing fellowship and community. Jesus' invitation to breakfast demonstrates His continued care and provision for His disciples, reminiscent of His earlier feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/john/6.htm">John 6:1-14</a>). This meal also serves as a reminder of the Last Supper, where Jesus broke bread with His disciples, foreshadowing His sacrifice. The act of eating together reinforces the reality of Jesus' physical resurrection, countering any notion that He was merely a spirit.<p><b>None of the disciples dared to ask Him, &#8220;Who are You?&#8221;</b><br>The disciples' hesitation to question Jesus' identity suggests a mix of awe and recognition. Despite the miraculous nature of His resurrection, there is a familiarity in Jesus' presence that reassures them. This moment reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' promise that He would rise again and be with them (<a href="/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16-22</a>). The disciples' reluctance to ask further underscores their growing understanding and acceptance of Jesus' divine nature. It also highlights the transformation in their relationship with Him, moving from doubt and fear to faith and recognition.<p><b>They knew it was the Lord.</b><br>The disciples' recognition of Jesus as "the Lord" signifies their acknowledgment of His authority and divinity. This recognition is a culmination of their experiences with Him, from witnessing His miracles to hearing His teachings. The term "Lord" is significant, as it aligns with Old Testament references to God, affirming Jesus' identity as the Messiah. This moment of recognition is a turning point for the disciples, solidifying their faith and preparing them for their future mission to spread the Gospel. It also fulfills Jesus' earlier promise that they would see Him again and their joy would be complete (<a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ, appearing to His disciples by the Sea of Galilee, demonstrating His continued care and provision for them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus, specifically those who were fishing at the Sea of Galilee, including Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_galilee.htm">Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>The location where Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection, a familiar place of ministry and miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/breakfast.htm">Breakfast</a></b><br>A simple meal prepared by Jesus, symbolizing fellowship, provision, and the restoration of relationship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection_appearance.htm">Resurrection Appearance</a></b><br>This event is one of the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus, affirming His victory over death and His ongoing relationship with His followers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/invitation_to_fellowship.htm">Invitation to Fellowship</a></b><br>Jesus' invitation to "come, have breakfast" is a call to intimate fellowship with Him.

Now He beckons them to rest and be refreshed after a night of fruitless labor, just as He supplies both fish and fellowship (<a href="/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; choice of breakfast signals a new beginning. Dawn has broken, and with it comes renewed purpose for the disciples, previewing the fresh commission they will soon receive (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>; <a href="/luke/24-46.htm">Luke 24:46-48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus said to them</b><p>&#8226; The narrative stresses that the initiative is His. Even after the resurrection, He remains the Shepherd who pursues and leads His flock (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Speaking directly to them confirms His physical resurrection. Like earlier appearances where He ate fish in their sight (<a href="/luke/24-42.htm">Luke 24:42-43</a>), this meal underscores the bodily reality of His victory over death.<p>&#8226; His words bridge the gap between the spiritual and the ordinary. In Jesus&#8217; hands, everyday moments&#8212;casting nets, sharing food&#8212;become settings for revelation (<a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>None of the disciples dared to ask Him</b><p>&#8226; A holy hush falls over the scene. The same men who once argued about greatness now sit in reverent silence, overwhelmed by His presence (<a href="/mark/9-34.htm">Mark 9:34</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Fear here is not terror but awe&#8212;an awareness that they are in the company of the glorified Lord. Similar reverence is seen when John falls at Jesus&#8217; feet in <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>.<p>&#8226; Their restraint shows maturity. Earlier they were quick to question (<a href="/john/13-25.htm">John 13:25</a>; 14:8); now they simply receive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Who are You?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The unasked question highlights how unmistakable His identity has become. Resurrection appearances have dispelled doubt: Thomas has already confessed, &#8220;My Lord and my God!&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>).<p>&#8226; In other post-resurrection encounters, initial uncertainty gave way to recognition (<a href="/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16, 31</a>). Here that transition is complete; the question lingers only as a dramatic contrast to their certainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They knew it was the Lord</b><p>&#8226; Knowledge has moved from head to heart. Sight, sound, and shared bread confirm that the crucified Jesus is now the living Lord (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32-36</a>).<p>&#8226; This recognition is foundational for their coming mission. Before they can preach that Jesus is Lord, they must be fully convinced themselves (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Their certainty fulfills Jesus&#8217; promise: &#8220;I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>). Joy, confidence, and purpose flow from knowing Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12</a> captures a transformative moment: the risen Christ invites weary disciples to a simple meal that becomes a revelation of His living presence. His initiative, their reverent silence, and their settled conviction that &#8220;it was the Lord&#8221; together affirm His bodily resurrection, His ongoing shepherding care, and the new beginning He offers. Breakfast on the beach thus becomes a foretaste of the fellowship, assurance, and mission that define life with the resurrected Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine.</span>--Comp.

And no man after that dared ask him any question.">Mark 12:34</a>; <a href="/luke/20-40.htm" title="And after that they dared not ask him any question at all.">Luke 20:40</a>.) In all these instances it is used with a negative, and with a verb of inquiry, as here. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to them, Come and break your fast</span>.

He calls them to the repast. He becomes once more their Host and their Minister. Even still, metaphorically, he washes their feet. He attends to their requirements. He feeds them from this strangely bestowed supply. He joins them in their hunger for souls. He inspires their methods. He shares in their victory, after painful fruitless toil. <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> <span class="cmt_word">not one</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not even Thomas - <span class="cmt_word">of the disciples durst inquire of him</span> - put to him the interrogatory - <span class="cmt_word">Who art thou</span>? <span class="cmt_word">knowing</span>, each one of them <span class="cmt_word">that it was the Lord</span>.

These they possessed. A feeling of awe and reverence possessed them. They were of one mind about the marvelous revelation of himself to them. Some strange emotion sealed their lips. He had not manifested himself to the world, but to his disciples, and to them by "the interpretations they were putting upon their own experience" (Westcott). They knew it was the Lord. They looked into that other world. They were lost in silent amaze, and received the revelation once more of their risen Master and Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Come,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#949;&#8166;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Deute)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperative - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1205.htm">Strong's 1205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Come hither, come, hither, an exclamatory word.
