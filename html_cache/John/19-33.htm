The soldiers' approach to Jesus signifies the final stages of the crucifixion process. In Roman practice, crucifixion was a method of execution designed to prolong suffering, and the soldiers were tasked with confirming the death of those crucified.<p><b>and saw that He was already dead</b><br>The soldiers observed that Jesus had already died, which was unusual given the typical duration of crucifixion. This early death fulfills Jesus' own prediction of His death and aligns with the Gospel accounts that describe His final moments on the cross, including His declaration, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>). The fact that Jesus was already dead also fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/34-20.htm">Psalm 34:20</a>, which states that none of His bones would be broken.<p><b>they did not break His legs</b><br>Breaking the legs of those crucified was a common practice to hasten death, as it prevented the victim from pushing up to breathe, leading to asphyxiation. The decision not to break Jesus' legs is significant in fulfilling Old Testament prophecy, specifically <a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a> and <a href="/numbers/9-12.htm">Numbers 9:12</a>, which describe the Passover lamb, a type of Christ, whose bones were not to be broken.
