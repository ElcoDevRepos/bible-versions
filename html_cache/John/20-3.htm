His presence here underscores his importance in the early church. The "other disciple" is traditionally understood to be John, the author of the Gospel. This pairing of Peter and John is significant, as they are frequently mentioned together in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/3.htm">Acts 3:1, 8</a>:14). Their relationship highlights the balance between Peter's impulsive nature and John's contemplative character. This moment marks the beginning of their witness to the resurrection, a foundational event for Christian faith.<p><b>set out</b><br>The act of setting out indicates urgency and determination. The news of the empty tomb, delivered by Mary Magdalene, prompted immediate action. This reflects the disciples' deep connection to Jesus and their desire to understand the events unfolding. The urgency also signifies the importance of the resurrection in Christian theology, as it is the cornerstone of the faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>).<p><b>for the tomb</b><br>The tomb, located outside Jerusalem, was a new tomb belonging to Joseph of Arimathea (<a href="/john/19-41.htm">John 19:41</a>). Its location in a garden is significant, as gardens in Scripture often symbolize new beginnings and life (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>, <a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>). The empty tomb is a powerful symbol of Jesus' victory over death and the promise of eternal life for believers. The physicality of the tomb and its emptiness serve as tangible evidence of the resurrection, a central tenet of Christian belief.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong leadership among the apostles.

John, as the younger man, would soon outstrip the elderly disciple; and he simply records what in one sense is an insignificant detail, but one that could never be forgotten by him. There is no disposition to magnify himself, as Peter's part is obviously the more conspicuous.
