It aligns with <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. The use of "through Him" indicates that Jesus is the divine agent of creation, affirming His preexistence and divinity. <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> supports this by stating that all things were created through and for Him. This underscores the belief in the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet unified in essence and purpose. The phrase also reflects the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>, where wisdom is personified and present at creation, hinting at Christ's role.<p><b>and without Him nothing was made</b><br>This part of the verse reinforces the totality of Christ's involvement in creation. It negates any possibility of creation occurring independently of Him, emphasizing His sovereignty and indispensability. This echoes <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, which states that God made the universe through His Son. The phrase also counters early heresies like Gnosticism, which suggested a lesser deity or emanation was responsible for the material world. By affirming that nothing was made without Him, the text asserts the goodness of creation and Christ's authority over all.<p><b>that has been made</b><br>This phrase concludes the thought by encompassing all of creation, both seen and unseen.

It also points to the ongoing sustenance and governance of creation by Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, where He is described as upholding all things by His powerful word.

The Logos is the organ or instrument by which everything, one by one, was made. Two other words are used in the New Testament to denote "creation" - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, used in <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> and <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>, a word indicating the mind and act of the Creator; and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which, as in <a href="/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>, points generally to the thing made. The parts of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> indicate the progress of the work, the process of some creative order, the occurrence of some event in the evolution of Divine providence. This word does not by one solitary expression dogmatically convey the creative act, but the fact of the "becoming," from, it may be, the region of pure thought to that of existence, or from non-observation into prominence, or from an inchoate to a perfect development, or from nothing to something. The context must determine the fulness of its meaning. Occasionally, as in <a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, it is powerfully contrasted with existence: "Before Abraham was [had come into being] I am." The context here does not allow us to affirm that St. John repudiated the prior existence of the <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, stuff, of which <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> were made. He does not affirm nor deny such a prior existency or condition, but by referring the universe in all its parts and items to the <span class="accented">Logos</span>, he absolutely ignores the Platonic notion of eternal matter. He could scarcely be ignorant of the speculation as it entered into the Philonic interpretation and formed the basis of the Gnostic speculations which were beginning to infest the early Church. By giving, however, a Divine origin and instrument to the "becoming" of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, and strengthening his statement by the negative coassurance, he absolutely excludes the dualism of Philo and of Gnostic tendency. In asserting that the Logos is he or that through whom all things were made, the writer does not lower the dignity of the Logos by regarding him merely as the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Father, because the same preposition is used of the relation of the Father to the world or to his servants (<a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Elsewhere St. Paul powerfully affirms the same application of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>) to Christ's part in the Creation, reserving for the One God, the Father, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>. <span class="accented">From</span> God and <span class="accented">by</span> or <span class="accented">through</span> God are all things, still "all things" derive their existence "through" the activity, the will, the thought, of the Logos. "The sphere contracts as the blessing enlarges [query, 'intensifies']: existence for everything; life for vegetable and animal world; light for men" (Plummer). The same idea is made more explicit by the negative form in which it is restated: <span class="cmt_word">and without him -</span> that is, independently of his cooperation and volition (cf. <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">not even</span> <span class="cmt_word">one thing came into being.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> could hardly be spoken of as "one thing," seeing, according to the theory, it was not a unit as opposed to a multiplicity, but the condition of all things. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> would drive harder against any recognition of the <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> than would the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>. There is not the faintest approach to any supposition on John's part of the existence of such a primeval entity or eternal reality. The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> gives the student of the text and of the meaning grave difficulty. From very early times the Alexandrine Fathers and numerous uncial manuscripts, and an immense group of quotations and versions, unquestionably close the sentence we have just considered with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>, and consider the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as the subject of the following clause, translating it either, <span class="accented">That which has come into being in him was life</span>; or, <span class="accented">that which has come into being was</span> (or <span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="accented">life in him</span> - for one manuscript, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, has rendered the text more grammatical by reading <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. This, adopting the supposed early punctuation, Tregelles and Westcott and Hort have introduced into the text; but R.T. has coincided with T.R. Dr. Westcott has an elaborate note affirming the deep thought involved in the "ancient punctuation," to the effect that the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> refers, not merely to the original creation, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, but to the continued existence of that which has come into being. Of this, it is said, it derives its life, has its life in the Logos, and that this idea is expressed in a profounder way than by saying <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>; that it <span class="accented">was life</span> (before it was called into being, or became) <span class="accented">in him.</span> This profound and mysterious statement is affirmed by Dr. Moulton and Dr. Westcott to find different but clear expression in <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, "Thou art worthy, our Lord and our God, to receive glory, etc.; for thou didst create all things, and for thy pleasure they were [<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, the reading preferred by Tisehendorf (8th edit.) and Westcott and Herr, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, 'they are'] and were created." Dr. Westcott thinks that "life" here represents "the Divine element in creation, that in virtue of which things 'are' each according to the fulness of its being." What has been created represents the eternal thought, the life that it had in the Logos before the world was. Unless one were compelled to take this thought by the exigencies of the textual criticism, we should hesitate to affirm that this can be the author's intention. To us the common punctuation is far more satisfactory m meaning: <span class="accented">Apart from him there came into existence not one thing which has come into existence.</span> This, in its grand comprehensiveness and individualizing of every molecule and every force, brings the mind of the reader down from eternity to time, from the creation to the preservation and providence of the world, and it prepares the way for the great assertion of the following verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
