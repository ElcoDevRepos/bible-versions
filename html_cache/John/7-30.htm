The context of <a href="/john/7.htm">John 7</a> reveals that Jesus was teaching at the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival. The leaders were threatened by His teachings and the influence He had on the people. This attempt to seize Him reflects the fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, where the nations conspire against the Lord and His Anointed. The opposition to Jesus is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart among the religious authorities.<p><b>but no one laid a hand on Him</b><br>Despite their intentions, the leaders were unable to arrest Jesus. This demonstrates the divine protection over Jesus and the sovereignty of God in the unfolding of His redemptive plan. It also reflects the theme of divine timing, as seen in other parts of Scripture, such as in the life of David, where God&#8217;s protection is evident despite human threats (<a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>). The inability to lay a hand on Jesus underscores the truth that God&#8217;s purposes cannot be thwarted by human actions.<p><b>because His hour had not yet come</b><br>This phrase is significant in the Gospel of John, where "His hour" refers to the appointed time for Jesus' crucifixion and glorification. Throughout John&#8217;s Gospel, there is a recurring emphasis on the timing of Jesus&#8217; mission (<a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>, <a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>). This divine timetable is orchestrated by God, and not subject to human intervention. The concept of "His hour" also connects to the prophetic timeline of the Messiah&#8217;s suffering and ultimate victory, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. Jesus&#8217; awareness of His hour reflects His obedience to the Father&#8217;s will and His role as the sacrificial Lamb, fulfilling the types and shadows of the Old Testament sacrificial system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, whose divine mission and timing are emphasized.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people present at the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem, some of whom were hostile towards Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Feast of Tabernacles was taking place, a significant location for Jewish worship and festivals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A major Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' wilderness journey, during which Jesus was teaching.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_religious_leaders.htm">The Religious Leaders</a></b><br>Those who were seeking to arrest Jesus due to His teachings and growing influence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_timing.htm">Divine Timing</a></b><br>God's plans unfold according to His perfect timing.

Jesus continually faced opposition whenever His words challenged self-righteous traditions.<p>&#8226; The attempt also fulfills prophetic expectation that the Messiah would be &#8220;despised and rejected&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but no one laid a hand on Him</b><p>&#8226; Though they tried, not a single person could actually grab Him. <a href="/luke/4-30.htm">Luke 4:30</a> records a moment when Jesus &#8220;passed through the midst of them and went on His way,&#8221; underscoring divine protection.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/10-39.htm">John 10:39</a> repeats this pattern: &#8220;Again they tried to seize Him, but He escaped their grasp.&#8221; Human power is never sufficient to override God&#8217;s sovereign guard over His Son.<p>&#8226; This section underlines <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11-12</a>, where the Lord promises angelic oversight to prevent harm until the appointed moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because His hour had not yet come</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Hour&#8221; in John points to the divinely fixed time of Jesus&#8217; sacrificial death and subsequent glory (<a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>; 13:1; 17:1).<p>&#8226; Until that precise hour, He moved freely under the Father&#8217;s timetable. <a href="/john/8-20.htm">John 8:20</a> reiterates, &#8220;no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a> later affirms that Jesus was &#8220;delivered up by God&#8217;s set plan and foreknowledge,&#8221; showing His crucifixion was never random or subject merely to human scheming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a> demonstrates that hostile intent cannot thwart God&#8217;s sovereign plan.

The persons who thus sought to take Him are, of course, the members of the Sanhedrin. The people are mentioned in contrast in the next verse. For the present their efforts are confined to plots. No one attempts to use actual force.<p><span class= "bld">His hour was not yet come.</span>--This is the writer's explanation of the fact that they did not seek to take Him. Jesus had Himself used these words at the first sign at Cana of Galilee (<a href="/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>), and again before going up to this very festival (<a href="/john/7-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.">John 7:6</a>). The beloved disciple has learnt the religious interpretation of history. That the hour was not yet come, was not the immediate cause which influenced those who desired, but dared not, to lay hands upon Him. The next verse points out that there was a division in the multitude (comp. <a href="/context/john/7-43.htm" title="So there was a division among the people because of him.">John 7:43-44</a>), and in the uncertainty of what the consequences may be, no one was bold enough to take the decisive step. But if not the immediate cause, the writer regards it as the primary cause. Looking back on the life of his Lord, from the old age of his own life, so full of eventful issues, he has learnt that every deed of that life, as every deed of every life, had its hour mapped out in the eternal counsels of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30-36.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <span class="accented">The divided opinions and conduct of the different groups around him</span>; <span class="accented">the attempt on his life, and its failure.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They sought therefore to seize him: and</span> (equivalent to "but;" see ver. 28) <span class="cmt_word">no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.</span> It was in their heart to combine with "the Jews," but none dared to touch him. There were political considerations, there were lingering and coruscating fires of enthusiasm burning in the hearts of those who had seen his great works; and probably an awe, a superstitious fear, of some stroke of his reputed power held them back. The evangelist once more notices the true cause of this arrest of their malignity: "The hour" for the termination of his self-revelation, for the completion of his self-surrender, the hour which to the beloved disciple's eye was the very consummation of the ages, had not struck. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
