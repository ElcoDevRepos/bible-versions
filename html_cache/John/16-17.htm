It reflects a common human behavior of seeking understanding through peer discussion. The disciples often struggled to grasp Jesus' teachings, as seen in other instances like <a href="/mark/9-32.htm">Mark 9:32</a>, where they did not understand His prediction of His death and resurrection.<p><b>&#8220;Why is He telling us,</b><br>The disciples are questioning Jesus' words, indicating their lack of understanding of His mission and the events that were about to unfold. This reflects the broader theme of misunderstanding that runs throughout the Gospels, where Jesus' followers often fail to comprehend His teachings until after His resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p><b>&#8216;In a little while you will not see Me,</b><br>This phrase refers to Jesus' impending death and burial. The "little while" signifies the short period between His crucifixion and resurrection. The disciples were unaware of the exact timeline of these events, which added to their confusion. This phrase also connects to the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the Messiah's death.<p><b>and then after a little while you will see Me&#8217;</b><br>Here, Jesus is alluding to His resurrection. The "little while" after His death is the three days before He rises again. This promise of seeing Him again is a source of hope and foreshadows the joy of the resurrection, as later described in <a href="/john/20-20.htm">John 20:20</a> when the disciples see the risen Christ.<p><b>and &#8216;Because I am going to the Father&#8217;?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase refers to Jesus' ascension, which occurs after His resurrection. It signifies the completion of His earthly mission and His return to divine glory. The ascension is a pivotal event that fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, and is essential for the sending of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>).
