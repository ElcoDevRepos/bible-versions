This crowd likely consisted of Jewish people who were familiar with the teachings of the Law and the Prophets. Their reply shows a misunderstanding or confusion about Jesus' identity and mission, reflecting the common expectations of the Messiah at the time.<p><b>&#8220;We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever.</b><br>The crowd refers to the Law, which in this context includes the entire Hebrew Scriptures, not just the Pentateuch. They likely reference passages such as <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36-37</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, which speak of an everlasting kingdom. The Jewish expectation was that the Messiah would establish a permanent, earthly reign, which contrasts with Jesus' teachings about His death and resurrection.<p><b>So how can You say that the Son of Man must be lifted up?</b><br>The term "lifted up" is a reference to Jesus' crucifixion, as seen in <a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a> and <a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>. The crowd struggles to reconcile the idea of a suffering Messiah with their understanding of a triumphant, eternal ruler.

Despite Jesus' teachings and miracles, many struggled to see Him as the fulfillment of messianic prophecies. The question also highlights the tension between Jesus' revelation of Himself and the prevailing messianic expectations.

Earlier, others had tried to seize Him (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>), but on this occasion the crowd is sincerely wrestling with a theological dilemma.<p>&#8226; The timing is significant&#8212;Jerusalem is crowded for Passover. Expectations of national deliverance are high (<a href="/john/12-12.htm">John 12:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Their response reminds us that God&#8217;s revelation often presses believers to rethink settled assumptions (cf. <a href="/acts/10-13.htm">Acts 10:13-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever&#8221;</b><p>The &#8220;Law&#8221; can stand for the entire Old Testament.

Embracing both truths brings us face-to-face with the full, majestic portrait of our Redeemer&#8212;suffering Servant and reigning King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">we have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever.. . . . .</span>--The term "law" refers to the whole of the Old Testament Scripture, as we have seen in <a href="/john/10-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?">John 10:34</a>. (Comp. Note there.) They may have referred to such passages as <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm" title="His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.">Psalm 89:36</a>; <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13-14</a>. This remark is an instance of the knowledge of Rabbinic theology which interpreted such passages of a temporal Messianic reign. They had witnessed His triumphal entry into the royal city, and had joined in the acclamations which hailed Him as their King. They expected Him to free them from Roman bondage, and to rule over them in an earthly paradise to which there should be no end. The Christ they thought was to abide for ever.<p><span class= "bld">How sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted</span> up?--His words have conveyed to them the idea of His death, and we find "lifted up" used not unfrequently in the Rabbinical writings in this sense; but they do not understand more than this. It contradicts all their visions of a Messianic reign. The Son of man to be lifted up! What meant, then, such words as these--"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed" (<a href="/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>)? They cannot reconcile these things, and they ask Him to explain them. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - The audience of Jesus on this occasion has swollen into a vast group. The few Greeks, with Philip and Andrew, the other disciples, the smaller circle of sympathetic <span class="accented">listeners</span>, the disturbed and feverish crowd, are all about him, as he claims by death itself to judge the world, to win all men, and east out the spirit and prince of the world from his usurped throne. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude then</span> <span class="cmt_word">answered him, We heard</span> - received information by public teaching - <span class="cmt_word">out of the Law that the Christ abideth forever.</span> Numerous passages may have been reasonably in their minds - <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a> - in which the glories of an everlasting kingdom were predicted. In ver. 23 the Lord had in their hearing spoken of himself as "Son of man." Meyer, by giving the dominant sense of glorification to the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>, thinks <span class="accented">that</span> the people must be contrasting, in pert criticism, the lowly "Son of man" before them with the "Son of man" of Daniel's vision. But it would be far more probable that the people accepted Christ's intimation of the manner of his death, and hence felt the incongruity of such a Son of man - One who dies, and therefore lives again - with the glowing pictures of Daniel or the 'Book of Henoch.' "The Christ abideth forever." <span class="cmt_word">And how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span> They did not identify "the Son of man" with the Messiah. They probably supposed two manifestations. They may have doubted, as John the Baptist did, whether Jesus had fulfilled the whole conception of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It was once more a vague, dull inquiry, "Who art thou?" We are still in doubt who thou art, and how thou canst claim to be the Christ of our prophecies. To be our Christ, and die, is a contradiction in terms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
