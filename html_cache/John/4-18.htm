In the cultural context of first-century Samaria, having multiple husbands could indicate a history of personal tragedy, such as widowhood or divorce, which was often stigmatized. The Samaritans, though related to the Jews, had distinct religious practices and were often looked down upon by the Jewish people. This background sets the stage for Jesus' interaction with her, breaking social norms by speaking to a Samaritan woman. The number five may also symbolize incompleteness or imperfection, contrasting with the completeness found in Christ.<p><b>and the man you now have is not your husband</b><br>This statement addresses the woman's current living situation, suggesting a relationship outside the bounds of marriage. In the biblical context, living with someone who is not one's spouse was considered sinful, reflecting a departure from the covenantal understanding of marriage. This situation underscores the woman's need for spiritual renewal and redemption, which Jesus offers. It also highlights Jesus' omniscience, as He knows her circumstances without prior knowledge, demonstrating His divine insight.<p><b>You have spoken truthfully.</b><br>Here, Jesus acknowledges the woman's honesty in her response to Him. This affirmation is significant, as it shows Jesus' appreciation for truthfulness, even when it reveals personal shortcomings. It also serves as a turning point in their conversation, leading to a deeper revelation of Jesus' identity as the Messiah. This moment of truth is pivotal, as it opens the door for the woman to receive the living water Jesus offers, symbolizing eternal life and spiritual fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is engaging in a conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well, revealing His divine knowledge and offering her living water.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_woman.htm">Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>A resident of Sychar in Samaria, she encounters Jesus at Jacob's well.
