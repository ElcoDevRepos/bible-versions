This moment foreshadows Peter's impending denial of Christ, highlighting his fear and uncertainty. The door symbolizes a barrier between Peter and the events unfolding inside, where Jesus is being interrogated. This setting is likely the courtyard of the high priest, a place of significant tension and danger for Jesus' followers. Peter's hesitation to enter reflects the perilous environment for the disciples after Jesus' arrest.<p><b>Then the disciple who was known to the high priest went out</b><br>The disciple referred to is traditionally understood to be John, the author of the Gospel. His acquaintance with the high priest suggests a connection to the Jewish religious elite, possibly through family or business ties. This relationship grants him access to the high priest's courtyard, a privilege not extended to all. This detail underscores the diverse backgrounds of Jesus' followers and the varying degrees of influence they possessed. It also highlights the providence of God in placing individuals in strategic positions to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and spoke to the doorkeeper,</b><br>The doorkeeper, likely a servant or guard, controlled access to the high priest's residence. This role was crucial in maintaining security and order, especially during a high-profile event like Jesus' trial. The disciple's ability to converse with the doorkeeper indicates a level of trust and authority, allowing him to advocate for Peter's entry. This interaction reflects the social hierarchies and protocols of the time, where personal connections could override standard procedures.<p><b>and brought Peter in.</b><br>The act of bringing Peter in signifies a moment of inclusion and solidarity among the disciples, despite the looming threat. It demonstrates the disciple's willingness to risk his own safety to support Peter. This gesture also sets the stage for Peter's subsequent denial, emphasizing the tension between loyalty and fear.

That women "kept the door" among the Jews we know from Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant</span> vii. 2, ? 1).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Peter was standing at the door without</span>. Up to this moment Peter had only pressed as far as to the outer door; the other disciple had gone bravely in. The hum of voices was now deadened by the closed door dividing Peter from his Lord. The height, the cold, the strange blighting of all his expectations, the necessary conviction forced upon him that he had implicated himself by the assault he had delivered on the servant of the high priest, combined to induce a new and desponding mood. All hope had fled. Then John bethought him of the condition of his friend, and so we read that <span class="cmt_word">the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, therefore went out</span> to the entrance-door, and finding Peter there, <span class="cmt_word">spake to her who kept the door</span> (cf. <a href="/acts/12-13.htm">Acts 12:13</a>). His appeal may easily be supplied - <span class="cmt_word">and he brought in Peter</span>. The other evangelists imply that before Peter was challenged the fire of coals had been lighted, and that the apostle, with the servants and with the rest of the group who had apprehended Jesus gathered round it. He placed himself as if he were an unconcerned spectator, identified himself, as it were, rather with the captors than with the Lord; nor is the narrative of John inconsistent with the synoptic statement. In Ver. 18 the incident is certainly introduced by the writer after he mentioned the challenge. Still, he states it as a condition of the denial rather than as a subsequent event. Matthew describes his position as "without, in the court," not in the audience-chamber, but in a court opening "upon" it or "above" it, as Mark (<a href="/mark/14-66.htm">Mark 14:66</a>) implies. Luke tells us he was "sitting m the midst of the court," with the glow of the burning charcoal on his face, "he was <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>," where the maiden might see him more attentively than when she hurriedly admitted him. "The other disciple" had moved swiftly on to some corner where he could see and hear all that was happening to the Master. But Peter's first step downwards had been already inwardly taken. Before he had verbally denied his Lord, he had acted as though he were indifferent to the result (see Hanna's 'Last Day of our Lord's Passion,' <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2</a>.). Matthew's and Mark's accounts represent Peter's first and other denials as taking place after the mockery of Jesus that followed upon his great confession of Messiahship. Luke places them all three together before the formal examination or confession, and before the judicial condemnation. John's account throws much needed light upon the synoptic narrative, which is more inconsistent with itself than with that of the Fourth Gospel. Matthew's method of putting together into connected concurrent groups miracles, events, sayings, or parables which are allied to each other, will explain the substantially identical report contained in his and Mark's Gospels. There are with all differences some remarkable coincidences. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> All four accounts describe our Lord's prediction of Peter's denial. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> All four evangelists agree to represent the first temptation as proceeding from "a certain maiden," "one of the maids of the high priest," or "a damsel." John's Gospel explains the point by saying, <span class="cmt_word">the maid who kept the door</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">said therefore</span>, seeing she had admitted him, not in the rush of the other servants, but at the request of "the other disciple" - considerable meaning is thus put into her words, which is lost in the synoptists by lack of the hint already given By John - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou</span>, as well as my acquaintance yonder, <span class="cmt_word">also one of this Man's disciples? He saith, I am not</span>. The other evangelists amplify this negative in various ways. Mark, the reporter of Peter's own preaching, aggravates throughout the heinousness of Peter's fall, adding, "He denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest."
