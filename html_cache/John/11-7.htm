The disciples were often privy to Jesus' plans and teachings, which were not always shared with the larger crowds. This moment follows the news of Lazarus's illness, showing Jesus's intention to involve His disciples in His mission. The disciples often struggled to understand Jesus's actions and teachings, reflecting the human tendency to question divine plans. This interaction underscores the importance of discipleship and the close relationship between Jesus and His followers.<p><b>&#8220;Let us go back to Judea.&#8221;</b><br>Judea was a region where Jesus had previously faced significant opposition, particularly from the religious leaders. Returning there posed a risk, as the last time Jesus was in Judea, the Jews had attempted to stone Him (<a href="/john/10-31.htm">John 10:31</a>). This decision to return demonstrates Jesus's courage and commitment to His mission, despite the danger. It also foreshadows His ultimate sacrifice, as Judea is the region where He would later be crucified. This journey back to Judea is a step towards fulfilling His purpose, showing His willingness to face persecution for the sake of God's plan. The mention of Judea connects to the broader narrative of Jesus's ministry and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah's suffering and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is preparing to return to Judea despite the potential danger, demonstrating His commitment to His mission and His love for Lazarus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are with Him during His ministry.
