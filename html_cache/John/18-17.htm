The "servant girl" is likely a young female servant responsible for managing access to the courtyard of the high priest. This setting is significant as it highlights the vulnerability and fear of Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, in a hostile environment. The presence of a servant girl questioning Peter underscores the unexpected nature of the challenge to his loyalty, as it comes from someone of low social status, not a figure of authority.<p><b>Aren&#8217;t you also one of this man&#8217;s disciples?</b><br>The question posed by the servant girl is direct and confrontational. It implies that Peter's association with Jesus is known or suspected, reflecting the tension and danger for Jesus' followers at this time. The use of "this man" rather than Jesus' name may indicate a dismissive or derogatory attitude, common among those who opposed Jesus. This moment fulfills Jesus' earlier prophecy that Peter would deny Him three times before the rooster crowed (<a href="/john/13-38.htm">John 13:38</a>), highlighting the theme of human weakness and fear.<p><b>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; he answered.</b><br>Peter's denial is significant as it marks a moment of personal failure and fear. Despite his earlier bold declarations of loyalty (<a href="/john/13-37.htm">John 13:37</a>), Peter succumbs to fear of association with Jesus. This denial is a pivotal moment in Peter's spiritual journey, illustrating the struggle between faith and fear. It also serves as a reminder of the grace and forgiveness available through Christ, as Peter is later restored and becomes a foundational leader in the early Church (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-19</a>). This denial contrasts with Jesus' unwavering commitment to His mission, even in the face of suffering and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and later leadership in the early church.
