It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which speaks of a virgin bearing a son called Immanuel, meaning "God with us." The concept of the Word (Logos) was familiar in both Jewish and Greek thought, representing divine reason and creative order. By becoming flesh, Jesus bridged the divine and human, emphasizing His role as the mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>and made His dwelling among us.</b><br>The term "dwelling" is reminiscent of the Old Testament tabernacle, where God's presence resided among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>). This suggests that Jesus is the new tabernacle, the place where God's presence is fully realized. The Greek word used here, "skenoo," implies pitching a tent, indicating a temporary but significant presence. This highlights the historical reality of Jesus' life on earth and His intimate involvement with humanity.<p><b>We have seen His glory,</b><br>The glory of Jesus is a manifestation of His divine nature, witnessed by His disciples through His miracles, teachings, and ultimately His resurrection. This glory is akin to the Shekinah glory of God that filled the tabernacle and later the temple (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). The eyewitness testimony of the apostles, such as Peter, James, and John at the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-8</a>), underscores the reality of this divine glory.<p><b>the glory of the one and only Son from the Father,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unique relationship between Jesus and God the Father. The term "one and only" (Greek: "monogenes") indicates Jesus' unique status as the only begotten Son, distinct from all creation. This relationship is central to understanding the Trinity, where Jesus shares the same divine essence as the Father. The Father-Son relationship is foundational to the Gospel message, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>.<p><b>full of grace and truth.</b><br>Jesus embodies the fullness of grace and truth, qualities that reflect God's character. Grace refers to the unmerited favor and love of God, while truth signifies reliability and faithfulness. These attributes are seen in Jesus' interactions with people, His teachings, and His sacrificial death and resurrection. The combination of grace and truth fulfills the law given through Moses, as Jesus brings a new covenant that surpasses the old (<a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word.htm">The Word (Logos)</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the pre-existent divine Word who became incarnate.

This signifies the incarnation, where the divine Word became fully human while remaining fully divine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dwelling.htm">Dwelling</a></b><br>The Greek word (skenoo) is used here, meaning "to tabernacle" or "to pitch a tent," indicating God's presence among His people, reminiscent of the Old Testament tabernacle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/glory.htm">Glory</a></b><br>Refers to the divine presence and majesty of God, which was visible in Jesus.

Man came to be a son of God, because the Son of God became man. They were not, as the Docetae of that time said, believers in an appearance. "The Word was made flesh." The term "flesh" expresses human nature as opposed to the divine, and material nature as opposed to the spiritual, and is for this reason used rather than "body," for there may be a purely spiritual body (see Note on <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-40.htm" title="There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.">1Corinthians 15:40-44</a>); and rather than "man," which is used in <a href="/john/5-27.htm" title="And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.">John 5:27</a>; <a href="/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>, for of man the spiritual is the highest part. It is not the approach of the divine and human nature in the region of the spiritual which is common to both that strikes the writer with wonder, but that men should have power to become sons of God, and that the Word, of whose glory he has spoken in the earlier verses, should become flesh. (Comp. <a href="/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6-8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.">2Corinthians 8:9</a>, Notes.)<p><span class= "bld">Dwelt among us.</span>--The Greek word means "tabernacled." "sojourned" among us. It was, probably, suggested by the similarity of sound with "Shekhinah," a term frequently applied in the Targums or Chaldee Paraphrases, though the substantive nowhere occurs in the Old Testament itself, to the visible symbol of the divine Presence which appeared in the Tabernacle and the Temple. The Targums, moreover, frequently identify the Shekhinah with the "Memra" or Word. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Excursus A.</span>) The thought, then, of this Presence brings back to the writer's mind the days and weeks and months they had spent with the Word who had pitched His tent among them. He had been among the first to follow Him, and of the last with Him. He had been of those who had seen the glory of the Transfiguration, who had entered with their Master into the chamber of death, who had been with Him in the garden of Gethsemane. His eye, more than that of any other, had pierced the veil and gazed upon the Presence within. And now the old man, looking forward to the unveiled Presence of the future, loves to think and tell of the past, that the Presence may be to others all it had been to him. He is conscious that the statement of this verse needs evidence of no common order; but this is present in the words and lives of men whose whole moral being declared it true, and the test is within the power of all. (Comp. especially 1 John 1) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <span class="accented">The incarnation of the Logos. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And the Logos became flesh.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> has been variously expanded, some giving it the force of "then" or "therefore," as though John was now resuming the entire argument from the beginning; others the sense of "for," as though the apostle needed to introduce a reason or justification for what had been said in vers. 12, 13. It is enough to regard the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> as a simple copula, after the same manner in which it is used in vers. 1, 4, 5, 10, introducing by it a new and suggestive truth or fact which must be added to what has gone before, qualifying, illumining, illustrating, consummating all previous representations of the activity and functions of the Eternal Logos. Meyer, rejecting all the explicative modifications of the copula, nearly approaches the emphasis which Godet would lay upon it, by saying, "John cannot refrain from expressing the how of that appearing which had such blessed results (vers. 12, 13), and which he had himself experienced." The circumstance that in this verse the author goes back to the verbal use of the great term <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> suggests rather the fact that the fourteenth verse follows directly upon the stupendous definitions of ver. 1, and indicates a powerful antithesis to the several clauses of that opening sentence. The Logos which <span class="accented">was</span> in the beginning has now <span class="accented">become</span>; the Logos which was <span class="accented">God</span> became <span class="accented">flesh</span>; the Logos that was <span class="accented">with God</span> has <span class="accented">set up his tabernacle among us.</span> If so, the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> does suggest a parenthetical treatment of vers. 2-13, every clause of which has been necessary to prepare the reader for the vast announcement which is here made. Various things, relations, and powers have been asserted with reference to the Logos. All things <span class="accented">became</span> through him; not a single exception is allowed. Not one thing can be, or can have come into existence, independently of him; yet he is not said in any sense to have "become all things." More than that, the twofold form of the expression stringently repudiates the pantheistic hypothesis. All life is said to be "in him," to have its being in his activity; yet he is <span class="accented">not</span> said to have <span class="accented">become life</span>, as if the life-principle were henceforth the mode of his existence, or a state or condition into which he passed, and so the emanation theories of early Gnostics and of modern pantheistic evolutionists are virtually set aside. "The veritable Light which lighteth every man" is the illumination which the <span class="accented">Life</span> pours on the understanding and conscience of men, to which all prophecy bears witness; but he is not said to have <span class="accented">become</span> that light. Thus the incarnation of the Logos in every man is most certainly foreign to the thought of the apostle. He is said to have been "in the world" which he made, yet in such manifestation and concealment that the world as such did not apprehend the wondrous presence; and he is said also to have been continually coming to his own people "in sundry times" and "divers manners," in prophetic visions and angelic and even the anthropic form or fashion. Elsewhere in this Gospel we hear that Abraham "saw his day," and Isaiah "beheld his glory;" but it is not said that he <span class="accented">became, i.e.</span> entered into permanent and unalterable relations with these theophanic glories. Consequently, the deep self-conscious realization of the glory of his Name, enjoyed by greatest saints and sages of the past, was but a faint adumbration of what John declared he and others had had distinct historical opportunity of seeing, hearing, handling, of that Word of life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1, 2</a>). The statement of this verse, however, is entirely, absolutely unique. The thought is utterly new. Strauss tells us that the apostolic conception of Jesus can have no historic validity, because it represents a state of things which occurs nowhere else in history. <span class="accented">This is exactly what Christians contend for.</span> He is in the deepest sense absolutely unique in the history of mankind. Moses, Isaiah, John the Baptist, John the Apostle, Socrates, Buddha, Zoroaster, may have borne witness to the Light; but of not one of them can it be said, and at least it was not said or even imagined by St. John, the Logos became flesh in their humanity. Yet this is what he did think and say was the only explanation of the glory of Jesus; this unspeakable relation to the Eternal Logos was sustained by his well known Friend and Master. And the <span class="accented">Word was made flesh. Flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, answering in the LXX. to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) is the term used to denote the whole of humanity, with prominent reference to that part of it which is the region of sensibility and visibility. The word is more comprehensive than (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) "body," which is often used as the antithesis of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; for it is unquestionable that the conventional use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, includes oftentimes both soul and spirit - includes the whole of human constitution, yet that constitution considered apart from God and grace, answering in this way to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The flesh is not necessarily connotative of sin, though the conditions, the possibilities, the temptableness of created finite nature are involved in it. It is nearly equivalent to saying <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, generic manhood, but it is more explicit than such a dictum would have been. It is not said that the Word became a man, although "<span class="accented">became man"</span> is the solemn and suggestive form in which the great truth is further expressed in the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed. "<span class="accented">The Logos became flesh."</span> Thus it answers to numerous expressions in the Pauline Epistles, which must have been based in the middle of the first century on the direct and well preserved teachings of our Lord himself (<a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>; Romans 8:3, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>; cf. <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>; and above all <a href="/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2</a>, where Jesus Christ, the centre of whose personality is the Logos, and is there used in the most transcendent sense, is there spoken of (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) as having come in the flesh). Very early in the Christological discussions, even so far back as Praxeas whom Tertullian sought to refute, and by Apollinaris the younger, in the fourth century, it was said that this passage asserted that, though the Logos took or became flesh, he did not become or take upon himself the human <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the reasonable soul or spirit of man, but that the Logos took the place in Jesus of the mind or spirit. Apollinaris explained, in vindication of his view, that thus Christ was neither God nor man, but a blending of the two natures into a new and third nature, neither one nor the other. This view was stoutly resisted by Athanasius and Basil. It reappeared in the fifth century, in the form of Eutychianism, to do duty against the twofold Christ of Nestorianism. The opponents of Praxeas, Apollinaris, and Eutyches were all fain to show that the Gospel of John calls marked attention to the human soul of Jesus (<a href="/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>) and of his human spirit (<a href="/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a>; <a href="/john/13-21.htm">John 13:21</a>; <a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), to say nothing of <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>, where "he learned obedience," etc. The flesh of Christ is constitutive and inclusive of his entire humanity. Flesh itself is not human flesh without the human <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, nor can there be a human soul without human spirit. The two terms are used interchangeably, and their functions are not to be regarded as different factors of humanity so much as different departments of human activity. There is a complete humanity, therefore, included in this term, not a humanity destitute of one of its most characteristic features. But the question arises - What is meant by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, "became, was made"? A considerable number of modern Lutheran divines have laid such emphasis on the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the "emptying" of his glory on the part of him who was "in the form of God," that nothing short of an absolute depotentiation of the Logos is supposed to have occurred when "he was made flesh" or "man." Gess and Godet have pressed the theory that the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> represents a complete transubstantiation and metamorphosis. Thus Logos had been God from eternity, but now, in the greatness of his humiliation, he was no longer Logos at all, nor God, but flesh; so that during the time of the Incarnation the Logos was absolutely concealed, potential only, and that even a consciousness of his eternity and the Divine powers were all in absolute abeyance. This hypothesis, on both its Divine and human side, appears to us hopelessly unthinkable. If the Logos was no longer Logos, and the Godhead thus ineffably truncated, the very argument of the apostle that in him was life and light, etc., must break down. The sources of life and light must have been themselves in eclipse, and God himself was no longer God. Moreover, the hypothetical obliteration of the Logos would deprive the whole argument of the apostle for the Divineness and Godhead of the Lord of its basis in fact. There are many different forms in which this meaning of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> is urged, but they all break to pieces upon the revelation of the self-consciousness of Jesus Christ, the Divine memories and awful centre of his personality, in which the nature of the Godhead and the perfect nature of manhood are blended in one personality. Moreover, the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> does not imply annihilation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or transubstantiation of <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. When the water was made (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) wine, the water was not obliterated, but it took up by the creative power of Christ other substances into itself, constituting it <span class="accented">wine.</span> So when the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> became "flesh," he took up humanity with all its powers and conditions into himself, constituting himself "the Christ." The question arises - Wherein was the humiliation and the <span class="accented">kenosis</span>, if the Logos throughout the incarnate life of Christ, as a Person, possessed and exercised all his Divine energies? The answer is, that, in taking human nature in its humbled, suffering, tempted form into eternal, absolute union with himself, and by learning through that human nature all that human nature is and fears and needs, there is an infinite fulness of self-humiliating love and sacrifice. Hypostatic union of humanity with the Logos, involving the Logos in the conditions of a complete man, is an infinite humiliation, and seeing that this involved the bitterest conflict and sorrow, brought with it shame, agony, and death, such a stupendous fact is (we believe) assumed to have taken place once in historic time. It is far more than the manifestation in the flesh of Jesus of the Divine light and life. Such an hypothesis would merely consider Jesus as one supereminent display of "the veritable Light which lighteth every man," whereas what is declared by St. John is that the Word himself, after a new exercise of this infinite potency, became flesh. We are not told <span class="accented">how</span> this occurred. The fact of the supernatural birth, as stated by the synoptic writers, is their way of announcing a sublime secret, of which John, who was in the confidence of the mother of Jesus, gave a profounder exposition. In such a fact and event we see what St. Paul meant when he said that in the depths of eternity the infinity of love did not consider the undimmed, unclouded, and unchangeable creative majesty of equality with God to be a prize which must never be relinquished, but emptied himself, was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and was found in fashion as a man. There was now and forevermore a part of his being in such organic union with "flesh" that he could be born, could learn, could be tempted, suffer from all human frailties and privations, die the death of the cross. The phrase, moreover, implies that the Incarnation was in its nature distinct from the Docetic, angelic, transitory manifestations of the older revelation. In the "Word" becoming "flesh" both Word and flesh remain side by side, and neither is the first nor the second absorbed by the other, and so Monophysitism is repudiated, while the statement of what the Word thus incarnate did, viz. "dwelt among us," etc., cuts away the support of the Nestorian division of the Divine and human natures; inasmuch as what is said of the one nature can be said of the other. To this we turn: "And the Word was made flesh, and <span class="cmt_word">set up his tabernacle in our midst</span>." The use of this picturesque word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> points to the tabernacle in the wilderness, in which God dwelt (<a href="/2_samuel/7-6.htm">2 Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>, etc.), and to which reference is made in <a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37-28.htm">Ezekiel 37:28</a>. The localization of Deity, the building a house for the Lord whom the heaven of heavens could not contain, was a wondrous adumbration of the ultimate proof to be given, that, though God was infinitely great, he was yet capable of turning his glorious face upon those who seek him; though unspeakably holy, awful, majestic, omnipotent, he was yet accessible and merciful and able to save and sanctify his people. The glory of the Lord was the central significance of the tabernacle and temple worship. It was always assumed to be present, even if invisible. The Targums in a great variety of passages substitute for the "glory of the Lord," which is a continuous element in the history of the old covenant, the word "Shechinah," "dwelling," and use the term in obvious reference to the biblical use of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, he dwelt, when describing the Lord's familiar and accessible sojourn with his people. It is too much to say that John here adopts the Aramaic phrase, or with certainty refers to it. But <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> recalls the method by which Jehovah impressed his prophets with his nearness, and came veritably to his own possession. "Now," says John, "the Word made flesh took up his tabernacle in our midst." It is not to be forgotten that John subsequently shows that Jesus identified his body with "the temple" of God (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>, etc.). The "<span class="accented">us"</span> represents the ground of a personal experience which makes the hypothesis of an Alexandrine origin for the entire representation perfectly impossible. The reference to the old covenant is made more conspicuous: <span class="cmt_word">And we contemplated his glory.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> corresponds with the visible manifestations of the presence of Jehovah under the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>; <a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). Dazzling light at the burning bush, in the pillar of fire, on Mount Sinai, at the dedication of tabernacle and temple, etc., revealed the awful fact of the Divine nearness. The eye of believing men saw the real glory of the Logos made flesh when he set up the tabernacle of his humanity among us. It does not follow that all eyes must have seen what the eye of faith could see. The darkness has resisted all the light, the world has not known the Logos; the susceptibilities of believing men enabled them to perceive the glory of the Lord in regions and by a mode of presentation to which unregenerate men have not attained. The apostles saw it in the absolute moral perfection of his holiness and of his charity; of his grace and truth. We can scarcely exclude here a reference to the wondrous vision upon which (as we learn from Matthew, Mark, Luke) John himself gazed on the Mountain of Transfiguration, when the venerable symbol of <span class="accented">Light</span> reappeared from within the person of the Lord, so linking his personal manifestation of "the Word" with the theophanies of the Old Testament; nor can we forget the sublime vision which John undoubtedly records in the beginning of his Apocalypse. Nevertheless, the glory which the apostles beheld must be distinct from the "glory" which he had with the Father before the world was, and to which (<a href="/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>) he prayed that he might return, and the full radiance of which he would ultimately turn upon the eyes of the men whom he had gathered "out of the world." Before that consummation "we," says he, "contemplated his glory <span class="cmt_word">as of an only begotten</span>." The <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> implies comparison with the transcendent conception which had entered into his inspired imagining. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is used by John to refer to the supreme and unique relation of the Son to the Father (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16, 18</a>, and <a href="/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9</a>). It is used of human sons in Luke (<a href="/luke/7-12.htm">Luke 7:12</a>; <a href="/luke/8-42.htm">Luke 8:42</a>; <a href="/luke/9-38.htm">Luke 9:38</a>), and <span class="accented">unigenitus</span> is the translation in the Vulgate of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, where the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, well beloved (see <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span> <a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2, 12, 16</a>). It corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a> and <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>, showing that an analogous thought filled the apostolic mind. By laying stress here on the "glory," and giving historic value and emphasis to the supernatural conception of Jesus, many see in this a reference to the Incarnation wherein he became an only begotten Son of the Father. This would be far more probable if the article had been placed before <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>. Here the apostle seems to labour to express the glory of One who could thus stand in the eternal relation of the Logos to <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, making it correspond with the relation also subsisting between <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and the "Father." Great speciality and peculiarity is here bestowed upon the "only begotten," as it stands in close relationship with those to whom he gives power or capability to become "children of God." They are born into the family of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The glory which John says "we beheld" in his earthly flesh was the effulgence of the uncreated beam which broke through the veil of his flesh, and really convinced us that he was "the Word made flesh." The Tubingen critics see a contradiction here with the prayer of Christ (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 24</a>) for "the glory which he had with the Father." If he shone on earth with such glory as John here describes, why should he desire more? Godet resolves it by insisting on the moral glory of his filial consciousness when he had indeed deprived himself of his Divine perfections. Thus Godet repudiates the two natures of his Person. There is no real contradiction, as we have seen. Some difference of opinion occurs also as to the reference of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Some nave referred <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> to the <span class="accented">Father</span>, and some to <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>, though in both cases a break in the construction would be involved, as the antecedent would have been in the genitive. Others, again (founding on the reading of one uncial manuscript, D, which here has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;</span>), refer it to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and all who thus construe eschew any parenthetical treatment of the previous clause. The latter method is freer from difficulty, as then this clause, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is directly and grammatically related with <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Word was made flesh, and, full of grace and of truth, set up his tabernacle in our midst. Grace and truth are the two methods by which the glory as of "an only begotten" shone upon us, and we beheld it. The combination of these two ideas of grace and truth pervades the Old Testament description of the Lord (cf. <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10, 11</a>; <a href="/psalms/61-7.htm">Psalm 61:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>). "Grace," the free and royal communication of unlooked for and of undeserved love, is the keynote of the New Testament. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ" is the compendium of all his powers of benediction, and corresponds with the <span class="accented">life</span> which is "in him," and all the gift of himself to those who came into contact with him. "Truth" is the expression of the thought of God. Truth <span class="accented">per se</span> can find no larger definition than the perfect revelation of God's eternal thought concerning himself and his universe, and concerning the relations of all things to each other and to him. That which God thinks about these things must be "truth <span class="accented">per se."</span> Christ claimed to be "the Truth" and "the Life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), and John here says that it was in virtue of his being the Logos of God that he was full of these. Grace and truth, love and revelation, were so transcendent in him; in other words, he was so full, so charged, so overflowing with both, that the glory which shone from him gave apostles this conception about it, viz. that it was that of an only begotten (specially and eternally begotten) and with the Father. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> of ch. 17:5, and does not, therefore, necessarily suggest more than the premundane condition, answering to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 1, and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 18. Erasmus, Paulus, and a few others have associated the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., with the following verse. This is eminently unsatisfactory as unsuited to the character of the Baptist. Moreover, the sixteenth verse, by its reference to Christ's "fulness," positively forbids it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
