In the Gospel of John, these signs include turning water into wine (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>), healing the official's son (<a href="/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46-54</a>), and raising Lazarus from the dead (<a href="/john/11.htm">John 11:1-44</a>). The signs were public and undeniable, witnessed by many, including skeptics and believers alike. The Jewish expectation of the Messiah included the performance of miraculous signs, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the blind seeing and the lame walking. Despite the fulfillment of these prophecies, the people's hearts were hardened, echoing the pattern seen in the Old Testament where Israel often witnessed God's mighty works yet remained unbelieving (e.g., <a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>).<p><b>they still did not believe in Him</b><br>This phrase underscores the persistent unbelief of the people despite the clear evidence of Jesus' divine nature and mission. This unbelief fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being rejected despite His revelation. The hardness of heart is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in Pharaoh's resistance to God's signs through Moses (Exodus 7-11). Theologically, this unbelief can be understood as a result of spiritual blindness, a condition that Jesus often addressed (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>). The rejection of Jesus by His contemporaries also serves as a type of the broader rejection of God by humanity, highlighting the need for divine intervention and grace for true belief to occur. This unbelief, despite clear evidence, is a sobering reminder of the spiritual battle and the necessity of the Holy Spirit's work in opening hearts to the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, performing signs and miracles to reveal His divine nature and mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people who witnessed Jesus' miracles but remained unbelieving, representing a broader human tendency to doubt despite evidence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs.htm">Signs</a></b><br>Miracles performed by Jesus, intended to authenticate His divine authority and mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting for many of Jesus' final teachings and miracles, a city with deep spiritual significance in Jewish history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unbelief.htm">Unbelief</a></b><br>A recurring theme in the Gospel of John, highlighting the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart among those who reject Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_unbelief.htm">The Nature of Unbelief</a></b><br>Despite clear evidence of Jesus' divine power, many still chose not to believe.

The people did not hear rumors; they saw with their own eyes:<p>&#8226; Feeding five thousand from five loaves and two fish (<a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Giving sight to a man born blind (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Healing multitudes in Capernaum &#8220;at evening&#8221; right in front of them (<a href="/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32&#8211;34</a>).<p>- First-hand exposure leaves no room for &#8220;insufficient evidence.&#8221; As John opens his first letter he says, &#8220;what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes&#8230; and our hands have touched&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>).<p>- God makes His work observable so that faith is grounded in reality, not wishful thinking.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they still did not believe in Him</b><p>- Spiritual blindness, not lack of data, lies at the heart of unbelief. &#8220;This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah: &#8216;Lord, who has believed our message?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>).<p>- Jesus already diagnosed the issue: &#8220;Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>).<p>- Repeated refusal hardens the heart (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12&#8211;13</a>).

A humble, surrendered heart is essential.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a> shows that overwhelming evidence of Jesus&#8217; divine power does not guarantee belief.

The passage invites every reader to move beyond mere observation of God&#8217;s works to personal trust in the Son He has unmistakably revealed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">But though he had done so many miracles before them.</span>--The words "before them" mean "in their presence," "before their eyes."

St. John's narrative implies, therefore, that the "signs" of the earlier Gospels were well known. He has himself recorded but six miracles, and all these, with the exception of the feeding the five thousand, belong to the Judaean ministry. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Yet</span> <span class= "bld">they believed not on him.</span>--This is the writer's comment on the general result of Christ's work at the close of His public teaching. This too is said of the multitude, the people as a whole. There were, of course, not a few who were then walking according as they had light, but it was not so with the many. Rejection and not acceptance was the result of Christ's personal work on earth; yet rejection accompanied, as on this day, by signs which pointed to a world-wide acceptance. "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name" (<a href="/context/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37-43.</span> - <p><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The <span class="accented">reflections of the evangelist</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though he had done so many signs in their presence, yet they believed not on him,</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> is discriminated from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, Plat., 'Gorgias,' p. 456, c.
