The disciple leaning back is traditionally understood to be John, the beloved disciple, indicating a close relationship with Jesus. This physical closeness symbolizes spiritual intimacy and trust. The setting is significant as it takes place during the Passover meal, a time of remembrance and anticipation of God's deliverance, which Jesus fulfills as the Lamb of God.<p><b>he asked</b><br>The act of asking shows the disciple's desire for understanding and clarity. In the context of the Last Supper, Jesus had just announced that one of the disciples would betray Him, creating an atmosphere of tension and uncertainty. The disciple's question reflects a personal concern and a need for reassurance from Jesus. This moment highlights the importance of seeking truth directly from Christ, who is the source of all wisdom and knowledge.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, who is it?&#8221;</b><br>The use of "Lord" signifies recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity. The question "who is it?" pertains to the identity of the betrayer, Judas Iscariot, which fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where a close friend would turn against the Messiah. This inquiry underscores the theme of betrayal and the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan through human actions. It also serves as a reminder of the spiritual vigilance required to discern truth and remain faithful to Christ amidst trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah.

"He then leaning thus . . . ," describes the action just as it took place (comp. Note on <a href="/john/4-6.htm" title="Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.">John 4:6</a>); but the balance of authority is against the insertion. The action is, however, exactly described in the original, for the words "lying" and "breast" are both different from those in <a href="/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>. The English preserves this difference, but hardly conveys the full meaning. There the beloved disciple is described as reclining towards his Master's bosom. Here he leans upon (or leans back upon, as many good authorities read), the Master's breast, and asks Him the question, "Who is it?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He, leaning back as he was against the breast of Jesus, saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</span> Meyer explains, "He, raising himself from the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of Jesus to his breast, nearer to his ear, draws close to him, and asks in a whisper."
