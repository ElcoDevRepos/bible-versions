It echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>, where God instructs Israel to be open-handed toward the poor and needy. The statement reflects the socio-economic conditions of the time, where poverty was widespread and systemic. Jesus is not dismissing the importance of caring for the poor; rather, He is emphasizing the perpetual need for compassion and charity. This phrase also highlights the ongoing responsibility of believers to care for the less fortunate, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>).<p><b>but you will not always have Me.</b><br>Here, Jesus is foreshadowing His impending crucifixion and departure from the world. This statement underscores the unique and limited opportunity the disciples had to be in His physical presence. It emphasizes the significance of His earthly ministry and the urgency of recognizing His divine mission. The phrase also points to the transition from Jesus' physical presence to the spiritual presence through the Holy Spirit, as promised in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>. This moment is a reminder of the prophetic nature of Jesus' life and mission, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah (Isaiah 53, <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples and others present.

(See Notes there.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - This verse is omitted in D, but abundantly attested here.

As though he had said, "After this very night, the opportunity to offer me affectionate attention or symbolic homage, to give expression to feelings in accordance with just presentiments as to my mission, will be over forever, and belong to the irrecoverable past - <span class="accented">Now</span> <span class="accented">or never!</span> She has done this thing, she will have everlasting remembrance thereby." The frankincense of the Wise Men, the ointment of Mary, the homage of the Greeks, were symbols, and can never be repeated. The greatest motive for generous and affectionate interest in the poor is that they represent the Lord; but they are not to be rivals of the Lord himself. Westcott remarks, "The promise of the future record of the act of love is omitted by the one evangelist who gives the name of the woman who showed this devotion to her Master." Moulton, "The very charity that cares for the poor whom we see has been kept alive by faith in and devotion to the crucified Redeemer whom we cannot see." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
