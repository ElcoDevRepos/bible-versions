In biblical symbolism, "daytime" often represents a period of opportunity and divine presence. Jesus, the Light of the World, is present, and His works must be accomplished while He is with His disciples. The concept of "day" as a time for work is rooted in Jewish culture, where daylight hours were traditionally used for labor.<p><b>we must do the works of Him who sent Me</b><br>The use of "we" indicates a collective responsibility shared by Jesus and His followers. The "works" refer to the divine mission and miracles that testify to Jesus' identity and authority. The phrase "Him who sent Me" underscores Jesus' divine commission from the Father, aligning with passages like <a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>, where Jesus speaks of the works given to Him by the Father as a testimony to His divine mission. This highlights the unity and purpose between Jesus and God the Father.<p><b>Night is coming</b><br>"Night" symbolizes a time when Jesus will no longer be physically present to perform His works, pointing to His impending crucifixion and death. In a broader sense, it can also refer to spiritual darkness and the absence of opportunity to witness and work for the Kingdom. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to night as a time of danger or absence of God's presence, such as in <a href="/john/11-10.htm">John 11:10</a>.<p><b>when no one can work</b><br>This phrase indicates a period when the opportunity to perform the works of God will be hindered or impossible. It serves as a warning to the disciples and believers to seize the moment and fulfill their mission while they have the chance. The urgency is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a>, which encourages believers to make the most of every opportunity because the days are evil.

The clause would read then, <span class= "ital">We must work the works of Him that sent Me</span> (or <span class= "ital">us</span>)<span class= "ital"> while it is day.</span> He identifies the disciples with Himself in the redemptive work of His mission. There is before them a striking instance of the power of evil. He and they are there to manifest the power of good. They must gird themselves to the task. If we are right in placing the whole section from <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a> to <a href="/john/10-21.htm" title="Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?">John 10:21</a> on the same great day of the Feast (comp. Note on <a href="/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>), then this work must have come near the close of the day. The sun sinking to the west may have reminded them that the day was passing away, and that the night was approaching. He was reminded of the day of life, and the night of death. He will not be long in the world (<a href="/john/9-5.htm" title="As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.">John 9:5</a>). That night will be the close of His human work, and the shadows of evening are already falling upon Him.<p><span class= "bld">The night cometh, when no man can work.</span>--He does not except even Himself from the proverbial law. The day of opportunity passes, never to return. His own great work of doing the work of Him that sent Him, could only be done when that day was present. It has, of course, been ever done in the work of His church under the guidance of His Spirit; but the work of His own human activity on earth ceased when the night came. Comp. <a href="/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.">John 11:9</a> for this thought of the hours of the day. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We</span> <span class="cmt_word">must work the works of him that sent me</span>, <span class="cmt_word">while it is day.</span> The emendation of the text certainly throws much beauty into the statement. Christ identifies himself with his disciples. They are pledged by accepting his call, and he has been himself charged by his own sublime mission to work while it is called day. The sun was going down over the holy city on that sabbath day, and Jesus will not wait, nor lose the opportunity of doing the merciful will of the Father. He did not say, "Him that sent <span class="accented">us"</span> (as Tischendorf reads), for "As the Father had sent him, so <span class="accented">he</span> sent them." But he adds, <span class="cmt_word">The night cometh, when no man can work.</span> The materialistic interpretation of Paulus, "Christ must have daylight for a delicate operation," is too puerile to deserve refutation. The suggestion of the Greek Fathers (Chrysostom, Theophylact, etc.), who here drew a distinction between the work of this world and the work of the future world, between work done before and after his Passion, representing the work of his earthly ministry as done in the day, and that of the Spirit as work done in the night, is singularly unfortunate. Our Lord is merely adopting the phrase as a customary image for life and death. Death puts an end to all human activity on earth, even to Christ's own, as a human Friend and Teacher. Numerous attempts have been made to suppose some emphatic contrast between the lifetime of Christ and the period that should follow his Passion. They all fail, because Christ's own activity resumes another form by his resurrection and the gift of his Spirit. The night of death, accompanied by the cessation of active labor, is the general idea. The day's work must be done in the day. The probation involved in the bare fact of its limitation, and in this case its rapidly approaching consummation, is the main thought, without pressing the imagery too far. By saying, "We must work," etc., he gave a lesson and an example for all time. The 'Pirke Aboth,' "The Sayings of the Fathers," record the words of R. Tryphon, "The day is short, and the task is great, and the workmen are sluggish, and the reward is much, and the Master of the house is urgent." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7957;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2193.htm">Strong's 2193: </a> </span><span class="str2">A conjunction, preposition and adverb of continuance, until.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
