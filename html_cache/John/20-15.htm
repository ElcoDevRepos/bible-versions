The term "woman" is a respectful form of address in the cultural context of the time. The question "why are you weeping?" highlights the sorrow and confusion Mary feels after discovering the empty tomb. This moment reflects the deep personal connection and care Jesus has for His followers, as He seeks to comfort her in her distress. The weeping also symbolizes the grief of humanity before the realization of the resurrection.<p><b>Jesus asked.</b><br>This indicates that it is Jesus who is speaking, though Mary does not yet recognize Him. The fact that Jesus is the one asking the question is significant, as it shows His active role in revealing Himself to His followers post-resurrection. This moment is a turning point where the risen Christ begins to make Himself known, fulfilling His promise of resurrection.<p><b>Whom are you seeking?</b><br>This question goes beyond the immediate context, inviting Mary to reflect on her understanding of Jesus' identity. It echoes earlier moments in the Gospel where Jesus asks His disciples about who they believe He is, prompting deeper faith and recognition. The question also serves to gently guide Mary towards the realization that Jesus is not dead but alive, challenging her expectations and understanding.<p><b>Thinking He was the gardener, she said,</b><br>Mary's assumption that Jesus is the gardener is significant both literally and symbolically. The garden setting recalls the Garden of Eden, suggesting themes of new creation and restoration. The misunderstanding also highlights the transformed nature of Jesus' resurrected body, which is not immediately recognizable. This moment underscores the theme of spiritual blindness and the need for divine revelation to truly see and understand Jesus.<p><b>Sir, if you have carried Him off,</b><br>Mary's address of "Sir" shows respect and her earnest desire to find Jesus' body. Her assumption that someone might have moved Jesus' body reflects the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the resurrection. This phrase captures the human tendency to seek logical explanations for divine mysteries, illustrating the struggle to comprehend the miraculous.<p><b>tell me where you have put Him,</b><br>Mary's request is a plea for information, driven by her devotion and love for Jesus. Her desire to know where Jesus' body is reflects her commitment to honor Him even in death. This moment highlights the personal relationship between Jesus and His followers, as well as the deep sense of loss and longing that precedes the joy of resurrection.<p><b>and I will get Him.</b><br>Mary's determination to retrieve Jesus' body demonstrates her devotion and willingness to serve, even in the face of overwhelming grief. This phrase underscores the personal commitment and love that characterize true discipleship. It also foreshadows the revelation that will soon transform her sorrow into joy, as she will come to understand that Jesus is not to be found among the dead, but is alive.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus who was present at His crucifixion and was the first to see Him after His resurrection.

Now the risen One Himself asks whom she seeks, underscoring that the quest ends in a Person, not in a place.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Thinking He was the gardener, she said, &#8220;Sir, if you have carried Him off, tell me where you have put Him, and I will get Him.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Mary&#8217;s mistaken assumption highlights the ordinariness of Jesus&#8217; resurrection appearance; He is not radiant in heavenly splendor but approachable, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>&#8217;s description of humble appearance.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;gardener&#8221; detail roots the event in the same garden setting where the tomb lay (<a href="/john/19-41.htm">John 19:41</a>). Symbolically, the Second Adam (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>) stands in a garden, reversing the curse incurred by the first.<p>&#8226; Her offer to retrieve the body shows steadfast devotion and courage; a woman prepared to carry a lifeless corpse will soon carry the news of life to the apostles (<a href="/john/20-18.htm">John 20:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Like the disciples on the Emmaus road, whose eyes &#8220;were kept from recognizing Him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16</a>), Mary&#8217;s recognition awaits a personal revelation&#8212;when He calls her by name (<a href="/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a>; cf. <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3-4</a> &#8220;He calls his own sheep by name&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The narrative underscores that faith comes not by sight alone but by the Lord&#8217;s initiative in opening eyes and hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus meets Mary in her tears, asks questions that draw out her longing, and reveals how her limited expectations give way to resurrection reality. Grief is acknowledged, hope is redirected, and devotion is rewarded when the risen Savior calls her name. <a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a> shows a compassionate Lord who turns mourning into joy and invites every seeker to discover that the One we seek is alive and present.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Sir, if thou have borne him hence . . .</span>--The word rendered "Sir" is generally a mark of respect, but like the corresponding word in most languages, was also used to a stranger, and even to an inferior. The "gardener," moreover, corresponded more to what we should call a "bailiff." He would have been a servant of Joseph of Arimathaea, and as such may have become known to Mary at the time of embalming. She says, with emphasis, "If <span class= "ital">thou</span> hast borne Him hence;" turning away from the angels to address him. The word rendered "borne" here means properly "to bear," and then "bear away," "remove," and then "remove secretly." (Comp. <a href="/john/12-6.htm" title="This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein.">John 12:6</a>.) Of this last meaning there are many undoubted examples in Josephus, and this seems clearly to be the thought here.<p><span class= "bld">Tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away</span> .--Three times she refers to the Lord simply by the pronoun "Him." She has named Him in the previous verse, and perhaps thinks that the gardener had heard those words; but the impression formed from her eager words is that her own mind is so entirely filled with the one subject, that she supposes it to be in the minds of others. The same passionate eagerness is heard in the words which follow. Devotion such as hers does not weigh difficulties. A place of safety for that sacred body is the object of her will; and that will neither dreads danger nor sees that the task would be physically impossible, but asserts in the confidence of its own strength, "and <span class= "ital">I</span> will take Him away."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to her</span>, in the words of the angels, <span class="cmt_word">Woman, why weepest thou?</span> These are the first words of the risen Jesus, for Mark tells us, "He appeared first of all to Mary of Magdala." And Matthew's summation of the entire narrative makes it clear that she was at least one of the first group who saw the risen Lord. He recalls her to herself. He seeks to assuage the grief of desolation, the bitterness of despairing love. As his first great Beatitudes had been "Blessed are the poor in spirit," "Blessed are those who mourn and weep," and "Blessed are the meek," so the first words he uttered after he rose from the dead were intended to console human weeping over the most irremediable of human sorrows. They are the beginning of a fulfillment of the Divine promise "to wipe away tears from off all faces." But the Lord adds, <span class="cmt_word">Whom seekest thou</span>? She has lost some one, not some thing. Questions these which he has been asking the souls of men and women ever since, when their grief and tears, their unconscious and unsatisfied yearnings after himself, have confused their perceptions and riven their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">She, supposing him to be the gardener</span>, a friend, not a stranger, a disciple, not a Roman soldier or a hostile priest, perhaps some man who had been with Joseph of Arimathaea on the Friday evening, or even the senator himself, <span class="cmt_word">said to him, Lord</span>, (Sir,) <span class="cmt_word">if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</span> This passionate burst reveals the blinding dominance of a fixed idea. She had no notion of the Resurrection. She was utterly overwhelmed with one bitter, cruel thought. The sacred body was to be embalmed with the precious spices which she had spent her all to buy. Others have forestalled her. Perhaps unsympathizing hands have been doing their worst. She does not know, in her terrified grief, if some wicked hands have not cast out his body into the Valley of Hinnom. She seems to imply that the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> has heard the words of the angels, and her previous reply to them. She is so filled with one thought, that the him, not it, explains itself. She is reckless of herself, and does not stay to count the cost. Had she not poured the precious ointment on his feet, in happier days, and washed them with her tears? Of whom can she speak but of him who said, "Thy sins, which are many, are forgiven;" "She loved much;" "Thy faith hath saved thee"? So far all is preparation for the great revelation. "The Lord has risen indeed;" but, unlike what poetry or theology might have pictured, or the mythopceic faculty have woven out of its strong persuasion of the Lord's indissoluble life, he has chosen first of all to present this signal manifestation of spiritual corporeity to a loving heart crushed with grief, to one groaning over irreparable wrong, without a spark of hope, that death was indeed vanquished. But she who received the objective presentation was too much preoccupied to feel her footing and her home in two worlds. It was not "an enthusiast (une hallucinee, Renan) who gave the world (un Dieu ressuscite) a resuscitated God," but a doubter, a despairing, broken-hearted sufferer, who did not know him when she saw him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Woman,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#915;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Gynai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1135.htm">Strong's 1135: </a> </span><span class="str2">A woman, wife, my lady.
