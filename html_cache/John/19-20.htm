This was a common practice in Roman crucifixions to display the charge against the condemned. The fact that many Jews read it indicates the public nature of the crucifixion and the significant number of people present. This event took place during Passover, a time when Jerusalem was filled with Jewish pilgrims from various regions, increasing the number of witnesses.<p><b>because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city</b><br>Jesus was crucified at Golgotha, also known as "the Place of the Skull," which was located just outside the city walls of Jerusalem. Roman executions were typically held in prominent locations to serve as a public deterrent. The proximity to the city ensured that many people, including those entering and leaving Jerusalem, would see the crucifixion and the sign. This location fulfills the typology of Jesus as the sacrificial lamb, as sacrifices were made outside the camp in the Old Testament (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>).<p><b>and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek</b><br>The trilingual inscription highlights the universality of Jesus' kingship. Hebrew was the language of the Jewish people and their religious texts, Latin was the official language of the Roman Empire, and Greek was the lingua franca of the Eastern Mediterranean. This ensured that the message could be understood by a diverse audience, symbolizing the reach of Jesus' message to all nations. The use of these three languages also reflects the cultural and political context of the time, with Roman authority, Jewish religious tradition, and Greek cultural influence all intersecting in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the crucifixion, whose identity and mission are proclaimed through the inscription on the cross.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>The local population who witnessed the crucifixion and read the inscription.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_place_of_crucifixion.htm">The Place of Crucifixion</a></b><br>Near the city of Jerusalem, emphasizing the public nature of Jesus' death.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/languages.htm">Languages (Aramaic, Latin, Greek)</a></b><br>The inscription was written in these three languages, representing the diverse audience and the universal significance of Jesus' crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor who ordered the inscription, highlighting the political and religious tensions of the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The use of three languages signifies the Gospel's reach to all people, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/public_declaration_of_jesus'_kingship.htm">Public Declaration of Jesus' Kingship</a></b><br>The inscription serves as a public proclamation of Jesus' identity, inviting all to recognize His authority and kingship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_irony_of_the_cross.htm">The Irony of the Cross</a></b><br>While intended as a mockery, the inscription truthfully declares Jesus as King, illustrating God's sovereignty in using human actions for divine purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_witnesses.htm">The Role of Witnesses</a></b><br>The presence of many witnesses underscores the historical reality of the crucifixion and the importance of testimony in the Christian faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/language_and_communication_in_evangelism.htm">Language and Communication in Evangelism</a></b><br>The multilingual inscription challenges believers to communicate the Gospel effectively across cultural and linguistic divides.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_19_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 19:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_three_languages_in_John_19_20.htm">Why was the inscription written in three languages in John 19:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/John_19_20_God_s_universal_Gospel_plan.htm">How does John 19:20 demonstrate God's plan for spreading the Gospel universally?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/OT_prophecies_linked_to_John_19_20.htm">What Old Testament prophecies connect to the events in John 19:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_clearly_convey_Christ_s_message.htm">How can we ensure our actions communicate Christ's message clearly to all?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_19_20_Cultural_understanding_s_value.htm">What does John 19:20 teach about the importance of understanding diverse cultures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_Hebrew_Latin_Greek_in_John_19_20.htm">Why was the inscription written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek in John 19:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_19_20_Jesus_universal_message.htm">How does John 19:20 reflect the universality of Jesus' message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_3_languages_used_in_John_19_20.htm">What is the significance of the languages used in John 19:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/day_21_insights_on_spiritual_growth.htm">What events transpired during the crucifixion of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_did_the_cross_inscription_say.htm">What was the wording on the cross in the Gospels?

The word <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> occurs four times in this Gospel and twice in the Revelation, and nowhere else in the New Testament. Codex B reads <span class="greek">&#x1fec;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> first. The Latin form of the trilingual inscription may very naturally have been placed at the top. The reference to this peculiarity of the inscription as also given by Luke, in T.R., is there omitted by Tischendorf (8th edit.), Tregelles, Westcott and Herr, and R.T., M'Clellan, and others; it looks as if the reading had been borrowed from John, or rather from the spurious 'Acts of Pilate,' with which it verbally agrees. The proclamation of Christ's royalty to the three great divisions of the civilized world is a providential fact of supreme interest. Thousands of Jews would carry the news of the mysterious "title" to far-off places, and ponder it in their homes. This was part of the preparation made by Divine providence for announcing to the whole world the kingdom of Jesus Christ. Since the cross from the very first thus became a throne, and the Crucifixion an installation into the kingdom, we learn thence the meaning of the Christian principle, "If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Many</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(polloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4183.htm">Strong's 4183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many; often. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
