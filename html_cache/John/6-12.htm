The setting is near the Sea of Galilee, a region known for its agricultural activity, yet the provision here is supernatural.

It also reflects the rabbinic tradition of teaching through action, preparing them for their future roles as leaders of the early Church.<p><b>Gather the pieces that are left over</b><br>The act of gathering leftovers underscores the importance of stewardship and the value of God's provision. In Jewish culture, it was customary to collect leftovers to avoid waste, reflecting a respect for God's blessings.
