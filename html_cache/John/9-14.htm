This act of healing is significant as it demonstrates Jesus' authority over physical ailments and His power to restore sight, both physically and spiritually. The use of mud can be seen as a symbolic act, reminiscent of God's creation of man from the dust of the ground in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, highlighting Jesus' divine nature and creative power. This miracle is one of the signs in the Gospel of John that reveal Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God.<p><b>was a Sabbath.</b><br>The mention of the Sabbath is crucial in understanding the conflict between Jesus and the Jewish religious leaders. The Sabbath, a day of rest and worship, was strictly observed by the Jews, based on the commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>. By performing this miracle on the Sabbath, Jesus challenges the Pharisees' legalistic interpretation of the law, emphasizing the spirit of the law over its letter. This act highlights Jesus' authority over the Sabbath, as He declares in <a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a> that "the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath." The healing on the Sabbath also foreshadows the new covenant, where Jesus fulfills the law and offers rest and restoration to all who believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who performs the miracle of healing the blind man.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was blind from birth and received his sight through Jesus' miraculous intervention.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, which is significant in this passage as it highlights the tension between Jesus' actions and the Pharisaic interpretation of the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders who are often depicted as opposing Jesus, particularly in matters of law and tradition.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, it is the broader setting for many of Jesus' interactions with the Pharisees.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sabbath.htm">Understanding the Sabbath</a></b><br>The Sabbath is a gift from God meant for rest and worship, not a burden of legalistic restrictions.

The introduction here shows that the difficulty of the neighbors and other friends had already been raised, and something more than a desire on their part for religious guidance actuated their appeal to the Pharisees. Why should the healed man be taken to the Pharisees, or the synagogue-court at all, unless some question of casuistry had been raised? The movement was one unquestionably adverse to Jesus. It could have had no other motive. Nor can any doubt arise that Jesus had violated the rabbinical rules of the sabbath, though his act had been in perfect harmony with the spirit and even letter of the Mosaic Law. The making of clay with the spittle and the sand was an infringement of the rule ('Shabbath,' 24:3). It was curiously laid down in one of the vexatious interpretations (preserved in Jerusalem Gemara on 'Shabbath,' 14) that while "<span class="accented">wine</span> could by way of remedy be applied to the eyelid, on the ground that this might be treated as washing, it was sinful to apply it to the inside of the eye" (Edersheim). And it was positively forbidden (in the same Gemara) to apply saliva to the eyelid, because this would be the application of a remedy. All medicinal appliances, unless in cases of danger to life or limb, were likewise forbidden. Consequently, the Lord had broken with the traditional glosses on the Law in more ways than one (see Winer, 'Bibl. Realw.,' 2:346; Lightfoot, ' Ad Joan. 9; 'Wetstein on <a href="/matthew/12-9.htm">Matthew 12:9</a>; Wunsche, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] day</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#941;&#961;&#8115;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;mera)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2250.htm">Strong's 2250: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day, the period from sunrise to sunset. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
