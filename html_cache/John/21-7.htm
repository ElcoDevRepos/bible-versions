This phrase highlights the close relationship between John and Jesus, emphasizing John's insight and spiritual perception. In the context of the resurrection appearances, John's recognition of Jesus signifies a deep spiritual awareness. This moment occurs after a miraculous catch of fish, reminiscent of a similar event in <a href="/luke/5.htm">Luke 5:1-11</a>, reinforcing the divine nature of Jesus' actions and presence.<p><b>&#8220;It is the Lord!&#8221;</b><br>John's declaration, "It is the Lord," is a recognition of Jesus' identity and authority. This acknowledgment is significant as it confirms the resurrection and the fulfillment of Jesus' promises. The use of "Lord" underscores Jesus' divine status, aligning with Old Testament references to God as Lord (e.g., <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). This moment is a revelation to the disciples, affirming their faith and understanding of Jesus' mission.<p><b>As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,</b><br>Peter's immediate reaction upon hearing John's words reflects his impulsive and passionate nature, often depicted in the Gospels. This eagerness to be near Jesus is consistent with Peter's character, as seen in <a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28-29</a> when he walks on water towards Jesus. Peter's actions demonstrate his deep love and devotion, despite his previous denial of Christ.<p><b>he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it)</b><br>The mention of Peter's outer garment indicates the cultural practice of fishermen working with minimal clothing for ease and comfort. The act of putting on his garment before approaching Jesus shows respect and readiness to meet the Lord. This detail also highlights the authenticity of the narrative, providing insight into the daily life and customs of first-century fishermen.<p><b>and jumped into the sea.</b><br>Peter's decision to jump into the sea illustrates his urgency and desire to reach Jesus as quickly as possible. This act of jumping into the water can be seen as symbolic of baptism, representing purification and a renewed commitment to Christ. It also reflects Peter's boldness and willingness to act on his faith, a trait that would later define his leadership in the early Church, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14-41</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciple_whom_jesus_loved.htm">The Disciple Whom Jesus Loved</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be John, the author of the Gospel.

The traits of character which have before met us are exactly preserved here. John, true to the life of contemplation, is first to trace in the present draught of fishes an analogy with the earlier one, and to discern that the Master who spoke then is present now. Peter, true to the life of action, is first to rush into that Master's presence when he is told that it is the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">He girt his fisher's coat unto him (for he was naked).</span>--That is, as the words in the original clearly imply, he put on, and girded round his body the garment which workmen customarily used. This seems to have been a kind of linen frock worn over the shirt, and the Talmud has adopted the Greek word here used to express it. The word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and the rendering "fisher's coat" probably gives a correct idea of what is meant.<p>The common usage of the Greek and Hebrew words answering to the English word "naked," makes it probable that St. Peter was wearing some under-garment, and that reverence for the Lord, into whose presence he is about to go, led him to add to this the outer frock. (Comp. <a href="/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>, as a distinct consequence of the vivid reminiscence of the past; with sudden intuition given to him by the event, and a fresh realization of the identity of the risen Lord with the Master Jesus, <span class="cmt_word">that disciple therefore whom Jesus loved</span> - who must have been either one of the sons of Zebedee or one of the two unnamed disciples. The latter supposition is inapposite from the intimacy between Peter and John, which the synoptic narrative, and references in the Acts and Galatians it., have recorded; that disciple and no other, the one so often referred to, one of the seven, <span class="cmt_word">saith unto Peter, It is the Lord</span>. Had he not again and again done wondrous things of power, wisdom, and love on this very spot, in these very waters? So John comes intuitively and with true insight to the sacred truth and reality, and his conduct is again contrasted wonderfully with the energetic and impulsive Peter (<a href="/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5, 6</a>). The same relative characteristics of the two apostles have been preserved throughout the fivefold narrative. Such a contrast so delicately and persistently sustained lends certainty to the objective reality. <span class="cmt_word">Accordingly Simon Peter, when he heard, It is the Lord</span> - for the words flashed conviction into him - hurried at once to put his new idea to practical proof. The word of John satisfied him, and, not seeing for himself what John saw with mental eye, he accepted the joyful news, and was the first to spring into the sea, and, with his usual energy, to cast himself at his Master's feet. <span class="cmt_word">He girt his coat about him</span> (<span class="cmt_word">for he was naked</span>). The word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> does not mean perfectly nude. A man who had simply the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> or tunic upon him was practically thus regarded. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>; <a href="/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> in the same sense. The proper name for the tunic, or garment next the skin, was <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and that which was put over the tunic was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (Meyer and Wettstein, in loc.). The Talmud has Aramaized the word, calling it <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span> (ependetha), and used it for the workman's frock or blouse, often without sleeves, and fastened with a girdle. Dr. Salmond truly says that this reference to an act which to ordinary men would have suggested a different arrangement of dress, reveals the eye-witness. Hengstenberg suggests that Peter simply girded his upper garment for the purpose of swimming more easily; but, as Luthardt observes, with this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> already upon him, he would not have been "naked" <span class="cmt_word">And he cast himself into the sea</span>, intending, whatever might be the fate of the laden net, to be the first to greet and worship the Lord. Of the reception he met with John says nothing: he knew nothing. The Lord had some special instruction for him a little later. It is not in harmony with the words, as Gerhard supposed, that Peter walked triumphantly upon the waters. Not a hint of it occurs. The hundred yards were rapidly covered, either by swimming or wading to the shore meanwhile. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
