The love mentioned here is foundational to the Trinity, reflecting a perfect and eternal bond. This love is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, where God declares His pleasure in His Son. Theologically, this love underscores the unity and co-equality of the Father and the Son, which is central to understanding the nature of God in Christian doctrine.<p><b>and shows Him all He does.</b><br>This indicates the complete transparency and shared purpose between the Father and the Son. In the context of Jesus' ministry, it suggests that Jesus' actions and teachings are direct reflections of the Father's will. This aligns with <a href="/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>, where Jesus states that the words He speaks are not His own but the Father's. The phrase also implies the Son's divine insight and authority, as He is privy to the Father's works, which are hidden from others.<p><b>And to your amazement,</b><br>Here, Jesus addresses His audience, likely the Jewish leaders and bystanders, indicating that what they will witness will surpass their expectations. This phrase sets the stage for the unfolding of miraculous events and teachings that challenge their understanding and beliefs. The amazement is not just at the miracles themselves but at the revelation of Jesus' divine identity and mission.<p><b>He will show Him even greater works than these.</b><br>This points to the future acts of Jesus that will reveal His divine authority and power more fully. The "greater works" can be understood as the miracles that follow, such as the raising of Lazarus (John 11) and ultimately, Jesus' own resurrection. These works serve as signs pointing to Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. Theologically, this phrase also foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, culminating in His death and resurrection, which are the greatest works of salvation history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, who is in a loving relationship with the Son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, who is the recipient of the Father's love and revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/greater_works.htm">Greater Works</a></b><br>Refers to the miraculous works and teachings of Jesus that reveal His divine authority and mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, who are often skeptical of His claims and works.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The location where this discourse takes place, a central place of Jewish worship and teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_divine_relationship.htm">The Divine Relationship</a></b><br>The love between the Father and the Son is foundational to understanding the Trinity.

God is His Father. There is, therefore, oneness of essence. The unity of His work with God's work has for its basis the Eternal Love, which showeth to the Son all that the Father doeth. As the relation of Son implies moral inability to do anything apart from the Father, so the relation of Father implies moral necessity to impart all to the Son.<p><span class= "bld">Greater works than these.</span>--The works which He had done could only be explained by the unity of His work with that of the Father; but in the development of His own human nature and His mediatorial work, there will be shown to Him, and He will show to man by doing them in their midst, works of which these are but as the first signs. The "ye" is emphatic, and the word "marvel" should also be noticed. "Ye who seek to kill Me shall yourselves see works which, against your will, shall be wonders to you; but against your will they cannot be signs. Ye will marvel, but ye will not believe!"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> - the Lord introduces a reason, states a fact, which is calculated to make this vision of the Father's activity apprehensible to his hearers - <span class="cmt_word">the Father loveth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> expresses strong personal, natural affection, <span class="accented">amat</span> rather than the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="accented">diligit</span> of many other passages.

"O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee." So stupendous a claim was never exceeded or transcended. "All things that himself doeth," shown and visible to One walking this world. The mind either rebels against or succumbs before such sublime and all-embracing knowledge. No neutrality is possible. If these were his words, then there is justification for the generalizations of the prologue. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20b-29.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">The greater works.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And greater works than these works of healing will he show him.</span> Here the term <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span> is used for the first time in this Gospel. It becomes the recognized phrase by which Christ describes what the world regards as "signs and wonders," "miracles" of power or grace; but it actually connotes the simple activity of God, the normal operation of his hand. Greater manifestations than physical quickening or revival namely, the mighty changes of thought and life, the gifts of grace and peace, eternal life itself, are evermore proceeding. The Father will so show them that the Son will see and do them, and so bring them by revelation to your consciousness <span class="cmt_word">that ye may marvel</span>. Christ will not say here that ye may believe, but that ye may look on confounded and astonished. This was the first effect of Christ's work - Christ's revelation of the Father's heart, Christ's demonstration of the Father's nearness and character. Westcott quotes the apocryphal saying of our Lord preserved by Clement of Alexandria, 'Str.,' 2:9. 45, "He that wonders shall reign, and he that reigns shall rest." The wonders of grace will never be exhausted. New combinations, new transformations, new discoveries, new insight into the eternal love, will be effected by him whom God hath sent, whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world (but see ver. 28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
