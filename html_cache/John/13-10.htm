This setting is significant as it is the night before Jesus' crucifixion, a time filled with profound teachings and symbolic acts. Jesus' words here are part of a larger discourse on servanthood and humility, as He has just washed the disciples' feet, a task typically reserved for the lowest servant.<p><b>&#8220;Whoever has already bathed</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, bathing was a common practice before attending a meal, especially a significant one like the Passover. This phrase suggests a state of initial cleansing, which can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual cleansing that comes through faith in Jesus. The act of bathing symbolizes the comprehensive purification that believers receive when they accept Christ.<p><b>needs only to wash his feet,</b><br>In the dusty roads of ancient Israel, feet would become dirty quickly, even after a full bath. Washing feet was a practical necessity and a cultural norm. Spiritually, this act represents the ongoing need for believers to seek forgiveness and purification from daily sins, even after their initial salvation. It highlights the importance of continual repentance and sanctification in the Christian life.<p><b>and he will be completely clean.</b><br>This assurance of complete cleanliness points to the sufficiency of Jesus' sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. It emphasizes that once a person is cleansed by Christ, they are fully justified before God. The completeness of this cleansing is a central tenet of Christian doctrine, affirming the believer's secure position in Christ.<p><b>And you are clean,</b><br>Here, Jesus affirms the spiritual state of His disciples, indicating that they have been cleansed through their faith in Him. This statement reassures them of their standing before God, despite their imperfections and the challenges they will face. It underscores the transformative power of faith and the grace that covers believers.<p><b>though not all of you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase introduces a note of caution and foreshadows the betrayal by Judas Iscariot. Despite being part of the group and participating in the same rituals, Judas' heart was not aligned with Jesus. This serves as a warning about the dangers of hypocrisy and the importance of genuine faith. It also fulfills the prophecy of betrayal found in the Old Testament, highlighting the sovereignty of God in the unfolding of redemptive history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples a lesson in humility and spiritual cleansing during the Last Supper.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' disciples, Peter initially resists Jesus washing his feet, demonstrating a misunderstanding of Jesus' symbolic act.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' followers present at the Last Supper, witnessing and participating in this significant teaching moment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The setting of this event, where Jesus shares a final meal with His disciples before His crucifixion, instituting the practice of communion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Judas is implied in the phrase "though not all of you," indicating his impending betrayal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_cleansing.htm">Spiritual Cleansing</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the need for spiritual cleansing, symbolized by the washing of feet.

A believer receives a once-for-all bath at salvation, leaving him positionally clean forever. Yet life&#8217;s daily dust calls for repeated &#8220;foot-washing&#8221; through confession and surrender, keeping fellowship fresh. Jesus&#8217; words comfort the true disciple with assurance while warning the pretender that no ritual can substitute for genuine faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">He who has bathed</span> . . . St. Peter's words have implied that he was wholly unclean, and needed for feet, and head, and hands, for the whole man, a moral cleansing. Christ answers that this was not so. The man who has been bathed is clean, but his feet coming in contact with the dust of the road need to be washed. It was so morally. They had been cleansed; their whole moral life had been changed, but they were liable to the corruption of every-day life through which they walked, and needed to be cleansed from the pollution of it. That day had furnished an example; their pride and self-seeking was of the spirit of the world, and not of the spirit of Christ; His act was a cleansing from that, but it did not imply that they were not clean. The lesson is that all, from Apostles downwards, need the daily renewing of the grace of God; and that none should find in failure, or even in the evil which clings to his daily path, reason for questioning the reality of the moral change which has made him the child of God.<p><span class= "bld">And ye are clean, but not all.</span>--This is the moral application, accompanied by the mournful thought that it was not true of all. One there was among those who had been bathed who had allowed evil to enter into his heart and pollute it. For him cleansing had been neglected, and the daily corruption of the world had remained; evil thoughts had been harboured, until at length they had made corrupt the whole man. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/15-4.htm" title="Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me.">John 15:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith to him</span>. Christ's answer here undoubtedly shows that he is speaking of something far more important than the foot-washing. He goes back to the spiritual meaning which Peter attributed to his words. <span class="cmt_word">He that has been bathed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is indeed washed from head to foot, <span class="cmt_word">hath no further need than to wash his feet</span>, <span class="cmt_word">but is altogether clean.</span> By personal communion with the Lord and belief in him, by the word which he had spoken to his disciples, they were (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) clean (<a href="/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>). They had been washed from the defilement of their old nature, they had undergone a thorough moral and spiritual change, by moral union with Christ. They were reconciled and cleansed; they therefore did not need a fundamental change to be wrought daily in head, hands, and life. Just as a man who had thoroughly bathed only requires the removal of the soil contracted in the daily walk; so a regenerated and forgiven man is clean, and, like Peter, should not need, being <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, more than the foot-cleansing which Christ in Divine condescension had then granted. It was inevitable that some of the Fathers (Augustine, Theodore) and many modern expositors (Hengstenberg, Godet, and Wordsworth) should see here a reference to baptism, and speak of Peter's having overlooked the grace of his baptism. When it is remembered, however, that nothing but John's "baptism unto repentance" had been administered to the disciples, and that this cleansing is, in <a href="/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>, distinctly referred to the <span class="accented">word</span> of Christ, it is a very unnecessary trifling with the text to find in this <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> baptism or any sacramental or symbolic act. Lampe and Cocceius, in rendering <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, substitute for baptism, the regeneration of the Spirit, and treat the washing of the feet as equivalent to the daily forgiveness of sins of infirmity. Archdeacon Farrar, 'Early Days of Christianity,' vol. 1. p. 126, suggests that this intensely interesting scene may account for Simon Peter's picturesque expression (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), wherein he enjoins on Christians to "tie on humility like a dress fastened with knots;" and also for the apostle's "insight into the true meaning of baptism, as being, not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God." <span class="cmt_word">And ye are clean</span>; and therefore these words and this principle apply to you. Dr. Westcott finds in this phrase a reference to the purity of the <span class="accented">visible</span> Church, notwithstanding, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the presence of Judas in the group; but the exception itself which follows shows that the Lord did not regard Judas as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The suggestion of the passage is precisely contrary to that so often drawn. <span class="cmt_word">But not all</span>. This reference to Judas may have been one more warning to the man who was plotting against his Master's life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">him,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
