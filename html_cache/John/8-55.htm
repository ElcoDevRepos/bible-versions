Despite their extensive knowledge of the Scriptures, they failed to recognize God in the person of Jesus Christ. This echoes the theme found in <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where God laments that His people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. The religious leaders' failure to know God is not due to a lack of information but a lack of relationship and spiritual insight.<p><b>but I know Him</b><br>Jesus asserts His unique and intimate knowledge of the Father, emphasizing His divine nature and pre-existence. This claim is consistent with <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word who was with God and was God. His knowledge of the Father is not merely intellectual but relational, reflecting the unity and oneness within the Trinity. This statement also fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah having a special relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>.<p><b>If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like you</b><br>Here, Jesus contrasts His truthfulness with the dishonesty of the religious leaders. By accusing them of being liars, He points to their hypocrisy and failure to live according to the truth they claim to uphold. This echoes the condemnation of false prophets and leaders in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>. Jesus' unwavering commitment to truth is a hallmark of His ministry and character, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where He declares Himself to be the way, the truth, and the life.<p><b>But I do know Him</b><br>Reiterating His intimate knowledge of the Father, Jesus emphasizes His authority and credibility. This statement underscores the divine revelation and mission of Jesus, as He is the only one who can truly reveal the Father to humanity. This is further supported by <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>, where Jesus states that no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.<p><b>and I keep His word</b><br>Jesus' obedience to the Father is a central theme in His ministry, demonstrating His role as the perfect servant and Son. This obedience fulfills the messianic prophecies of a faithful servant, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>. Jesus' commitment to keeping the Father's word serves as a model for believers, highlighting the importance of obedience and faithfulness in the Christian life. This is further emphasized in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to keep His commandments as an expression of love for Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, asserting His intimate knowledge of God the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time, often in opposition to Jesus, questioning His authority and knowledge of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>Referred to by Jesus as the one whom He knows intimately and whose word He keeps.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, a city central to Jewish religious life and the location of many of Jesus' teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/john/8.htm">John 8</a>, during which Jesus was teaching in the temple courts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/intimate_knowledge_of_god.htm">Intimate Knowledge of God</a></b><br>Jesus claims a unique and intimate knowledge of God, which is foundational to His authority and teaching.

The two verbs "know" and "known" here do not represent the same Greek word.

Again the positive statement is made in the certainty of His full knowledge, and this is followed by a statement of the observance of the same condition of communion with the Father which He had made necessary for communion of the disciples with Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> while you thus speak, and though you call him your God; cf. a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, very nearly expressed, but not exactly, by the "yet" of the Authorized Version) <span class="cmt_word">ye have not come to know him</span> by all the experiences through which you have passed (cf. <a href="/john/7-29.htm">John 7:29</a>; <a href="/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>; and ver. 19). You do not know the only true God, you have not the knowledge which is life eternal. <span class="cmt_word">But I know him,</span> absolutely, intuitively, by the open eye of clearest consciousness, with invincible and perfect assent. The use and contrast of the two verbs <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, here and elsewhere, is very striking (see <a href="/john/3-10.htm">John 3:10</a>; <a href="/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>). When our Lord, however, was broadly contrasting the Jewish knowledge of God with that of the Samaritans, and identifying himself with the Jews (<a href="/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>), he uses <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">If I</span> <span class="cmt_word">should say that I know him not</span> - which I do not and dare not say. Christ could not admit that his absolute knowledge was a delusion. The reality of the Father in his Divine-human consciousness, expressing itself through his human thought and word, was supreme, overmastering, sublime - <span class="cmt_word">I shall be, like you, a liar;</span> I should deceive you wilfully, as you are deceiving yourselves. We cannot fail here again to observe the severity of Jesus as portrayed in this Gospel. (There is nothing surely here, or in other numerous utterances in this discourse, inconsistent with the Son of Thunder.) No cowardly modesty (Lange) is possible to him. He knows, and must speak. He cannot, dare not, be silent, or allow these bitter enemies, with their ready malice and perverse and continuous misinterpretation of his words, to be ignorant, either of the ground of his self-consciousness or his penetration of their flimsy excuses. So once more he adds, <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">I know him, and keep</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his word.</span> He will not allow this Divine consciousness to be taken from him, even by the shame and agony of the cross (Lange). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-55.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You do not know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#957;&#974;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(egn&#333;kate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
