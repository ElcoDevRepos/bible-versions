It served as a public declaration of the crime for which the person was being executed. In the case of Jesus, this notice was written by Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, who found no fault in Jesus but succumbed to the pressure of the Jewish leaders and the crowd. The act of posting the notice underscores the legal and political dynamics at play during the crucifixion. It also fulfills the Roman legal requirement to publicly display the reason for execution, which in this case was a claim to kingship.<p><b>It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH,</b><br>The mention of "Nazareth" identifies Jesus with His hometown, a small and seemingly insignificant village in Galilee. This detail emphasizes Jesus' humble origins, which were often a point of contention and skepticism among His contemporaries (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>). The reference to Nazareth also fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>), highlighting the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in the life of Jesus.<p><b>THE KING OF THE JEWS.</b><br>This title is both a declaration and an accusation. It was intended by Pilate to mock the Jewish leaders and to signify the charge of treason against Rome, as claiming to be a king was seen as a direct challenge to Caesar's authority. However, from a theological perspective, this title is profoundly significant. It acknowledges Jesus' true identity as the Messiah and King prophesied in the Hebrew Scriptures (e.g., <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>). The title "King of the Jews" connects to the Davidic Covenant, where God promised that David's throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). Jesus, as a descendant of David, fulfills this promise, and His kingship is affirmed in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). The irony of the inscription is that while it was meant to be a charge, it proclaimed a profound truth about Jesus' divine kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor who presided over the trial of Jesus and authorized His crucifixion.

St. John speaks of the <span class= "ital">title</span> placed over the cross. This was the common Roman name for an inscription of the kind, which was meant to give information of the crime for which the sentence of crucifixion had been given. St. Matthew calls it the "accusation;" St. Mark, "the superscription of the accusation;" St. Luke, "the superscription." (Comp. <a href="/luke/23-38.htm" title="And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Luke 23:38</a>.) The inscription varies in word, though not in sense, in each of the narratives; <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Evangelists, in dealing with a written inscription, in which there could have been neither doubt nor difficulty, have not been careful to give us the exact words. The fact is significant, as bearing upon the literary characteristics of the Gospels, and upon the value which the writers set upon exact accuracy in unimportant details. The reason of the variations may, of course, be traced to the fact that one or more of the accounts may be a translation from the Hebrew inscription.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-22.</span> - (b) The title on the cross <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The evangelist turns to an event of which the synoptists say little, and quietly attribute to the Jews themselves. John, from the special access which he had to information about the high priest and the court of Pilate, says, <span class="cmt_word">Now Pilate wrote a title also</span> (the Latin technical word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used in preference to the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, "superscription"), <span class="cmt_word">and he put it,</span> by the hands of his own soldiers, <span class="cmt_word">on the cross.</span> We cannot translate <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> as a pluperfect, and therefore it becomes probable that after the procession had gone howling and cursing away to Golgotha, he had had the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, prepared. <span class="cmt_word">And there was written</span> upon the parchment, or the tablet, in letters all could read, <span class="cmt_word">JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS</span>, thus Pilate resolved to sting these murderous Jews to the last point of exasperation, in harmony with the character given him by Philo-Judaeus; but perhaps this motive was also stimulated by another - though he sought to punish their pride with scorn and scoff at their hypocritical charge, he may have had some strange irresistible conviction that there was reality in the royal supremacy of this marvelous Being, who throughout was conspicuously triumphant in his patient dignity. He seems muttering to himself, "Let him be Chief of malefactors, but he is and will be King of the Jews nevertheless, and I do not ignore the memories of either David or Solomon, Zerubbabel, Hyrcanus, or Idumaean Herod." The title differs slightly in its phrase in the four evangelists, yet they all preserve literatim the central fact of the change, "the King of the Jews." John alone mentions the circumstance, which may explain the minute differences (so Gresswell, 'Diss.,' 42.), viz. that it was written in three languages, <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the vernacular, or "Hebrew;" <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the official, or "Latin;" <p><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the speech generally understood by all strangers, or "Greek."  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Pilate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#953;&#955;&#8118;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pilatos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4091.htm">Strong's 4091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pilate.
