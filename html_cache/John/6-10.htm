In the context of a large crowd, organization was necessary for the miracle that was about to occur. This act of sitting down can be seen as a preparation for receiving, similar to how believers are called to be ready to receive God's blessings. The command also reflects the shepherd-like nature of Jesus, as a shepherd makes his flock lie down in green pastures (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>). This phrase also highlights Jesus' role as a teacher and leader, providing for the needs of His followers.<p><b>Now there was plenty of grass in that place,</b><br>The mention of grass indicates the time of year, likely spring, as grass would be abundant. This detail aligns with the Passover season mentioned earlier in <a href="/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>. The presence of grass also provides a practical setting for the crowd to sit comfortably, emphasizing God's provision in both spiritual and physical needs. The green grass can be seen as a symbol of life and abundance, reflecting the new life Jesus offers.<p><b>so the men sat down,</b><br>The act of sitting down signifies readiness and expectation. In Jewish culture, sitting was a common posture for learning and receiving instruction, indicating that the crowd was prepared to receive what Jesus was about to provide. This also reflects a sense of community and unity among the people, as they collectively obeyed Jesus' instruction.<p><b>about five thousand of them.</b><br>The number five thousand refers specifically to men, as was customary in ancient counting, which means the total number of people, including women and children, could have been much larger. This large number highlights the magnitude of the miracle that follows, demonstrating Jesus' divine power to provide abundantly. The feeding of the five thousand is one of the few miracles recorded in all four Gospels, underscoring its significance. This event foreshadows the spiritual nourishment Jesus provides, as He later declares Himself the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is about to perform the miracle of feeding the five thousand.
