Caiaphas, the high priest, had already condemned Jesus, but the Jewish leaders lacked the authority to execute Him, necessitating Roman involvement. The Praetorium was the official residence of the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, in Jerusalem. This location underscores the political tension between Roman authority and Jewish leadership. The movement from Caiaphas to the Praetorium signifies the shift from religious to political judgment, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy about being handed over to the Gentiles (<a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>).<p><b>By now it was early morning,</b><br>The timing indicates the urgency and determination of the Jewish leaders to have Jesus executed before the Passover festivities. The early morning hours suggest a hasty and possibly irregular legal process, as trials were not typically conducted at this time. This timing also aligns with the Jewish day beginning at sunset, emphasizing the rapid sequence of events following Jesus' arrest.<p><b>and the Jews did not enter the Praetorium,</b><br>The Jewish leaders avoided entering the Praetorium to maintain ceremonial purity. Entering a Gentile's residence could render them unclean according to Jewish law, particularly during the Passover. This highlights the irony of their concern for ritual purity while plotting the death of an innocent man. Their actions reflect a legalistic adherence to the law, contrasting with the moral and spiritual corruption in their hearts.<p><b>to avoid being defiled and unable to eat the Passover.</b><br>The Passover was a significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt. Being defiled would prevent participation in the Passover meal, a central religious observance. This concern for ritual purity underscores the leaders' hypocrisy, as they prioritize ceremonial law over justice and mercy. The Passover context also foreshadows Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice would bring true deliverance from sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being led to the Praetorium for trial.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/caiaphas.htm">Caiaphas</a></b><br>The high priest who played a significant role in the trial and condemnation of Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_praetorium.htm">The Praetorium</a></b><br>The Roman governor's headquarters in Jerusalem, where Jesus was taken for trial before Pontius Pilate.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Those who led Jesus to the Praetorium, concerned with ceremonial purity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passover.htm">The Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, highlighting the leaders' concern for ritual purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrisy_of_religious_leaders.htm">Hypocrisy of Religious Leaders</a></b><br>The Jewish leaders were more concerned with ceremonial purity than with justice and truth.

The word is used primarily for the general's tent in the Roman camps, and for the legal residence of the chief of a province. Now, the ordinary residence of the Roman governors was at Caesarea, but at the time of the great feasts they were in the habit of going up to Jerusalem, and at a later time than this (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:14. 8; 15:5) the governors utilized for this purpose the former palace of Herod, a gorgeous residence in the upper city. It is, however, more probable that Pilate occupied the palace of the Castle of Antonia, overlooking the northwest corner of the temple area, and having means of direct communication with it. Edersheim inclines to the palace of Herod. From the high-priestly palace to the castle they led Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">And it was early.</span> [In <a href="/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a> and <a href="/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x1fd6;&#x1ffd;</span> is equivalent to the fourth watch of the night, between three and six o'clock. The breadth of the phrase would cover the period of the hurried council (see <a href="/matthew/27.htm">Matthew 27</a>; <a href="/mark/15.htm">Mark 15</a>.) and the session of Pilate. The Roman judgments were often conducted in early morning (Seneca, 'De Ira,' 2:7) <span class="accented">- prima luce</span>.] The council having in their indecent haste conveyed Jesus to the Praetorium, while (<span class="cmt_word">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">they themselves went not into the Praetorium,</span> <span class="cmt_word">lest they should be defiled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, the solemn word for "profane" in Plato, Sophocles, and the LXX.). This defilement by entrance into the house of a Gentile was not an enactment of the Law, but was a purely rabbinic observance (Delitzsch, 'Talmudische Studien,' 14. (1874); 'Zeitschrift fur die gesammte Luth. Theol.'). We find it operative in <a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>, and thus a hint given not merely of the author's knowledge of the inner life of Judaism, but of his quiet recognition of the stupendous spectacle of malicious ritualism, and of unscrupulous antagonism to the Holiest One, busying itself about attention to the letter of that which was only a rabbinic legislation. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">might eat the Passover</span>. Here in this passage we come once more face to face with the persistent puzzle occasioned by the divergent intimations of John and the synoptists as to the day of our Lord's death. In <a href="/matthew/26-17.htm">Matthew 26:17</a> and <a href="/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12-14</a> this very phrase is used for the preparation of that Paschal supper which our Lord celebrated with his disciples (see Introduction, pp. 93, etc.). So that we have at any rate a discordant verbal usage, however the problem be solved. The day is breaking, which constitutes, according to John (<span class="accented">prima facie</span>), the 14th of Nisan, in the evening of which and commencement of the 15th the Passover would be killed. According to the synoptists, that Passover meal was already over, and the first great day of the feast had commenced - the day of convocation, with sabbatic functions and duties. The statements are apparently in hopeless variance. Many emphasize, exaggerate, and declare insoluble the contradiction, repudiating either the authority of John or that of the synoptists. Meyer and Lucke give their verdict with John, the eye-witness, as against the synoptic tradition. Strauss and Keim, who also hold the invincible discrepancy, lift the synoptic account to a comparatively high state of historic validity, and thereby discredit the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel. We have two methods of reconciling the difficulty: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> An endeavor to show that the synoptic narrative itself is inconsistent with the idea that the night of the Passion was the night of the general Passover. <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> That the entire proceeding of the trial was inconsistent with the feast-day;  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
