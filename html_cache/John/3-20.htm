In biblical context, "evil" is often associated with actions that are contrary to God's nature and will. The concept of evil is rooted in the fall of man (Genesis 3), where sin entered the world through Adam and Eve's disobedience. Throughout Scripture, evil is depicted as a force that corrupts and separates humanity from God (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p><b>hates the Light</b><br>The "Light" symbolizes Jesus Christ, who is described as the "Light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). In the prologue of John's Gospel, Jesus is introduced as the true Light that gives light to everyone (<a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). The hatred of the Light by those who do evil reflects the spiritual conflict between darkness and light, a theme prevalent in John's writings. This enmity is rooted in the natural human inclination to resist divine truth and righteousness (<a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>).<p><b>and does not come into the Light</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate choice to avoid exposure to the truth and holiness of Christ. The refusal to come into the Light is a rejection of the opportunity for repentance and transformation. In the cultural context of the time, light was associated with knowledge, purity, and divine presence, while darkness symbolized ignorance and sin. The reluctance to approach the Light underscores the human tendency to hide from God, as seen in Adam and Eve's response to their sin (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>).<p><b>for fear that his deeds will be exposed</b><br>The fear of exposure highlights the convicting power of the Light, which reveals the true nature of one's actions and intentions. This fear is rooted in the awareness of guilt and the potential for judgment. The concept of exposure is linked to the idea of divine judgment, where all hidden things will be brought to light (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>).

Yet the same Light that exposes also offers cleansing and life (<a href="/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>). Choosing Light over darkness is the only path from hidden shame to forgiven freedom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light.</span>--In this and the next verse we have the explanation of the choice of the darkness and rejection of the light. The fact itself is first stated more strongly. Not only does the man that doeth evil love darkness rather than light, but he hates the light. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/7-7.htm" title="The world cannot hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.">John 7:7</a>.) Its presence makes manifest and reproves his works, which he would hide even from himself. It illumines the dark and secret chambers of the heart, and reveals thoughts and deeds which conscience, seeing in this light, trembles at, and turns away to darkness that it may hide itself from its own gaze.<p>It has been often noted that the word "doeth," in this and the following verse, represent different words in the original. Perhaps we may distinguish them in English by rendering this verse: "Every one that <span class= "ital">practiseth</span> evil." It is not less important to note that the word for evil here differs from the word so rendered' in the last clause of the previous verse. Strictly, and the change of word seems to demand a strict interpretation (comp. Note on <a href="/john/5-29.htm" title="And shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.">John 5:29</a>), it is not that which is positively, but that which is negatively, evil--that which is trivial, poor, worthless. The man who practiseth such things misses the aim of life, and turns from the light that would point it out to him. He does many things, but forgets that one thing is needful, and spends a life-time in trifles without any permanent result. We are familiar with the thought that immorality shuns the light and warps the will, and thus darkens knowledge and weakens faith; but we remember too seldom the deadening effect of an unreal and aimless existence which is not truly a life.<p><span class= "bld">Should be reproved.</span>--The margin will show that our translators felt a difficulty about this word (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>), where it is rendered "tell him his fault," and comp. the other instances in this Gospel, <a href="/john/8-9.htm" title="And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.">John 8:9</a>; <a href="/john/8-46.htm" title="Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?">John 8:46</a> ("convince" in both), and especially <a href="/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a> ("reprove," and margin "convince"). The moral idea is exactly illustrated by the action of light, which makes manifest the wrong, and leads the conscience to see it and repent of it. It is through this chastening that the man passes from darkness to light. It is because men shrink from this chastening that they hate the light. (Comp. Notes on the remarkable parallel in <a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm" title="And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.">Ephesians 5:11</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - This verse expounds and supplies a further and causal explanation of the relation of conduct to character. <span class="cmt_word">For every one that praetiseth bad things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> are contrasted, not only here, but in <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>; <a href="/romans/2-3.htm">Romans 2:3</a>; <a href="/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15, 19, 20</a>. See Trench's 'Syn. N.T.,' p. 340). The first suggests the repeated acts of a man's conduct, his habits, his practice, and not unfrequently it has a bad sense attributed to it, while the second, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, refers to the full expression of an inward life, and is more appropriate to denote the higher deeds and grander principles). This practice of bad ways (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) leads infallibly, by the just judgment of God, <span class="cmt_word">to</span> a hatred of that which will reveal and confound the transgressor. <span class="cmt_word">Every one,</span> etc., <span class="cmt_word">hateth the light</span> (this shows that we cannot err in giving to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 19 the sense of <span class="accented">potius</span>), and the hardening process which is a judgment of God upon man, ever going on, becomes more conspicuous in this, that <span class="cmt_word">he cometh not to the light, in order that his</span> <span class="cmt_word">works may not be convicted;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lest his works should be revealed - shown to him and to others in their true light. The night time, during which so many evil things, base things, unclean things, are practised, was darkening down over Jerusalem when our Lord was speaking, and would give fateful emphasis to these solemn words. This love of darkness proceeded from a hatred of the revealing power of the light. This rejection of the only begotten Son of God proceeded from a long habit of sin, showing more emphatically than before the need of radical spiritual regeneration - a birth of water and of the Spirit. The rejection of the Christ's claim to cleanse the temple - a fact of which Nicodemus, as Sanhedrist, must have been fully aware - was a striking illustration of his great argument. The "dread of the light is both moral pride and moral effeminacy" (Meyer).
