The Holy Spirit's role is significant in the New Testament, acting as a comforter, guide, and source of power for believers. Jesus frequently spoke about the coming of the Holy Spirit, particularly in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17, 26</a>; 16:7-15). The Spirit's work is to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment, and to guide believers into all truth.<p><b>whom those who believed in Him were later to receive</b><br>This phrase indicates a future event for the disciples and early believers. The reception of the Holy Spirit is a promise fulfilled at Pentecost, as recorded in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. This event marked the beginning of the Church and the empowerment of believers to spread the Gospel. The Holy Spirit's indwelling presence is a distinctive feature of the New Covenant, contrasting with the Old Testament, where the Spirit came upon individuals temporarily for specific tasks.<p><b>For the Spirit had not yet been given</b><br>At this point in Jesus' ministry, the Holy Spirit had not been given in the way that would occur after Jesus' ascension. In the Old Testament, the Spirit's presence was selective and temporary, but the New Testament promises a permanent indwelling for all believers. This giving of the Spirit is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, which speaks of God pouring out His Spirit on all people.<p><b>because Jesus had not yet been glorified</b><br>The glorification of Jesus refers to His death, resurrection, and ascension. It is through these events that Jesus completed His work of salvation, making it possible for the Holy Spirit to be given to believers. Jesus' glorification is a central theme in the Gospel of John, where His crucifixion is paradoxically seen as the moment of His exaltation (<a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23-33</a>). The sending of the Spirit is contingent upon Jesus' return to the Father, as He explained in <a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, speaking about the future coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Referred to as the Spirit, who believers would receive after Jesus' glorification.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who have faith in Jesus and are promised the future reception of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/glorification_of_jesus.htm">Glorification of Jesus</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus' death, resurrection, and ascension, after which the Holy Spirit would be given.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>The context in which Jesus speaks these words, a Jewish festival celebrating God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_the_spirit.htm">The Promise of the Spirit</a></b><br>Jesus' words assure believers of the coming of the Holy Spirit, a promise fulfilled at Pentecost.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Spirit empowers, guides, and transforms believers, enabling them to live out their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_timing_of_the_spirit's_coming.htm">The Timing of the Spirit's Coming</a></b><br>The Spirit was given after Jesus' glorification, highlighting the importance of Jesus' death and resurrection in God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_by_the_spirit.htm">Living by the Spirit</a></b><br>Believers are called to live by the Spirit, producing spiritual fruit and reflecting Christ's character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_god's_presence.htm">The Assurance of God's Presence</a></b><br>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit assures believers of God's continual presence and guidance in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_7_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 7:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_7_39_When_does_Spirit_arrive.htm">How does John 7:39 explain the timing of the Holy Spirit's arrival?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_wasn_t_the_Spirit_given_yet_in_John_7_39.htm">Why was the Spirit not yet given according to John 7:39?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_7_39_to_Acts_2_4_Pentecost.htm">How does John 7:39 connect to Acts 2:4 and Pentecost?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/John_7_39_Jesus_glorification_meaning.htm">What does John 7:39 teach about Jesus' glorification and its significance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Experiencing_the_Spirit_today.htm">How can believers today experience the Spirit's presence as described in John 7:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_7_39_Holy_Spirit_s_role_pre-glory.htm">What does John 7:39 reveal about the Holy Spirit's role before Jesus' glorification?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_7_39_to_living_water.htm">How does John 7:39 connect to the concept of living water in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_wasn_t_Holy_Spirit_given_yet.htm">Why was the Holy Spirit not yet given according to John 7:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_was_the_robber_synod's_result.htm">What is the manifestation of the Spirit?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_is_god_invisible_if_he_wants_us.htm">If God wants a relationship with us, why does He remain invisible instead of revealing Himself physically?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_meaning_of_living_water.htm">What is the meaning of Living Water?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_water_of_life's_meaning.htm">What is the significance of the Water of Life?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 7:39 Mean</div><b>He was speaking about the Spirit</b><p>Jesus had just cried out, &#8220;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>). By immediately clarifying that He &#8220;was speaking about the Spirit,&#8221; John removes any doubt about the source of that living water.<p>&#8226; Earlier, Jesus told Nicodemus that believers must be &#8220;born of the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; He will later teach, &#8220;The Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in the Old Testament, the promise of God&#8217;s Spirit bringing refreshment is clear&#8212;&#8220;I will pour out My Spirit on all people&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>), a prophecy Peter later links to Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-16.htm">Acts 2:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>In every case, the Spirit is the divine Person who imparts the life Jesus offers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whom those who believed in Him were later to receive</b><p>The Spirit is not for a select spiritual elite; He is promised to &#8220;those who believed in Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; At Pentecost, every believer gathered in Jerusalem &#8220;was filled with the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>), exactly fulfilling this promise.<p>&#8226; Peter assures the crowd, &#8220;Repent and be baptized&#8230; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul echoes the same certainty: &#8220;Having believed, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>).<p>So the gift is both universal to all who believe and personal to each individual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the Spirit had not yet been given</b><p>John writes from the vantage point of years later, looking back on a unique moment in salvation history.<p>&#8226; Jesus warns the disciples, &#8220;Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Before His ascension He instructs them, &#8220;Stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a> records that they waited just as He commanded.<p>The delay was deliberate: God timed the outpouring of the Spirit to coincide with the completion of Christ&#8217;s redemptive work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because Jesus had not yet been glorified</b><p>&#8220;Glorified&#8221; points to Jesus&#8217; death, resurrection, and ascension&#8212;one unified event in God&#8217;s plan.<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself links His forthcoming death to glory: &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>).<p>&#8226; In His high-priestly prayer He says, &#8220;Father, glorify Me in Your presence with the glory I had with You before the world existed&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>).<p>&#8226; After the ascension, Peter explains that Jesus, &#8220;exalted to the right hand of God&#8230; has poured out what you now see and hear&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later declares that because He humbled Himself to death, &#8220;God exalted Him to the highest place&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-9</a>).<p>Christ&#8217;s glorification unlocks the Spirit&#8217;s full ministry to the church.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a> assures us that Jesus&#8217; promise of living water is the promise of the Holy Spirit. At the time Jesus spoke, the Spirit&#8217;s indwelling was still future, awaiting Christ&#8217;s completed work and exaltation. Once Jesus was glorified, every believer&#8212;beginning at Pentecost and continuing today&#8212;receives the Spirit as the abiding, life-giving presence of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) The word "given" is omitted in nearly all MSS. except the Vatican. "Holy" before Ghost is also probably an insertion, though it is found in some of the oldest MSS. and versions. These are additions of copyists who were anxious to preserve from all possibility of misinterpretation the doctrine concerning the Holy Spirit. This doctrine is more fully expounded in John 14-16, where see Notes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This spake he,</span> <span class="cmt_word">said the evangelist, concerning the Spirit, which they that believe</span> <span class="cmt_word">on</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span> <span class="cmt_word">were to receive: for the</span> (Holy) <span class="cmt_word">Spirit</span> <span class="cmt_word">was</span> <span class="cmt_word">not yet</span> (given), <span class="cmt_word">because </span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> This verse has a great weight, as the evangelist's interpretation of the previous words of the Lord, nor can they be put aside. The history of the outpouring of the Spirit on Pentecost, and the mighty gift of the risen and glorified Jesus to those who believed on him, are their abundant justification. If the thirty-eighth verse were not an immense advance upon the promise of the thirty-seventh verse, it would not be easy to show how the words of the first promise could only find fulfilment in a future and as yet unrealized condition. Eternal life is a present gift. Satisfaction of the thirst of the soul was an immediate bestowment of Christ, and had been realized by untold multitudes of those who had been inwardly cleansed by the Spirit, who had come to the waters of life, who had received the Logos, and known that they were sons of God. But the thirty-eighth verse speaks of a new and nobler life flowing to others from belief in Christ. It looks forward to the production of a worldwide blessing conditioned by what was yet to happen. So that we cannot doubt that John saw more deeply into the Lord's words than some of those who have criticized his comment. John, says Weiss, does "not mean to explain the metaphor of the living water, but he intends to prove the truth of Jesus' promise from his own blessed experience." "<span class="accented">The</span> (<span class="accented">Holy</span>) <span class="accented">Spirit was not yet"</span> is, however, a strange and startling statement. The work and Person of the Spirit are spoken of throughout the Old Testament - from <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>; <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a>; <a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>; to <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>. The redeeming and renewing, quickening powers of the Spirit are represented as equipping judges, artists, warriors, and prophets for their work, as sanctifying the individual soul (<a href="/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24, 27</a>), and building the temple of God (<a href="/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a>). The prophetic gift is especially referred to the Spirit by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 11</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). More than this, our Lord himself is, in the synoptic Gospels, said to be conceived by the Holy Spirit, and his humanity baptized and anointed, empowered and directed throughout by the Spirit, and kept by him in sacred consecration and personal union with the Logos. The union of the Divine and human nature of Christ is maintained by that same Spirit who is the union of the Father and of the Son. In what sense can it be said, "the Holy Spirit was not yet"? Our Lord himself has thrown most light upon this perplexing saying when, on promising the Paraclete, he said, "He shall not speak of [or, 'from'] himself: he will take of mine, and show unto you" (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13, 14</a>); and when he declared (<a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7-10</a>) that he must himself go to the Father, resume his antenatal glory, carry our nature, dishonoured by man, but now clothed with an infinite majesty, to the very throne of God, as the condition of the gift of the Paraclete. There was, in the constitution of nature, in the order of providence, in the revelations of the prophets, in the Person of the Son of man, that wherewith the blessed Spirit was ever and ceaselessly working; but not until the atonement was made, till God had glorified his Son Jesus, not until the Person of the God-Man was constituted in its infinity of power and perfection of sympathy, were the facts ready, were the truths liberated for the salvation of men, were the streams of living water ready to flow from every heart that received the Divine gift. In comparison with all previous manifestation of the Spirit, this was so wonderful that John could say of all that had gone before - "<span class="accented">not yet,"</span> "<span class="accented">not yet."</span> The Baptist's expression, "I knew him not" (see note, <a href="/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>), and the scene described in <a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21, 22</a>, do not contradict this (see note). This is the first time that John mentions the glorification of the Son of mart. Jesus certainly looked at his death, with what followed it, as his glory (see <a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>, etc.; John 13:31; 17:5). This evangelist does not, so clearly as St. Paul (says Westcott), discriminate the two stages of "humiliation" and "glory" (cf. <a href="/philippians/2.htm">Philippians 2</a> with <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5, 8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He was speaking</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
