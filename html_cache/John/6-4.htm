It suggests a specific time frame and context for the upcoming actions and teachings of Jesus.<p><b>the Jewish Feast of the Passover</b><br>The Passover is one of the most significant Jewish feasts, commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt as described in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. It involves the sacrifice of a lamb and the eating of unleavened bread, symbolizing the haste of the Israelites' departure. This feast is rich in typology, foreshadowing Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The Passover also points to themes of redemption and deliverance, central to the Gospel message.<p><b>was near</b><br>The timing of the Passover being near is significant, as it sets the context for the miraculous feeding of the 5,000, which follows in the narrative. This proximity to Passover highlights the themes of provision and sustenance, as Jesus provides bread for the multitude, echoing God's provision of manna in the wilderness. The nearness of Passover also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, which will occur during the Passover festival, linking His death to the sacrificial lamb of the original Passover.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish feast commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt.

John opens this verse with an immediate time-marker, grounding the narrative in real history (cf. <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Now&#8221; links what follows to the preceding signs&#8212;showing that Jesus&#8217; next miracle (<a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5-14</a>) is part of an unfolding, purposeful sequence (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; 5:8-9).<p>&#8226; It reminds readers that God&#8217;s redemptive plan advances in specific moments, not vague myths (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Jewish Feast</b><p>&#8226; John calls it &#8220;the feast of the Jews&#8221; because it was one of three pilgrim feasts commanded by God (<a href="/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Mentioning the feast explains why great crowds were on the move toward Jerusalem and thus available to witness the feeding of the five thousand (<a href="/john/6-2.htm">John 6:2</a>; <a href="/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights corporate worship and covenant identity&#8212;Israel gathering to remember God&#8217;s mighty act of salvation (<a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the Passover</b><p>&#8226; Passover commemorates the lamb&#8217;s blood that spared Israel in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-1.htm">Exodus 12:1-14</a>).<p>&#8226; John continually ties Jesus to Passover: <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> (&#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221;), <a href="/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a> (&#8220;the Day of Preparation for the Passover&#8221;), and <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a> (&#8220;Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By situating the feeding miracle at Passover, John prepares us for Jesus&#8217; Bread of Life teaching (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>) and His ultimate self-giving on the cross.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was near</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/matthew/26-18.htm">Matthew 26:18</a>).<p>&#8226; It also explains the massive gathering and the disciples&#8217; logistical concern about feeding the multitude (<a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a> does far more than date a scene. By noting that &#8220;Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near,&#8221; the Spirit anchors the coming miracle in real time, recalls Israel&#8217;s redemption, points forward to Christ&#8217;s sacrificial death, and frames the Bread of Life discourse. The verse reminds us that God orchestrates history so that every sign, feast, and moment converges on Jesus&#8212;the true Lamb who provides lasting deliverance and sustenance for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">A feast.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the feast.</span> Comp. <a href="/john/5-1.htm" title="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 5:1</a>. This is added by St. John only, and is not simply a note of time, but gives a key of interpretation to the sign itself, and to the discourse which followed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.</span> The ordinary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> need not be departed from (cf. <a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a>; <a href="/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2</a>; <a href="/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55</a>). This valuable note of time is confirmed by another hint incidentally dropped. A month later than the Passover it could not be said that "much grass" was in the place. In the late spring such a phrase would most inadequately represent the scene that was indelibly impressed on the fourfold tradition. Whatever the unnamed feast was (<a href="/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1</a>), whether Trumpets, Purim, or Passover, we have reached the month Abib, when the crowds of pilgrims were gathering for their southern journey. If the Purim were the unnamed feast, then the suggestion arises that Christ's reception at Jerusalem had prevented his remaining until the Passover of that year. If the Passover be meant (<a href="/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1</a>), then a year has passed between ch. 5. and 6. Nor is this a day too long for the crowd of events and teachings recorded by the synoptists as having taken place before the death of John. The note of time may be recorded as implying the dominant sentiment in the minds of the people. The great deliverance from Egyptian bondage was burned into the national conscience, and the fanatic desire for a second Moses to lead them out of Roman servitude was at such seasons fanned into a flame. The Lord had his own thought about the Paschal lamb, and knew that God was preparing a Lamb for sacrifice. In mystic, parabolic sense he foreknew that men would and must consume the flesh of this sacrifice. He was ready, moreover, to show them that he could supply all their need. The great Prophet who had said of himself, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" had just fallen beneath the executioner's axe. The people were bereft of a great prophet and leader, and to Christ's eye they were "as sheep without a shepherd." Verily he was preparing to lay down his life as a good Shepherd for these sheep - to provide for them in the future a feast of living bread. All this may rationally be admitted, without for a moment conceding that second-century <span class="accented">ideas</span> like these were the formative causes of the narrative. The miracle that follows stands on an entirely distinct basis, and is more powerfully attested than any ether miracle, except the resurrection of Christ. If it stood in John's record alone, there might be some colour for the supposition that we have merely a parable of great beauty. But the threefold tradition long anterior to John's Gospel deprives even the pseudo-John of the possibility of inventing it. On the other hand, the appearance of the narrative in John's Gospel deprives it of the <span class="accented">mythical</span> character which some have attributed to the authors of the synoptic Gospels. Thoma, in the spirit of Strauss, here imagines that the synoptists were busy in fashioning a miracle of sustenance and a portent upon the waters - a sign on land and sea - to correspond with the manna and Red Sea marvels of the Book of Exodus. "The mountain" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is, as he thinks, a similitude of the Mount Sinai, and, as the latter represented the giving of the Law, this was associated with the mountain of Beatitudes. He goes further, and sees in the Johannine narrative the Christian (<span class="accented">agapae</span>) feasts, and the deliverance of the Apostle Paul from shipwreck! He is even more ingenious still, and suggests that the "five thousand" fed at the first miraculous meal, with twelve baskets of fragments, correspond with the results of the first preaching of the twelve apostles, and that the seven loaves among the four thousand reflect "the many hundreds" who were benefited by the seven evangelists. He endeavours by a most elaborate process to make it appear that John has here combined into one tableau minute traces derived from the five several accounts of the two miracles. The old rationalistic theory was that the miracle was only an exaggerated poetical statement of the fact; that a good example of charity on the part of the apostles was followed by others, and so food was found for the entire multitude. This hypothesis breaks on the rock that the authors of these Gospels intended to convey a perfectly different idea. The effect of such cheap philanthropy and pragmatic travesty of a royal act would not have been that the multitudes would have rushed to the conclusion that he had done a kingly deed, or one in the least way calculated to suggest the notion that he could feed armies at his will. All efforts to extirpate by such theories the supernatural character of the occurrence fail, and force the reader back upon the plain statements of the fourfold narrative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
