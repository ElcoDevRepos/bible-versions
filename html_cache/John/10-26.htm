In the context of <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees, who are questioning His identity and authority. The imagery of sheep and shepherd is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where God is often depicted as the Shepherd of Israel (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>). Jesus, by referring to "My sheep," is asserting His role as the Good Shepherd, a fulfillment of messianic prophecy. The concept of being "not My sheep" implies a lack of relationship and recognition, as sheep naturally follow their shepherd. This distinction is not based on ethnicity or religious status but on spiritual receptivity and recognition of Jesus' voice (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3-4</a>).<p><b>you refuse to believe</b><br>The refusal to believe is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John, where belief in Jesus is central to receiving eternal life (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, <a href="/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>). The Greek word for "refuse" indicates a willful decision, suggesting that the Pharisees' unbelief is not due to a lack of evidence but a hardened heart. This echoes the Old Testament pattern of Israel's unbelief despite witnessing God's works (<a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8-11</a>). Theologically, this phrase underscores the doctrine of human responsibility in the context of divine sovereignty. While Jesus' sheep hear His voice and follow Him, those who are not His sheep choose not to believe, highlighting the mystery of faith and unbelief. This refusal also fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah, where the Messiah would be rejected by His own people (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the Jewish leaders and people who are questioning His identity and authority.

The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20-21</a> Paul explains that refusal to acknowledge God&#8217;s self-evident truth results in darkened hearts; Jesus is identifying the same cause-and-effect here.<p>&#8226; This clause reminds us that unbelief is not merely an intellectual shortfall but a spiritual condition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are not My sheep</b><p>&#8226; Jesus has just identified Himself as &#8220;the good shepherd&#8221; whose sheep &#8220;hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14, 27</a>).<p>&#8226; To be His sheep is to belong to Him by the Father&#8217;s sovereign gift: &#8220;All that the Father gives Me will come to Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a> affirms that &#8220;we are His people, the sheep of His pasture,&#8221; showing continuity between Old and New Testaments in God&#8217;s shepherding care.<p>&#8226; The imagery conveys protection, provision, and intimate knowledge. Those outside the fold lack these blessings and, as <a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32-33</a> illustrates, face ultimate separation.<p>&#8226; By stating &#8220;you are not My sheep,&#8221; Jesus diagnoses their spiritual status: they do not have the relationship that results in recognition of His voice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you refuse to believe</b><p>&#8226; The refusal is willful. <a href="/john/5-40.htm">John 5:40</a> records Jesus saying, &#8220;You refuse to come to Me to have life,&#8221; emphasizing deliberate rejection, not lack of evidence.<p>&#8226; Unbelief fulfills prophecy: <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;Who has believed our message?&#8221;&#8212;and <a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-38</a> show that many would see miracles yet remain hardened.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a> attributes such blindness to the god of this age blinding minds, while <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> warns against &#8220;an unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a> demonstrates that turning from the gospel is a personal choice: &#8220;You reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; statement exposes the underlying reality: their refusal flows from not being His sheep; it is evidence of their alienation from the Shepherd.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/10-26.htm">John 10:26</a> explains that unbelief is the inevitable outcome for those who do not belong to Christ&#8217;s flock. Because they are outside the Shepherd-sheep relationship ordained by the Father, they neither hear nor heed His voice, and they actively resist faith. The verse highlights the divine initiative in salvation and the human responsibility revealed in willful refusal, urging every listener to recognize the Shepherd and follow Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">But ye believe not.</span>--Comp.

They are not, however, without considerable authority, and the fact of their difficulty may have led to their omission. They are sometimes joined to the following verse, and some expositors accept this as their probable meaning; but although the preceding clause of <a href="/john/10-26.htm" title="But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep, as I said to you.">John 10:26</a> was not actually spoken in the previous discourse, it was implied, and the reference is of a like kind to that of the Messiah in <a href="/john/10-25.htm" title="Jesus answered them, I told you, and you believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.">John 10:25</a>. There is no real difficulty in the fact that He thus refers them to a discourse uttered two months before. In continuity of teaching from Him to them it immediately preceded, and at the commencement of this discourse He gathers up the thread of that which had gone before. On the other hand, the interval helps us to understand how He refers to a truth which was taught them, rather than to the actual words in which He taught it. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - He gives the reason of their insensibility or lack of appreciation and faith: <span class="cmt_word">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep</span> (for similar construction, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, see <a href="/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>; <a href="/john/6-65.htm">John 6:65</a>).
