Throughout the Gospel of John, Jesus often speaks in ways that are not immediately clear to His listeners, using parables and metaphors. This method of teaching fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where God tells Isaiah that people will hear but not understand. Jesus' words often require spiritual discernment, which many of His listeners lack.<p><b>&#8216;You will look for Me, but you will not find Me,&#8217;</b><br>This statement can be understood in the context of Jesus' impending crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. After these events, the Jewish leaders and others who rejected Him would seek a Messiah, but they would not find Him because they failed to recognize Him when He was among them. This echoes the theme of spiritual blindness found in <a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10-11</a>, where Jesus came to His own, but His own did not receive Him. It also foreshadows the separation between believers and non-believers, as those who do not accept Jesus will ultimately be unable to find Him.<p><b>and, &#8216;Where I am, you cannot come&#8217;?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates the heavenly realm where Jesus will return after His resurrection. It underscores the separation between those who believe in Jesus and those who do not. In <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>, Jesus speaks of preparing a place for His followers, implying that only those who believe in Him can join Him in the Father's house. This statement also highlights the exclusivity of salvation through Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life. The inability to come where Jesus is points to the spiritual and eternal consequences of rejecting Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the Jewish leaders and the crowd during the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem.

The opportunity to meet Him was right before them, but they would postpone until it was too late, much like the famine of hearing God&#8217;s word foretold in <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11&#8211;12</a>.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41&#8211;44</a> records Jesus weeping over Jerusalem because they &#8220;did not recognize the time of your visitation.&#8221; Looking without surrender always ends in regret.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but you will not find Me</b><p>&#8226; Within months Jesus would die, rise, and ascend (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>). From then on, no amount of temple ritual or intellectual searching could replace a living, personal faith in the risen Lord (<a href="/john/8-21.htm">John 8:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Unbelief blinds the seeker: &#8220;Though seeing, they do not see&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13</a>).

Both here and in ver. 45 we see that the evangelist had access to the ideas and converse of the "Jews," which proves that he had special sources of information to which the ordinary synoptic tradition was strange. The thought grows upon one that John was more than the mere fisherman of the lake. He was a friend of Nicodemus, and known to Caiaphas. It is clear that some further time elapses. This conversation, of which we have the prominent items, the chief utterances, was producing its effect upon the two-sided multitude, upon "the Jews," the "Pharisees," the city party, the chief priests. The Lord probably retired once more to the house of Lazarus or of John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
