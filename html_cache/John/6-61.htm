This awareness is consistent with His ability to perceive the hearts and minds of people, as seen in other passages like <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>. The disciples' grumbling reflects a common human reaction to difficult teachings, similar to the Israelites' murmuring in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). The teaching in question follows Jesus' discourse on being the Bread of Life, which challenged Jewish expectations and traditions, particularly regarding the Messiah and the concept of eating His flesh and drinking His blood (<a href="/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53-58</a>).<p><b>Jesus asked them</b><br>Jesus often used questions to provoke thought and self-reflection, as seen throughout the Gospels. His method of teaching through questions is reminiscent of the rabbinic tradition, encouraging His followers to engage deeply with His words. This approach is evident in other instances, such as when He asked His disciples, "Who do you say I am?" (<a href="/matthew/16-15.htm">Matthew 16:15</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Does this offend you?&#8221;</b><br>The Greek word for "offend" here is "skandalizo," which implies causing someone to stumble or be scandalized. Jesus' question addresses the potential stumbling block His teaching presents, particularly in light of Jewish dietary laws and the symbolic meaning of His words. This moment foreshadows the broader rejection Jesus would face, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>, where the Messiah is described as a stone of stumbling. The question challenges the disciples to examine their faith and understanding, urging them to move beyond surface-level interpretations to grasp the spiritual truths He conveys.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples and addressing their concerns directly.
