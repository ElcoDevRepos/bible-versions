In the context of <a href="/john/7.htm">John 7</a>, Jesus is speaking to a crowd in Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles. The Jewish leaders were judging Him based on their legalistic interpretations and traditions rather than the truth of His teachings. This echoes <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel not to consider appearance but to look at the heart. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on external adherence to the Law, often neglecting the deeper spiritual truths. Jesus challenges this by urging a deeper, more discerning approach.<p><b>and start judging justly.</b><br>Here, Jesus calls for righteous judgment, which aligns with God's standards rather than human biases. This directive is consistent with the biblical principle of justice found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where judges are instructed to judge fairly. The call to judge justly is a call to discernment that goes beyond the surface, seeking truth and righteousness. This reflects the character of God, who is just and righteous in all His ways (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>). In the broader narrative of the Gospel, Jesus embodies perfect justice and calls His followers to reflect this in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching in the temple courts during the Feast of Tabernacles.
