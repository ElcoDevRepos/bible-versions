The supper is the Passover meal, a Jewish tradition commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt. Jesus' actions here are deliberate and symbolic, setting the stage for a profound teaching moment. The act of getting up signifies a transition from fellowship to service, highlighting Jesus' role as a servant leader. This moment is also a precursor to the institution of the Lord's Supper, which would become a central sacrament in Christian worship.<p><b>laid aside His outer garments</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, outer garments were a sign of one's status and role. By laying aside His outer garments, Jesus symbolically sets aside His position and authority, embodying humility and servitude. This act prefigures His ultimate laying aside of divine privilege, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-7</a>, where He "emptied Himself" to take on human form. The removal of His garments also foreshadows His crucifixion, where He would be stripped of His clothing, further emphasizing His sacrifice and vulnerability.<p><b>and wrapped a towel around His waist</b><br>Wrapping a towel around His waist is an act associated with servitude, as it was customary for servants to wash the feet of guests. This action by Jesus is a powerful demonstration of humility and love, serving as a model for His disciples to follow. It reflects the prophecy of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who would bear the burdens of others. The towel symbolizes the cleansing and purification that Jesus offers through His sacrifice, paralleling the spiritual cleansing He provides through His death and resurrection. This act of foot washing is a tangible expression of Jesus' teaching that "the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves" (<a href="/luke/22-26.htm">Luke 22:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is preparing to perform an act of humility and service by washing His disciples' feet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are present at the Last Supper, witnessing and receiving His act of service.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a significant meal shared by Jesus and His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Last Supper takes place, during the time of Passover.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_foot_washing.htm">The Act of Foot Washing</a></b><br>A cultural practice of the time, symbolizing humility and service, which Jesus uses to teach His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_leadership.htm">Humility in Leadership</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates that true leadership involves serving others.

His actions preview the cross and call every believer to the same pattern&#8212;confident in who we are in Him, ready to lay down status and serve.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">He riseth from supper, and laid aside' his garments.</span>--Comp. Notes on Luke 22 <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> We there read of "a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest." It is placed by St. Luke after the Supper; but our Lord's words, "I am among you as he that serveth," point almost certainly to a connection with this parabolic act. There had been, we may well think, some self-assertion in acts or omissions, which He by His act rebukes. They may have claimed, each above his brother, the place of honour at the table, or it may be that no one had offered the customary refreshment of water for the feet, before sitting down to meat (<a href="/luke/7-44.htm" title="And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, See you this woman? I entered into your house, you gave me no water for my feet: but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.">Luke 7:44</a>). "We cannot say what was the immediate cause which suggested His act, but if we attempt to realise the whole scene, we must believe that there was in the disciples themselves some such cause. The garment laid aside would be the outer garment, which would impede His action, leaving the tunic, which was the ordinary dress of a servant.<p>And took a towel, and girded himself.--This was itself a mark of the servant's position, and was meant to signify His assumption of the servant's work. The successive minute details of this picture carry with them their own authenticity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5</span> - Commentators differ as to the motive which induced our Lord to perform this menial act, to adopt the gesture, girding, and duties of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, to divest himself of his <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> or upper garments, and to appear and veritably to act as a slave. Strauss regards it as a mythical representation of one of our Lord's discourses on humility. Lange, with much pertinence, believes it to correspond to the pain, which he manifested, at the very last Supper, with the unseemly contest for pre-eminence among the apostles (cf. <a href="/luke/22-27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>, "Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? I am among you as he that serveth"). Others, like Meyer, see no such reference, and require the presence of no such motive. It is remarkable that at such a season this dispute could have arisen at all. I-laving undoubtedly broken out on more than one occasion, our Lord chose the midst of this feast, when we learn from other sources there was such an outbreak, for this emphatic revelation of the royalty of service. Wunsche ('Erl.,' p. 550) says that both "before" and "alter" the Passover festival it was customary, in order to demonstrate the equality and liberty of the guests, to practice mutual interchanges of the ordinary menial service of <span class="accented">hand-washing</span> ('Pesachin,' fol. 108). In this verse every sentence is a distinct picture. <span class="cmt_word">He riseth from the supper, and layeth down his upper garments, and when he had taken a towel, he girded himself</span> (Edersheim and Wunsche both give proof that the Talmud repeatedly Grecizes the word here rendered "towel," <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "linen cloth," by the word <span class="accented">lentith</span> or <span class="accented">alen-tith</span>) after the fashion of the humblest slave; then <span class="cmt_word">he poureth water into the washing-basin</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), the article of furniture in the room ("Nihil ministerii omittit," says Grotius. Thus he discharges every part of the duty, while the disciples wonder at the new revelation). <span class="cmt_word">And he began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</span> Westcott refers to the rabbinic commentators on <a href="/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a>, "<span class="accented">Among</span> men, the slave washes his master, but with God it is not <span class="accented">so</span>." So then the inversion of all human social relations forced on John's mind the deep truth that we are here face to face with the Divine - with the Divine-human. John here strains his words to give some conception of what passed in his own mind when he saw our Lord's face, and witnessed this great revelation of his character. Though this evangelist did not record the "<span class="accented">Transfiguration</span>," there were moments in Christ's history which produced a still pro-founder impression upon him, and in which he veritably saw the glory of the Only Begotten of God in his Master's form. On this occasion the highest conception of his Divine Personality, origin, and destiny, was blended with the deepest descent of the Lord's entire humanity to the level of weakness, pollution, and sin. The greatest manifestation of God was in the revelation of the exceeding limits, the infinite depth, which love could compass. We may see a little farther on what were the special <span class="accented">steps</span> our Lord took to give this sense of love "<span class="accented">to</span> the uttermost" on the part of him to whom all the universe had been entrusted, who had come from, and was going back to, the Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So] He got up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(egeiretai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1453.htm">Strong's 1453: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I wake, arouse, (b) I raise up.
