The Pharisees were a prominent religious group known for their strict adherence to the Torah and oral traditions. This event occurs in Jerusalem, where the Pharisees held significant influence. The Pharisees often acted as arbiters in religious disputes, and their involvement here underscores the tension between Jesus' miraculous works and the established religious order. This setting foreshadows the growing conflict between Jesus and the religious authorities, as seen in other Gospel accounts.<p><b>the man who had been blind.</b><br>The man in question had been blind from birth, as detailed earlier in the chapter. His healing by Jesus on the Sabbath was a point of contention, as it challenged the Pharisees' interpretation of Sabbath laws. This miracle serves as a sign of Jesus' divine authority and fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as those in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speak of the blind receiving sight. The man's transformation from blindness to sight is symbolic of spiritual enlightenment and the revelation of truth through Christ. This healing also prefigures the spiritual awakening that Jesus offers to those who are spiritually blind.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_born_blind.htm">The Man Born Blind</a></b><br>This individual was healed by Jesus, who restored his sight.

Bringing the case to them looked like the logical next step for a religious verdict on the miracle.<p>&#8226; Earlier, these leaders had already opposed Jesus for healing on the Sabbath (<a href="/john/5-16.htm">John 5:16</a>). Verse 14 reveals that this healing also occurred on a Sabbath, so tension was inevitable.<p>&#8226; Their role highlights a contrast: while Jesus gives sight, the Pharisees often choose spiritual blindness (<a href="/john/7-47.htm">John 7:47-49</a>; <a href="/luke/6-7.htm">Luke 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; God permits scrutiny so that His works may stand the test (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the man who had been blind</b><p>&#8226; Scripture stresses his former condition to spotlight the magnitude of the miracle. <a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a> declares, &#8220;The LORD opens the eyes of the blind,&#8221; and here that promise is literally fulfilled.<p>&#8226; His presence before the Pharisees turns him into a living testimony.

The verse sets up the coming conflict and invites every reader to decide whether to remain in darkness or joyfully testify, &#8220;I was blind, but now I see.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">They brought to the Pharisees.</span>--More exactly, <span class= "ital">They bring</span> . . . The present tense speaks of what they did, as the writer thinks of it in actual occurrence. Their question in the previous verse, and the fact stated in the following verse, seem to indicate that they did this in the spirit of opposition to our Lord. They may have been influenced also, as the parents were, by the agreement of the Jews to excommunicate any who should confess Christ (<a href="/john/9-22.htm" title="These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.">John 9:22</a>). By the term, "to the Pharisees," we are not to understand the Sanhedrin, which did not meet on the Sabbath, and which is not spoken of by St. John as simply "the Pharisees," but a body of the leading Pharisees who were the most bitter foes of Christ, and who seem at this time to have formed practically a permanent committee of the Sanhedrin, always ready to take counsel or action against Him. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/7-32.htm" title="The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.">John 7:32</a>; <a href="/john/7-45.htm" title="Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?">John 7:45</a>; <a href="/john/7-48.htm" title="Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?">John 7:48</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind</span>. The "Pharisees" is not a conclusive definition of the Sanhedrin itself, which is generally denoted by the addition of the phrase, "the chief priests" (<a href="/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32</a> or 45). The Pharisees were a highly organized society, and some well-known gathering of them may have been easily accessible. They were the generally accredited religious guides of the people. One thing militates against such a casual gathering. In ver. 18 the term, "the Jews," the synonym of the ruling ecclesiastical powers in the city, is once more introduced. Moreover, the authorities before whom the discussion and examination were taken appear to possess the power of excommunication from the synagogue. It appears that, in Jerusalem, there existed two minor councils or synagogue-courts, of twenty-three assessors each, corresponding with the similar courts in the Jewish cities, standing in relation to the Sanhedrim and possessing the faculty of delivering the minor degrees of excommunication from the congregation of Israel. It cannot be said that this presentation of the case to an ecclesiastical court of more or less authority necessarily took place on the day of the healing. It is an open question whether the courts sat on the sabbath. There is nothing to prove immediate trial of the matter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They brought</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7948;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Agousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_71.htm">Strong's 71: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; properly, to lead; by implication, to bring, drive, go, pass, or induce.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
