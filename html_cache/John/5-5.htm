The focus on one man highlights the personal nature of Jesus' ministry, emphasizing His compassion and attention to individual needs. This setting is significant as it reflects the broader theme of Jesus' ministry to the marginalized and suffering.<p><b>had been an invalid</b><br>The term "invalid" indicates a severe physical disability, suggesting that the man was unable to walk or care for himself. This condition would have rendered him dependent on others for survival, highlighting the desperation and hopelessness of his situation. In the cultural context of the time, physical ailments were often seen as a result of sin, adding a layer of social stigma to his condition.<p><b>for thirty-eight years</b><br>The duration of thirty-eight years underscores the chronic nature of the man's condition, emphasizing the depth of his suffering and the seeming impossibility of his healing. This long period of illness can be seen as a parallel to the Israelites' 38 years of wandering in the wilderness (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14</a>), symbolizing a time of waiting and testing.

In <a href="/john/5-3.htm">John 5:3</a> we read that &#8220;a great number of the sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed were lying&#8221; at Bethesda, yet verse 5 highlights just &#8220;one man.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows the Lord focusing on one needy soul: &#8220;What do you want Me to do for you?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-51.htm">Mark 10:51</a>) to blind Bartimaeus, or the shepherd leaving ninety-nine to find one sheep (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> promises salvation to &#8220;whoever believes,&#8221; stressing the worth of the individual. Here, before any miracle occurs, we are reminded that God sees each person personally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;There&#8221; anchors the man in a real place&#8212;Bethesda, beside the Sheep Gate pool (<a href="/john/5-2.htm">John 5:2</a>). This is not a parable or myth; it is a historical setting.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a> teaches that God &#8220;determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings.&#8221; The man&#8217;s presence at that pool on that day was no accident; divine providence had arranged the meeting with Jesus.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly ties encounters with God to specific locations&#8212;Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1-2</a>) or Jacob at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-16.htm">Genesis 28:16-17</a>)&#8212;underscoring that God works within tangible history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had been</b><p>&#8226; These words point to a long-standing condition, not a recent mishap. The verb hints at years of disappointment, unanswered hopes, and perhaps fading faith.<p>&#8226; The man born blind in <a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-3</a> had likewise &#8220;been blind from birth,&#8221; and Jesus used that extended suffering &#8220;so that the works of God might be displayed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a> urges believers not to grow weary &#8220;for at the proper time we will reap a harvest.&#8221; Decades of waiting did not disqualify this man from God&#8217;s timing; instead, they set the stage for a greater revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>an invalid</b><p>&#8226; His specific ailment is unnamed, but the term conveys helplessness. He could not reach the water himself (<a href="/john/5-7.htm">John 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical infirmity often pictures spiritual need. In <a href="/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a> Jesus told a paralytic, &#8220;Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.&#8221; Healing the body pointed to healing the soul.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/103-2.htm">Psalm 103:2-3</a> praises the Lord &#8220;who forgives all your iniquity and heals all your diseases,&#8221; reminding us that both kinds of healing flow from the same compassionate heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for thirty-eight years</b><p>&#8226; The length is striking&#8212;almost four decades. Israel wandered thirty-eight of its forty wilderness years after Kadesh-barnea (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14</a>); both narratives highlight prolonged waiting caused by human limitation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a> mentions a man &#8220;lame from birth&#8221; who was over forty when healed, showing again that no span of time is too great for God to break in.<p>&#8226; Second Peter 3:8 notes that &#8220;with the Lord one day is as a thousand years,&#8221; encouraging patience. God&#8217;s delay is never neglect; it serves His perfect purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a> draws our eyes to one specific, real man&#8212;helpless, long-suffering, and seemingly forgotten&#8212;whom Jesus is about to transform. Every detail underscores God&#8217;s personal care, sovereign timing, and power to redeem years of pain in a moment. The verse invites us to trust that the Lord who noticed and healed this man still sees, knows, and is able to act in our lives today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Thirty and eight years.</span>--The period expresses, not his age on the one hand, nor the time of his being at Bethesda on the other, but the time during which he had suffered from the infirmity. Helpless and friendless, having spent half the lot of human life in that condition, he appeals without an uttered word to the Mercy which is present in the House of Mercy; and to him alone of those He healed does Christ of His own accord address the first question. The infirmity was in some way connected with youthful sin (<a href="/john/5-14.htm" title="Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you.">John 5:14</a>), and the sufferer and his history would be well known to those at Jerusalem. The exact knowledge of the writer tells us that for thirty-eight years he had paid sin's. penalty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.</span> He had not lost all his powers - he crawled probably from some near home to the healing well; but for thirty-eight years be had been dragging out his impotent existence. The length implies the inveteracy of the disease. Hengstenberg, Wordsworth, Westcott (in part), imply a marked correspondence between these thirty-eight years and the similar period of time during which Israel was compelled to wander in the wilderness. It is not said how long the man had lain in the five porches waiting listlessly for healing, but that the malady was of old standing, and to all human appearance incurable.
