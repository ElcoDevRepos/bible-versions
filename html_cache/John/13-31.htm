Judas Iscariot's departure signifies the beginning of the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. Judas's exit is not just a physical departure but a spiritual one, as he leaves to betray Jesus. This act fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where a close friend turns against the Messiah. The setting is the Last Supper, a significant event in Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish worship and prophecy.<p><b>Jesus said,</b><br>Jesus' words here are of great importance, as they are spoken in the intimate setting of the Upper Room, where He is with His disciples. This setting is crucial for understanding the gravity and intimacy of His message. Jesus often used these moments to impart deep spiritual truths to His followers.<p><b>&#8220;Now the Son of Man is glorified,</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic title that Jesus frequently used for Himself, drawing from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, which speaks of a divine figure given authority and glory. The term "glorified" here refers to the impending crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus. In the paradox of the cross, what appears to be a moment of defeat is actually the moment of ultimate glorification, as Jesus fulfills His mission of redemption.<p><b>and God is glorified in Him.</b><br>This phrase highlights the unity between Jesus and the Father. The glorification of Jesus through His sacrificial death also glorifies God the Father, as it reveals His love, justice, and mercy. This mutual glorification is a central theme in the Gospel of John, emphasizing the divine nature and mission of Jesus. The cross is the ultimate revelation of God's character and plan for salvation, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples after Judas has left to betray Him.

The going out of Judas is the sign that the betrayal and death of the Son of Man was at hand. In that was the glory of His accomplished work, and He speaks of this glory as present. It lies so immediately before Him that it is at once realised; and the brightness of the vision over-powers all thought of the darkness of the path which leads to it.<p><span class= "bld">God is glorified in him.</span>--This is a re-statement of the thought which has met us whenever the work of the Son has been dwelt upon. It was the Father's work too. The glory of the Son of Man in the redemption of the world was the glory of God, who gave His only-begotten Son, that by Him the world might be saved. There is a contrast drawn here between the humanity and the divinity united in the person of our Lord. In Him, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in His person, in the person of the Son of Man suffering and crucified, there were manifested the attributes of the majesty and glory of God. It was an utterance to the world, in a fulness never heard before, of the Justice, Holiness, and Love which are the nature of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-33.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The glorification of the Son of man, and of the Father in the Son</span>. With ver. 31 the solemn valedictory discourse of our Lord commences - a veritable <span class="accented">evangelium in evangelio</span>, and by the aid of which we come more closely to the heart of Jesus. "Here," as Olshausen says, "we are entering the holy of holies in the Passion-history." We have, indeed, come through the courts of the temple, we have left the courts of the Gentiles, of the women, of the priests behind us, and have been waiting in the holy place of sacrifice and incense and ablution; now we follow our great High Priest to the veil over the holiest of all, and he prepares us to listen to the intercession that he makes before the unveiled majesty of the Father's love. The first section, extending from <a href="/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31-14:31</a>, reports a series of questions by Peter, Thomas, Philip, Jude, which all turn more or less on the anticipated separation which he teaches them to regard as a veritable glorification of the Son of man, and also as a higher revelation to them of the nature of his own Person and of those relations between "the Son" and "the Father" which are imaged and shadowed forth in those between" the Son of man" and "God," which they could more readily understand. This prepares the way for the discourse and prayer which followed, in which the future spiritual union between the victorious Lord and his own disciples, between a sanctified humanity and the eternal Godhead, is exhibited, distinguished by wonderful blending of intuitive insight and supernatural revelation. The discourse is consistent with the stupendous conception which the evangelist had formed of the Person of Christ. Hilgenfeld and ethers regard this address as utterly incompatible with the valedictory discourses of <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24, 25</a>, and <a href="/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>. We have already seen that they are but different aspects of the same mysterious and wonderful Personage; that the synoptists are not silent concerning the spiritual presence of Christ in and with his disciples till the end of the world; and, on the other hand, that the fourth evangelist is perfectly alive to the reality of his kingdom in the world and to the true nature of his second coming. (On the historical character of this discourse, see Introduction, pp. 126, 127.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - (The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> is not omitted by T.R. or Westcott and Holt. It stands on great authority. The different punctuation of Stephens, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f7a;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, dispensed with the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>; but this arrangement is not followed by modern editors.) <span class="cmt_word">When therefore he</span> (Judas) <span class="cmt_word">was gone out</span>, and the Lord was left with his trembling but faithful eleven, his heart yearned over them without reserve or exception, and he speaks as though his Passion had begun, and even ended too. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> suggests more than "is glorified." Bengel says, "Jesus passionem ut breve iter spectatet metam potius prospicit." As Son of man, he has secured the highest glory of the most tender, humiliating self sacrifice, has cast out of the covenanted fellowship the hateful, baneful virus of a carnal triumph. To his eye as Son of man the end is secured, just as in <a href="/john/17-10.htm">John 17:10</a> he says, "I have been glorified in them." The thought is certainly complete without the clause appended in T.R., which simply reiterates the last clause, in order to make it the basis of a further thought: God will glorify him in (himself), if his suffering and sacrificed humanity has been the scene and material of a glory given to God, because a new manifestation of the Divine fullness in humanity; that is the reason why his very humanity will be lifted up into the Divine glory, itself becoming one with it, exalted far above these heavens, that he might fill <span class="accented">all things</span>. Elsewhere we read that "Christ is hidden in God" (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>). All his earthly sufferings will now be seen to be a forth-streaming of Divine love, the fullest revelation of the innermost essence of God (cf. <a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). Godet says, "When God has been glorified by a being, he draws him to his bosom and envelops him <span class="accented">in</span> his glory." This expression scarcely sustains the sublime uniqueness of the glory of God in the Son of man, and the glory of the Son of man in God. The words, <span class="cmt_word">and will straightway glorify him</span> show how imminent was the glorification which is consummated by the new meaning put into death, and into all that leads to it and into the sacrifice involved in it. That "straightway glorify him" is a note of triumph, and this while Judas is completing his bargain (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> of this verse; cf. <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
