In the Old Testament, God is often described as invisible and dwelling in unapproachable light (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). The statement underscores the unique nature of God, who is spirit (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>) and cannot be seen by human eyes. This aligns with the Jewish understanding of God's holiness and separateness from creation.<p><b>except the One who is from God</b><br>This refers to Jesus Christ, who is uniquely qualified to reveal the Father because He comes directly from God. The phrase highlights the divine origin and authority of Jesus, affirming His pre-existence and His role as the mediator between God and humanity. This is consistent with the prologue of John's Gospel, which states that the Word was with God and was God (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>). It also connects to the concept of Jesus as the sent one, a theme prevalent in John's Gospel (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17, 5</a>:36).<p><b>only He has seen the Father</b><br>This statement asserts the exclusive and intimate relationship between Jesus and the Father. It implies that Jesus has a unique understanding and knowledge of God, which He alone can impart to others. This is a claim to His divinity and His role as the ultimate revelation of God to humanity. It echoes the idea found in <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>, where it is said that no one has seen God, but the only Son has made Him known. This also fulfills the prophetic anticipation of a coming Messiah who would reveal God to His people (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6, 11</a>:2).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking about His unique relationship with God the Father.
