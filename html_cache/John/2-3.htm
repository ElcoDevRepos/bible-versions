Wine was a symbol of joy and celebration in Jewish culture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, which speaks of wine gladdening the heart. The shortage highlights the limitations of human resources and sets the stage for Jesus' first public miracle, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion.<p><b>Jesus&#8217; mother said to Him</b><br>Mary's involvement suggests her close relationship with the wedding hosts, possibly indicating family ties. Her approach to Jesus implies a level of expectation and trust in His ability to address the situation. This interaction also reflects the cultural norm of familial responsibility and honor, where family members would assist in resolving social dilemmas.<p><b>&#8220;They have no more wine.&#8221;</b><br>Mary's statement is both a factual observation and an implicit request for help. It reflects her awareness of the potential disgrace for the hosts and her confidence in Jesus' ability to intervene. This moment foreshadows the transformative power of Jesus' ministry, where He often meets physical needs as a sign of His spiritual mission. The lack of wine can also symbolize the insufficiency of the old covenant, with Jesus introducing the new covenant through His ministry, as later seen in the Last Supper (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs His first recorded miracle at the wedding in Cana.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary,_the_mother_of_jesus.htm">Mary, the Mother of Jesus</a></b><br>- She plays a pivotal role in this event by bringing the problem of the lack of wine to Jesus' attention.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wedding_at_cana.htm">The Wedding at Cana</a></b><br>- A significant event where Jesus performs His first miracle, turning water into wine, symbolizing the beginning of His public ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>- Followers of Jesus who witness this miracle, which strengthens their faith in Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cana_of_galilee.htm">Cana of Galilee</a></b><br>- The location of the wedding, a small town in Galilee, which becomes the setting for Jesus' first miracle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_jesus.htm">Dependence on Jesus</a></b><br>Just as Mary brought the problem to Jesus, we should bring our concerns and needs to Him, trusting in His ability to provide.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Mary's faith in Jesus' ability to address the situation serves as a model for us to have faith in His power and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_obedience.htm">The Role of Obedience</a></b><br>The servants' obedience in following Jesus' instructions is crucial to the miracle, teaching us the importance of obedience in our walk with Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_abundance.htm">God's Abundance</a></b><br>The transformation of water into wine signifies the abundance of God's blessings and His ability to provide beyond our expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_beginning_of_miracles.htm">The Beginning of Miracles</a></b><br>This event marks the beginning of Jesus' public ministry and serves as a sign of His divine authority and mission.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_2_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 2:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Mary_s_faith_to_daily_challenges.htm">How can we apply Mary's faith in Jesus to our daily challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/John_2_3_Seek_Jesus_in_need.htm">What does John 2:3 teach about seeking Jesus in times of need?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mary_s_request_trusting_God_s_timing.htm">How does Mary's request connect to trusting God's timing in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_show_faith_like_Mary_in_John_2_3.htm">In what ways can we demonstrate faith like Mary in John 2:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Jesus_respond_to_prayers.htm">How does this verse illustrate Jesus' responsiveness to our concerns and prayers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_tell_Jesus_about_wine_shortage.htm">Why did Mary inform Jesus about the wine shortage in John 2:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Wine_shortage_meaning_in_John_2_3.htm">What does the wine shortage symbolize in John 2:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_2_3_Jesus_bond_with_Mary.htm">How does John 2:3 reflect Jesus' relationship with His mother?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_marriage_honorable_for_all.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'My hour has not yet come'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_cana's_wedding_feast_historically_credible.htm">How credible is the historical setting of a large wedding feast in Cana (John 2:1&#8211;11), given limited archeological evidence for the town?

And yet the answer does not seem far to seek. The next verses fix its meaning as the expectation of an outcome of supernatural power. This is quite in harmony with the mother's hopes and musings, without any previous miracle on which to base them (<a href="/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>). For many long years she had kept in her heart the Son's words and deeds (<a href="/luke/2-51.htm" title="And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.">Luke 2:51</a>). She must have heard of John the Baptist's witness, of the events of the Baptism six weeks now past, and on that very day every hope must have started into new life, as she heard from those who came with Him how conviction had seized upon their own minds. To cause the. increase of meal, and prevent the failure of the cruse of oil (<a href="/1_kings/17-14.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.">1Kings 17:14</a>), was within the power of the prophet whom they expected as herald of the Messiah. Here was an unexpected need, caused, it may be, by the presence of Himself and followers at that festival. Can He not, will He not, supply the need, and prove Himself indeed the Christ?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - A large accession of guests in such a humble home might easily be supposed to make a famine in the provisions, and so we read, <span class="cmt_word">And when the wine failed</span> - either from this cause, or from the poverty of the hosts, whose willingness and welcome were larger than their means, or by reason of an advanced stage in the festival - <span class="cmt_word">the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have no</span> <span class="cmt_word">wine</span>. The simple presence of the Lord and of his mother, of such guests as these. at a wedding feast, is a Divine rebuke of all that morbid asceticism which crept from Essenism and Orientalism into the Christian Church, of all that false pietism and fancied purity which made marriage a contamination, and exalted virginity to an unnatural elevation. The tender hearted interest felt by the blessed mother of the Lord in the condition of the hosts, and her tone of authority towards the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, are eminently natural; her tacit request for help, though she does not specify the way in which the help should be given, implies on her part something of presumption in indicating to our Lord the course he should adopt. A question of great interest arises - What did she mean by her appeal? Bengel suggested that Mary simply intended: "Let us depart before the poverty of our hosts reveals itself." This makes Christ's reply an acceptance of her hint; but along other lines the rabbis were accustomed to say that wine and life were in the mouth of a rabbi (see Geikie's 'Life of Christ,' 1:475; Wunsche, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). We are expressly told that this is the beginning of signs, and therefore we have no right to conclude that, previous to this, in the home at Nazareth, Jesus had been accustomed to conquer fate and master poverty and compel circumstances by miraculous powers for his own or for his mother's support. We know that it was a temptation of the devil that he should perform some such miracle for his own sustenance, and that he had sternly suppressed the suggestion of the evil one. The mother must have known his powers, and must have known his mind on this very matter. What did she suggest? Was she thinking mainly of the need of wine, or firstly and chiefly of the honour and glory of her Son? She supposed that a moment had arrived when he should by some royal act assert his imperial rights, and give an order which would be obeyed as that of Sovereign Prince. Precisely the same spirit prevailed always in his home and among his disciples - an eager desire that he should manifest himself to the world (cf. <a href="/john/7-4.htm">John 7:4-6</a>). The disciples did not lose it on the night of the Passion, or the eve of the Ascension (<a href="/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22</a>; <a href="/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>). If this was the real meaning of the remark, "They have no wine," it becomes singularly interesting to observe the method of our Lord. The request for a supply of additional solace and refreshment <span class="accented">was</span> complied with. The suggestion to show himself to the world was as resolutely withheld. There was no pomp, no claim, no self-assertion; there was quiet, boundless, affluent love. The glory of Divine love was manifested, the need was satisfied; but the impression was not intended to go beyond the hearts of those beings who would partially understand it, at the right time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] wine</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7988;&#957;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(oinou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3631.htm">Strong's 3631: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wine.
