Their fear of "the Jews" refers specifically to the Jewish religious leaders, particularly the Pharisees, who held significant power and influence. This fear was not uncommon, as the religious leaders could impose social and religious sanctions. The parents' fear highlights the tension between Jesus' followers and the Jewish authorities. This tension is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where the religious leaders often oppose Jesus' ministry. The fear of being ostracized from the community was a powerful motivator, as Jewish identity was closely tied to religious and social life.<p><b>For the Jews had already determined that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.</b><br>The decision to expel anyone confessing Jesus as the Christ from the synagogue reflects the growing hostility towards Jesus and His followers. This expulsion, known as "herem," was a form of excommunication that severed individuals from the religious and social life of the Jewish community. The synagogue was central to Jewish worship, education, and community life, so being put out was a severe punishment. This determination by the Jewish leaders underscores their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah, despite the signs and miracles He performed. This rejection fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected. The early church faced similar challenges, as seen in Acts, where the apostles often encountered opposition from Jewish authorities. This passage foreshadows the growing divide between traditional Jewish beliefs and the emerging Christian faith, which recognized Jesus as the promised Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parents_of_the_blind_man.htm">The Parents of the Blind Man</a></b><br>They are central to this verse as they respond to the Pharisees' questioning about their son's healing.

The word rendered "agreed" occurs again in the New Testament only twice. It expresses the covenant made with Judas, in <a href="/luke/22-5.htm" title="And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.">Luke 22:5</a>, and the agreement of the Jews to kill Paul, in <a href="/acts/23-20.htm" title="And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire you that you would bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.">Acts 23:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He should be put out of the synagogue.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/16-2.htm" title="They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes, that whoever kills you will think that he does God service.">John 16:2</a>, and Note on <a href="/luke/6-22.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.">Luke 6:22</a>. The Jews at a later date distinguished three kinds of excommunication. (1) The lightest continued for thirty days, and prescribed four cubits as a distance within which the person may not approach any one, not even wife or children; with this limitation, it did not make exclusion from the synagogue necessary. (2) The severer included absolute banishment from all religious meetings, and absolute giving up of intercourse with all persons, and was formally pronounced with curses. (3) The severest was a perpetual banishment from all meetings, and a practical exclusion from the fellowship of God's people. It has been sometimes supposed that the words of <a href="/luke/6-22.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.">Luke 6:22</a>, (<span class= "ital">a</span>) "separate you," (<span class= "ital">b</span>)<span class= "ital"> "</span>reproach you," (c) "cast out your name," refer to these gradations, but probably the only practice known in the time of our Lord was that which was later regarded as the intermediate form, falling short of perpetual banishment, but being, while the ban lasted, exclusion from all the cherished privileges of an Israelite. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The evangelist accounts for the reticence of the parents by their fear of consequences. <span class="cmt_word">These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews.</span> This passage provides strong evidence of the technical use of the term "the Jews."

The Talmud speaks of three kinds of excommunication (cf. also <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>), of which the first two were disciplinary; the third answers to complete and final expulsion (in 'Jeremiah Moed. K.,' 81, d, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5dc;</span>, Edersheim). The general designation was <span class="accented">shammata</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, to destroy. The first form of it was called <span class="accented">nesephah</span>, and did not amount to more than severe rebuke. It would exclude from religious privileges for seven or thirty days, according to the dignity of the authority by whom it was pronounced (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/5-1.htm">1 Timothy 5:1</a>). The second form of <span class="accented">shammata</span> was called <span class="accented">niddui</span>, which lasted for thirty days at the least, and might be repeated at the end of them. If these admonitions failed to produce their right effect, it might lead to the third and final excommunication, called <span class="accented">cherem</span>, or ban, whose duration was indefinite. The second of these forms was accompanied by blast of trumpet and terrible curses, which deprived the sufferer of all kinds of social intercourse. He was avoided as a leper; if he died, he was buried without funeral or mourning. The <span class="accented">cherem</span> was even a more terrible anathema, and might last for life. The parents of the blind man might easily fear such a curse. The ban to which this blind man was eventually exposed did not prevent him from moving about the city. The ban pronounced on Jesus led doubtless to the condemnation, issuing in his ignominy and trial for a capital offence. It was probably the second of the three forms of anathema to which he was ultimately condemned. It was quite sufficient temptation for these poor parents to have preserved an obstinate reticence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
