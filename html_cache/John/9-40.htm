They often positioned themselves as authorities on religious matters. In this context, they were present during Jesus' teaching and miracles, including the healing of the man born blind. Their presence indicates their ongoing scrutiny of Jesus' actions and teachings. The Pharisees' role in society was significant, as they were influential in both religious and social spheres, often challenging Jesus' authority and interpretation of the Law.<p><b>and they asked Him</b><br>The Pharisees' question to Jesus reflects their skepticism and challenge to His authority. Throughout the Gospels, they frequently question Jesus to test Him or to find grounds for accusation. This interaction is part of a larger narrative where Jesus' miracles and teachings often provoke questions and debates about His identity and mission. The act of questioning was a common method in rabbinic tradition, used to engage in theological discussion and debate.<p><b>&#8220;Are we blind too?&#8221;</b><br>This question reveals the Pharisees' misunderstanding of spiritual blindness. While they were physically able to see, Jesus often used blindness metaphorically to describe a lack of spiritual insight or understanding. The Pharisees' question is ironic because, despite their religious knowledge, they fail to recognize Jesus as the Messiah. This theme of spiritual blindness is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet speaks of people who see but do not perceive. Jesus' response to the Pharisees highlights the contrast between physical sight and spiritual insight, a recurring theme in His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

The passage invites every reader to trade self-confidence for humble faith, letting the Light of the world open our eyes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">And some of the Pharisees which were with him.</span>--The words in the preceding verse are not addressed specially to any one. The Pharisees would be still watching our Lord, and some had probably followed the beggar, expecting that our Lord would seek him, and hoping that the interview might furnish some ground for a fresh charge against one or both of them. It is the presence of mental conditions such as theirs and such as his that has brought again to our Lord's thoughts the judicial result of His manifestation, and this rises to His lips as an utterance of the solemn thought that fills His mind. The Pharisees hear this exclamation, and apply to themselves that which their own state suggested; but which was expressed as, and is, a wide law, holding true for all mankind.<p><span class= "bld">Are we blind also?</span>--They misunderstand His words, for He has asserted of the blind ("they which see not") that the result of His coming is "that they might see." But yet they do not understand the words in a physical sense, in which they could have had no application to themselves. Care is required to catch the force of the term in these three verses, and it may be well to distinguish again the meanings attached to the word blind. It is used (1) for physical blindness. This has been its meaning throughout the chapter. It suggests the imagery in these verses, but is not itself present in the thought which is of spiritual, blindness only. (2) For conscious spiritual blindness ("they which see not," "they which think they see not"), which is really the first step to spiritual sight. (3) For unconscious spiritual blindness ("they which see," "they which think they see"), which is really the first step to a total loss of spiritual perception.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Those of the Pharisees who were with him</span>. This expression does not simply mean who were near him at that moment, but who were to a certain extent siding with him (<a href="/john/8-30.htm">John 8:30, 31</a>), while criticizing and rejecting his message; who were incensed with him for promising to them "freedom" and sonship, and whose faith in his claims was of the most superficial and vacillating kind. These wavering, self-satisfied Pharisees <span class="cmt_word">heard these things, and they said to him, Are we blind also</span>? Many commentators, who call attention to the contrast between the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 39, think that the speakers who made use of this word did not draw the distinction, and meant nothing more than their use <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> by of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. But this is unsatisfactory; whatever it 'means in the one clause, it ought to mean in the other. There is a difference between "<span class="accented">becoming blind</span>," and being "the <span class="accented">blind</span>." They ask whether <span class="accented">they</span> are <span class="accented">blind also</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as blind as those who have, according to Christ's own dictum, <span class="accented">become</span> so.
