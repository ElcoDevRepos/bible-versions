It marks a new era in the relationship between God and believers, where direct access to the Father is granted through Jesus Christ. This is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the new covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><b>you will no longer ask Me anything.</b><br>Jesus indicates a shift in how His disciples will communicate with God. Previously, they relied on Jesus' physical presence to ask questions and seek guidance. After His ascension, they will have the Holy Spirit to guide them into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>), and they will pray directly to the Father.<p><b>Truly, truly, I tell you,</b><br>The double "truly" (amen, amen) emphasizes the certainty and importance of what Jesus is about to say. This phrase is used throughout the Gospels to highlight significant teachings of Jesus, underscoring His authority and the trustworthiness of His words.<p><b>whatever you ask the Father in My name,</b><br>Praying in Jesus' name signifies praying with His authority and in alignment with His will. It reflects a relationship with God that is mediated by Christ, who is the only way to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This concept is rooted in the understanding of Jesus as the High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>He will give you.</b><br>This promise assures believers of God's willingness to respond to prayers that are in accordance with His will.
