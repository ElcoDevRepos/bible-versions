This moment occurs after Jesus arrives in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, following the death of Lazarus. The act of coming to Jesus signifies her faith and recognition of His authority. In the cultural context, women often played significant roles in mourning, and Mary's approach to Jesus highlights her personal relationship with Him. This scene is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals seek Jesus for healing and comfort, such as the woman with the issue of blood (<a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>).<p><b>she fell at His feet</b><br>Falling at Jesus' feet is an act of worship, submission, and desperation. In Jewish culture, bowing or falling at someone's feet was a sign of respect and acknowledgment of authority. This gesture indicates Mary's belief in Jesus' power and her deep sorrow. It parallels other instances in the Gospels where individuals fall at Jesus' feet, such as the leper in <a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>, demonstrating faith and reverence.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.&#8221;</b><br>Mary's statement reflects both faith and a hint of reproach. She acknowledges Jesus as "Lord," indicating her belief in His divine authority. Her words express a common human struggle with understanding God's timing and presence in suffering. This mirrors Martha's earlier statement in <a href="/john/11-21.htm">John 11:21</a>, showing a shared belief in Jesus' ability to heal. The phrase also highlights the tension between human expectation and divine purpose, as Jesus had delayed His arrival to demonstrate a greater miracle. This moment foreshadows the resurrection of Lazarus, serving as a type of Christ's own resurrection and the ultimate victory over death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The sister of Martha and Lazarus, known for her devotion to Jesus.
