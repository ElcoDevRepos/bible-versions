The "therefore" connects His response to their suggestion, indicating a reasoned reply. Jesus often used such moments to teach deeper spiritual truths, emphasizing His divine mission and timing.<p><b>Although your time is always at hand</b><br>Jesus contrasts His divine mission with the worldly perspective of His brothers. Their "time" refers to their freedom to act according to their own desires and schedules. This reflects the human tendency to operate independently of God's timing and purpose. In a broader sense, it highlights the difference between human and divine perspectives on time and purpose.<p><b>My time has not yet come</b><br>This phrase underscores Jesus' awareness of His divine mission and the specific timing ordained by God. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus is conscious of the "hour" or "time" set by the Father for His actions, particularly His crucifixion and resurrection. This reflects the prophetic nature of His ministry, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. It also emphasizes His obedience to the Father's will, a key aspect of His role as the perfect servant and sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is speaking to His brothers in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_brothers.htm">Jesus' Brothers</a></b><br>They are urging Jesus to go to Judea to show His works, but they do not yet believe in Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea.htm">Judea</a></b><br>The region where Jesus' brothers want Him to go, specifically to the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, during which Jesus' brothers suggest He should reveal Himself.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents the unbelieving society that is contrasted with Jesus' divine mission and timing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_timing.htm">Understanding Divine Timing</a></b><br>Jesus exemplifies patience and obedience to God's timing, teaching us to trust in God's perfect plan for our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worldly_vs._divine_perspective.htm">Worldly vs. Divine Perspective</a></b><br>Jesus contrasts His divine mission with the worldly perspective of His brothers, reminding us to seek God's will rather than conforming to worldly expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_unbelief.htm">Faith and Unbelief</a></b><br>The unbelief of Jesus' brothers highlights the challenge of faith, encouraging us to pray for those who struggle to believe in Jesus' identity and mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purposeful_living.htm">Purposeful Living</a></b><br>Jesus' awareness of His mission encourages us to live purposefully, aligning our actions with God's calling and timing for our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/patience_in_god's_plan.htm">Patience in God's Plan</a></b><br>Just as Jesus waited for the right time, we are called to be patient and trust that God will fulfill His promises in His perfect timing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_7_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_7_6_God_s_perfect_timing_lesson.htm">How does John 7:6 teach us about God's perfect timing in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_My_time_has_not_yet_come.htm">What does Jesus mean by "My time has not yet come" in John 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_know_God_s_timing_per_John_7_6.htm">How can we discern God's timing in our decisions, based on John 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_7_6_Eccles_3_1_on_timing.htm">Connect John 7:6 with Ecclesiastes 3:1 about timing and seasons in life.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_patience_like_Jesus_did.htm">How can we apply patience in waiting for God's timing as Jesus did?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_My_time_has_not_yet_come_2.htm">What does Jesus mean by "My time has not yet come" in John 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_7_6_Jesus_on_divine_timing.htm">How does John 7:6 reflect Jesus' understanding of divine timing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_timing_differ_in_John_7_6.htm">Why does Jesus differentiate His timing from His brothers' in John 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_marriage_honorable_for_all.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'My hour has not yet come'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_did_jesus_attend_the_feast_secretly.htm">John 7:10 &#8211; How could Jesus go to the Feast secretly when such a gathering would have been highly public?

Note on <a href="/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>. Here, as there, He regards the events of life as marked out by divinely-ordered seasons. There is for Him a time for solemnly entering Jerusalem with a throng of pilgrims going up to a feast, and in a few months it will have come; but it has not come yet. It is at the feast of the Paschal Lamb, already set apart, and not with the joyous shouts of harvest-tide.<p><span class= "bld">Your time is alway ready.</span>--They may go now as then. Of the nation, their thoughts and feelings are in sympathy with the national feasts. They can join in the festive throng keeping holiday, and take their part in the Temple service. For Him present events have another meaning. Desertion of disciples, threatenings of Jews, unbelief of brethren--all this means that the end is approaching, and that His time is at hand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus then saith to them</span> (to his brothers), <span class="cmt_word">My time</span> (the "season" for my full manifestation to the nation of what I am, or the time to disclose my own idea of my own commission) <span class="cmt_word">is</span> <span class="cmt_word">not</span> <span class="cmt_word">yet</span> <span class="cmt_word">present.</span> The season or opportunity for my final self-revelation pauses, and I pause for an intimation of the Father's will. This language corresponds with the reply to his mother, "My hour is not yet come" to do what you blindly desire. The kind of manifestation he subsequently made on that occasion was one of love to the needy, not one of power to dazzle the world (see notes, <a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). The underlying thought which the postponement suggested was that the approach of Jesus to Jerusalem with the pilgrim throng would be the signal for the final outburst of bitter hostility which he knew was smouldering in the hearts of the Sanhedrists, and would also be the torch applied to the magazine of combustible passion in which he would sacrifice his life. <span class="cmt_word">But your time</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">season which is yours</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is always ready.</span> The brothers were at liberty at any time to show themselves and their works to the world. They had plans akin to those of the world. They shared the fashion of religious thought, the ideal of the Israelitish world, completely. James, for instance, Nazarite though he may have been, punctilious in traditionary ritual, and honouring the conservative passions of his order, might at any time secure the acclamations or approval of the chief powers of the world - their little world. "I" (Christ implied) "wait for the predetermined hour, for the kind of appearance in Jerusalem which will be the giving of my flesh for the life of the world. You are so much in harmony with the world that at any time you may say all that is in your heart. If I go as you suggest, it must be as Messiah; you go as pious pilgrims to share in this national celebration." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
