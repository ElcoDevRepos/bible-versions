The term "criminal" here reflects their accusation against Jesus, implying He has committed offenses worthy of Roman intervention. In the Jewish context, the leaders viewed Jesus as a blasphemer for claiming to be the Son of God (<a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>). Theologically, this accusation is ironic because Jesus, who is sinless (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>), is being labeled a criminal. This reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, where the Messiah is "numbered with the transgressors."<p><b>they replied,</b><br>The Jewish leaders are responding to Pilate's question about the charges against Jesus. This interaction highlights the tension between Jewish and Roman authorities. The Jewish leaders are trying to manipulate the Roman legal system to achieve their goal of executing Jesus, as they lacked the authority to carry out capital punishment (<a href="/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a>).<p><b>we would not have handed Him over to you.</b><br>This phrase indicates the Jewish leaders' insistence on Jesus' guilt. Their statement is an attempt to pressure Pilate into accepting their judgment without further investigation. Historically, this reflects the complex relationship between the Jewish authorities and the Roman government, where the former had to navigate Roman legal structures to maintain their religious and social order. This handing over of Jesus is a pivotal moment in the Passion narrative, fulfilling Jesus' own predictions about His death (<a href="/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>) and illustrating the theme of divine sovereignty in the midst of human injustice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being accused and handed over to the Roman authorities by the Jewish leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The religious authorities who are accusing Jesus of being a criminal and are responsible for handing Him over to the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea, who is responsible for adjudicating the case against Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place, significant as the center of Jewish religious life and the location of the Temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_authority.htm">Roman Authority</a></b><br>Represents the political power of the time, under which the Jewish leaders sought to have Jesus executed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_false_accusations.htm">Understanding False Accusations</a></b><br>The Jewish leaders accused Jesus of being a criminal without just cause.

They bring no legal charge against Jesus, but assert, in effect that they themselves, who understood and had investigated the whole matter, had condemned Him to death, and that the fact that they had done so was in itself sufficient proof that He was worthy of death. They use the vague word "malefactor," "evil-doer," though in the trial before Caiaphas they had not sought to prove any evil deed, and they expect that upon this assertion Pilate will pronounce on Him, as on other malefactors, the sentence of death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They answered and said, if</span> <span class="cmt_word">he were not a malefactor,</span> <span class="cmt_word">we should not have delivered him up to thee.</span> This was somewhat audacious. It was as much as to say, "We have judged, you have only to register our decisions. We are not bound to go through our evidence before you." If it had been so, the deprivation of the <span class="accented">jus gladii</span>, the power of capital execution would have mattered little to them. Pilate, in scorn and irony, replies, "If that be so, why have ye brought him to me? If you are unwilling to comply with the terms of Roman jurisprudence, then it must be some ease which you can dispose of according to your own rules." <span class="cmt_word">Take ye him yourselves, and according to your Law judge him</span>. Pilate saw their animus, and that they were thirsting for the blood of Jesus, and wished at once to flout them and make them confess their impotence and admit his suzerainty. For them to judge (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) was not equivalent to put to death (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and Pilate clearly suggested that much. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews</span> [<span class="cmt_word">therefore</span>] <span class="cmt_word">said to him, It is not lawful</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to us to put any man to death.</span> This was perfectly true, notwithstanding the tumultuary and violent acts and threats, and incipient stonings of Jesus, to which the Gospel refers (<a href="/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3, 59</a>; <a href="/john/7-25.htm">John 7:25</a>). Other interpretations of this exclamation have been supplied, viz. "to execute criminals of state" (Krebs), "to do so on feast-days" (Semler); but the power had been formally taken from even the supreme court, forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem. The instance of the massacre of James the Just, occurring between the departure of one Roman governor and the arrival of another, is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.,' 20:09. 1) as a distinct infringement and violation of law. The stoning of Stephen in a wild tumult, and the proceedings of Herod Agrippa, are rather confirmations than violations of the rule. Thus the malign disposition and distinct purpose of the Jews were revealed. They would not have brought Jesus at all before the Roman governor, nor admitted his claim to decide any case involving religious ideas and practices, if they had not fully decided that Jesus must die. Bat John sees a deeper reason still. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
