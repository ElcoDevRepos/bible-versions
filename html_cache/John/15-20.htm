In the Jewish tradition, oral teachings were highly valued, and disciples were expected to memorize and live by their rabbi's words. Jesus often reminded His disciples of His teachings to prepare them for future challenges. This call to remembrance is a common biblical theme, seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, where the Israelites are urged to remember God's commandments.<p><b>&#8216;No servant is greater than his master.&#8217;</b><br>This statement reflects a common cultural understanding in the ancient world, where a servant's status was inherently linked to their master. It underscores the principle of humility and submission, which Jesus exemplified. This teaching is also found in <a href="/john/13-16.htm">John 13:16</a>, where Jesus uses it to explain the necessity of serving others, as He did by washing the disciples' feet. It highlights the expectation that followers of Christ will share in His experiences, including suffering.<p><b>If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well;</b><br>Here, Jesus prepares His disciples for the reality of persecution. Historically, early Christians faced significant persecution from both Jewish authorities and the Roman Empire. This persecution is documented in Acts and the epistles, such as <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>, which states that all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. The phrase also connects to the prophetic suffering of the Messiah, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>if they kept My word, they will keep yours as well.</b><br>This phrase offers a measure of hope and continuity. It suggests that just as some people responded positively to Jesus' message, there will be those who respond to the disciples' teachings. This reflects the early church's experience, where despite persecution, many came to faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>.

The disciples are not to expect better treatment from the world than their Lord met with. If they (used of "the world 7, in its special concrete manifestations; "they" of Nazareth and Capernaum and Jerusalem correspond with the "they" of Lycaonia, Ephesus, Thessalonica, and Rome) persecuted me, they will persecute - drive away from them - you also. The "if" is remarkably explicit; there is no doubt about it in Christ's case, and the supposition is one of definite and acknowledged fact, and the conditional sentence most positively assures them of antagonism and persecution. It is probable, though not certainly known, that these disciples all endured a living martyrdom, if not a cruel death in his cause. Then follows a sentence which has by some unwisely been supposed to be ironical, and by others to refer to another subject. <span class="cmt_word">If they</span> - others, or many, or some - <span class="cmt_word">kept</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.
