It highlights the continuity of God's relationship with His chosen people throughout generations. The term "fathers" is often used in Scripture to denote the patriarchs and those who came before, emphasizing a shared heritage and collective memory.<p><b>ate the manna</b><br>Manna was the miraculous food provided by God to the Israelites during their 40 years in the wilderness, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>. It appeared each morning as a fine, flaky substance, and was described as tasting like wafers made with honey. Manna symbolizes God's provision and care, but also serves as a type of Christ, the true bread from heaven, as Jesus later explains in this chapter.<p><b>in the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness refers to the desert region where the Israelites wandered after their exodus from Egypt. This period of wandering was both a time of testing and divine provision. Geographically, the wilderness was a harsh environment, underscoring the miraculous nature of God's sustenance. Spiritually, it represents a place of dependence on God and a journey towards the Promised Land.<p><b>yet they died</b><br>Despite receiving manna, the Israelites eventually died, indicating that the manna was a temporary provision that sustained physical life but could not grant eternal life. This serves as a contrast to the spiritual sustenance offered by Jesus, who provides eternal life. The mortality of those who ate the manna underscores the need for a greater, lasting provision, which Jesus claims to fulfill as the bread of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers.htm">Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who wandered in the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt.

He affirms the event&#8217;s historicity yet steers them to its deeper meaning.<p>&#8226; Even miraculous food, if only physical, cannot satisfy the soul. <a href="/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24&#8211;25</a> records the wonder; <a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32&#8211;33</a> reveals the greater wonder, the true Bread.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the wilderness</b><p>&#8226; The setting accentuates need.

Its true relation to Him is shown in the fact that those who ate it afterwards died; whereas He is the true spiritual food for the world, and those who feed upon Him shall not afterwards die. That was manna, special in time and circumstance; this is bread, the true sustenance for all times and all circumstances. That seemed to them to come from heaven, and this from earth; but this outer earth-born form of flesh contains the true life, in the only way in which humanity could receive it. The life itself cometh down from heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 49, 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</span> The Lord went back to the very words of the Jews in ver. 31. The Heaven-given manna by which Jehovah sustained the temporal life of the fathers in the wilderness did not convey the antidote to death. "The carcases [of these fathers] fell in the wilderness." He does not say, "perished out of God's sight forever," or were condemned, but that there was nothing in the eating of manna which arrested, or averted, or triumphed, over death; yet he added: <span class="cmt_word">This</span> (<span class="cmt_word">Bread</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">life</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is the Bread which cometh down from heaven, in order that</span> <span class="cmt_word">any one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">may eat thereof, and may not</span> die. The eating of the Bread of life (the life-giving Bread), which I myself am, the thorough assimilation, the entire acceptance of me as God's Gift of life to the world, confers the very principle of life; and, though a partaker may seem to perish, he does <span class="accented">not die</span> (cf. <a href="/john/8-51.htm">John 8:51-11:26</a>, notes) - he will not "taste of death," "he will never die." The life will be stronger than death; it will survive apparent extinction. Meyer says that here Christ reserves to ver. 51 the positive offer "of his own concrete Personality, and is exhibiting the true Bread, according to its real nature." Still he has said, "I am the life-giving Bread," and is undoubtedly preparing for the following announcement, which adds a new and startling thought, calculated to sustain the former one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Your</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hym&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
