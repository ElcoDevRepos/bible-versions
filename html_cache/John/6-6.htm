The context is the feeding of the five thousand, a miracle that demonstrates Jesus' divine power and compassion. The "test" here is not a temptation to sin but a means to strengthen Philip's faith and understanding. Testing in the Bible often serves to reveal the heart and to prepare individuals for greater responsibilities (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>). Jesus frequently used questions to provoke thought and insight, as seen in His interactions throughout the Gospels. This method of teaching aligns with rabbinic traditions of the time, where questions were used to engage students deeply.<p><b>for He knew</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' omniscience, a key attribute of His divine nature. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus demonstrates knowledge that surpasses human understanding, such as knowing the thoughts of others (<a href="/matthew/9-4.htm">Matthew 9:4</a>) and foreseeing future events (<a href="/john/13.htm">John 13:1</a>). This foreknowledge is consistent with Old Testament depictions of God, who declares the end from the beginning (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>). Jesus' knowledge here reassures believers of His sovereignty and control over all circumstances.<p><b>what He was about to do</b><br>Jesus' awareness of His impending actions underscores His intentionality and purpose. The miracle of feeding the five thousand is not a spontaneous act but a deliberate demonstration of His power and provision. This event foreshadows the Last Supper and the spiritual nourishment Jesus provides through His sacrifice (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). It also connects to Old Testament themes of God providing manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), positioning Jesus as the fulfillment of God's promise to sustain His people. The phrase emphasizes that Jesus' miracles are signs pointing to His identity as the Messiah and the Son of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who poses the question to test Philip.

The test is not for Jesus to learn anything&#8212;He already knows. It is for the disciple to shift focus from human resources to the Lord who multiplies them. Each test we face carries the same invitation: recognize our limits, rely on Christ&#8217;s limitless power, and watch Him accomplish what He already intends to do.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And this he said to prove him.</span>--This gives us a glimpse into the educational method of the great Teacher. There is for Him no difficulty. He of Himself knows what He is about to do. But Philip had, we may think, been present at Cana of Galilee, and had seen the wine multiplied to supply the needs of all. Other signs had spoken to the eye, and a fuller teaching had spoken to the ear. How far had either spoken to the spirit? He had felt the Divine Presence in separate instances. Had he realised it as a law of life, holding for every need that could arise? The student has learnt individual facts, but has he laid hold of the principle which underlies them? The one is from without, and depends upon the teacher; the other is from within, and is the true education of the man himself. He has been taught; he is now to be examined.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This he said to test him;</span> but it is doubtful whether more is involved than an endeavour to entice from Philip the answer of faith, such <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, as "Lord, all things are possible to thee." Philip of Bethsaida was, moreover, in all probability, present at the wedding feast at Cans, and might have anticipated some such sign of the resources of his Lord. The other hints of Philip's character are severally consistent with this. Philip had said in the first instance to Nathanael, "Come and see." "Seeing is believing;" and Philip, on the night of the Passion, after much hearing and seeing of Jesus, said, "Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;" for he had even then not risen to the loftiness of the perception that the Father had been and was being revealed in Christ's own life (ch. 14.). Philip's personal acquaintance with the immediate vicinity is more likely to be the reason of his being put to this proof; while the tact of the inquiry as addressed to him is an undesigned note of the identity of the Johannine Christ with that portrayed by the synoptists. Bengel's suggestion, that Philip was entrusted with the commissariat of the twelve, is hardly consistent with the fact that Judas kept the common purse. We are expressly told that Jesus did not put the question in consequence of any deficiency of knowledge or resources on his own part, but to test the character and tone of Philip's mind. <span class="cmt_word">He himself knew what he was about to do.</span> Thus, by a slight touch, we see the blending of the distinctly human with the consciously Divine elements of that unique personality of his. There were to his Divine consciousness no gaps of reality, but he so threw himself into human conditions that he could ask the question and pass through the experience of a man. The whole <span class="accented">kenotic</span> controversy is, of course, involved in the solution of the problem offered by this verse. Perhaps no greater difficulty is involved in imagining the union of the Divine and human in one personality, in which at times the Ego is the Son of God and at other times purely the Son of man, than there is in the blending of the flesh and spirit in the Divine life of our own experience. John saw this, felt this, when the question was addressed to Philip. He saw by intuitive glance, as on so many other occasions, what Christ "knew" absolutely (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) or came to know by experience and observation (<a href="/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>; <a href="/john/16-19.htm">John 16:19</a>). The "trial," not the "temptation," of Philip was obvious in the form and tone of the question. The use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> shows that it frequently means "test," "prove," as well as "tempt." If God tempts, it is with the beneficent intention of encouraging the tempted one to succeed, to resist the allurement, to show and prove his power to bear a more serious assault. If the devil tempts (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), it is with the hope of inducing the sufferer to yield and fail. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He was asking</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
