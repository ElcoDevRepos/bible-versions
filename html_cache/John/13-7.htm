This setting is crucial as it marks the beginning of Jesus' final teachings before His crucifixion. The use of "replied" indicates a response to a question or confusion, highlighting the disciples' lack of understanding of Jesus' actions, specifically the washing of their feet, which was a task typically reserved for the lowest servant. This act of humility by Jesus sets the stage for His teaching on servanthood and leadership.<p><b>You do not realize now</b><br>The disciples often struggled to comprehend the full scope of Jesus' mission and teachings. This phrase underscores their current lack of understanding, which is a recurring theme throughout the Gospels. The immediate context involves Jesus performing an act that seems contradictory to their expectations of a Messiah. This moment reflects the broader theme of spiritual blindness and the need for divine revelation to truly grasp God's plans.<p><b>what I am doing</b><br>Jesus' actions here are symbolic and prophetic. The washing of the feet represents purification and service, foreshadowing His ultimate act of service on the cross. This act also serves as a model for the disciples, teaching them about humility and love. Theologically, it points to the cleansing from sin that Jesus provides, a concept further explored in passages like 1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>, which speaks of the blood of Jesus purifying believers from all sin.<p><b>but later you will understand</b><br>This promise of future understanding is fulfilled after Jesus' resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. The disciples' enlightenment is a key theme in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>, where Jesus promises that the Holy Spirit will teach them all things and remind them of everything He has said. This future understanding also connects to the broader narrative of God's redemptive plan, which unfolds progressively throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one speaking.

Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.">John 13:36</a>. The precise meaning is "after these things." The sense, then, is "What <span class= "ital">I</span> do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt come to know presently." (Comp. <a href="/john/13-17.htm" title="If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.">John 13:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said to him, That which I am doing thou knowest not now</span> - thou hast not absolute knowledge of, thou hast not seen through as yet; <span class="cmt_word">but after these things</span>, afterwards when I shall have completed my present undertaking, thou (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shalt</span> come by clear proof and full discovery and intimate acquaintance to <span class="cmt_word">understand</span>. This is sometimes referred to the subsequent illumination of the Holy Spirit, or even to the higher life of the future world (Luthardt), but the above interpretation is more consonant with the context. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> may (as Westcott suggests) point to the whole manifestation of love as it should complete itself on the cross, and become illumined by the Resurrection and by the gift of the Spirit, when the same mind should be put into Peter that was in Christ Jesus; consequently we may reasonably apply this great word to many of our earthly experiences. God's ways, Christ's government of his Church, and the mystery of our lot, are often so puzzling that we cannot be said to know them objectively or absolutely. We know (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) but in part, and see (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) by means of a mirror (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>); but eventually in the fulness of the Divine manifestation we shall know (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>) completely, subjectively, in the depths of our personal consciousness. <span class="cmt_word">Peter saith to him</span>, with mere emphasis than before, with an intensity of double negative and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not ever wash my feet</span> - "not while eternity lasts." "A praiseworthy modesty," says Calvin, "were it not that with God obedience is better than worship." This vehement, Peter-like burst showed that even yet he had not learned his profound dependence upon his Lord. Exuberant utterance of a love which in its superlative enthusiasm was in danger of severing the relation between his Lord and himself, elicited from Christ a reply which went far Beneath this purely symbolic washing, and gave even to it a moral significance which it had not possessed before. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, If I wash thee</span> (not thy feet) <span class="cmt_word">not, thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">no part with me</span> - no <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, no portion, no share, no communion, no common inheritance with me in the honors and blessings of the kingdom. This may be understood in two ways: either, "If I do not by my grace cleanse you from your defilement, wash you in a deeper sense, in a more abundant and effectual manner than by giving you this practical lesson, there is utter misunderstanding of my relation to you - you have no part nor share with me." And this ver. 11 seems to favor. Hengstenberg strongly defends this view as a reference by Christ to his power on earth to forgive sins, and confer the pure and new nature (cf. <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4, 9-11</a>); and this doubtless lies in the solemn tone of the Lord. A refusal to accept the Divine cleansing is the only ground of exclusion from the benefits of the bloodshedding. Still another more obvious meaning arises, "<span class="accented">If</span> you refuse this manifestation of humble love from me, if you put your own pride between yourself and me, if you disdain this act of self-surrender, claiming to understand me and our mutual relations better than I, you have no part with me. This is a symbol of my love to you, and of what is to be your love to one another (ver. 15); if you refuse to accept it from me, you will then have no part with me in the manifestation of the spirit of self-sacrificing love which I have come to inaugurate." Peter must learn the beauty and glory of service for the sake of others; and if he were unable to understand and accept this act of love, he must separate himself from all share in the Master's work. This truth dawned upon him, but only in part, and it led to the extraordinary revulsion of feeling which followed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(sy)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
