In the biblical context, love is often demonstrated through actions rather than words. The concept of "greater love" is rooted in the selfless, unconditional love that God shows humanity. This love is agape, a Greek term used in the New Testament to describe the highest form of love, which is selfless and sacrificial. The idea of "greater love" is also reflected in the Old Testament, where God&#8217;s covenantal love for Israel is portrayed as steadfast and enduring.<p><b>that he lay down his life</b><br>The act of laying down one's life is the ultimate expression of love and sacrifice. In the historical context of the Roman Empire, crucifixion was a common method of execution, reserved for the most serious offenses. Jesus' willingness to lay down His life is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who bears the sins of many. This phrase also connects to the typology of the sacrificial lamb in the Passover, where the lamb's blood spared the Israelites from death, prefiguring Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>for his friends.</b><br>The term "friends" signifies a close, personal relationship. In the cultural context of the time, friendship was a significant bond, often involving loyalty and mutual support. Jesus redefines friendship by including His disciples and, by extension, all believers. This is further illustrated in <a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>, where Jesus calls His disciples friends because He has shared with them everything He learned from the Father. The concept of friendship with God is also seen in the Old Testament, where figures like Abraham are called friends of God (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>). This phrase highlights the intimate relationship believers are invited into through Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples during the Last Supper, imparting final teachings before His crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' message, representing all believers who follow Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, a significant event where Jesus shares His final meal with His disciples before His arrest and crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrificial_love.htm">Understanding Sacrificial Love</a></b><br>Jesus defines the greatest form of love as self-sacrifice.

Nothing greater is conceivable in the thought of love. He has spoken of His own love for them as the measure of their love for each other. The thought of this verse dwells upon what His love really was and what theirs should also be. (Comp. especially Note on <a href="/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1John 3:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That a man lay down his life for his friends.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that any one . . .</span> For the phrase "lay down his life," comp. <a href="/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a>.

Such an interpretation supposes the lofty purpose of the greatest love. To me, however, it seems more probable that the translation given above places the argument upon a surer; because more common, human, experience. The disposition to die for ungodly and for enemies is exalted by St. Paul (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>) above the self-sacrifice involved in dying for the good. Still, which may be shown, and has often been shown in self-sacrificing death for those who are beloved, whatever other and wider ends may be discerned afterwards and spoken of in other connections, he is here asserting that the love of friendship is quite strong and intense enough to secure such a sacrifice.
