In the Jewish context, this refers to the Hebrew Scriptures, known as the Tanakh, which includes the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. The Pharisees and religious leaders of Jesus' time were known for their meticulous study of these texts. This phrase highlights their dedication to understanding God's word, yet it also implies a potential misdirection in their focus.<p><b>because you presume that by them you possess eternal life.</b><br>The presumption here is that the mere study and knowledge of the Scriptures could grant eternal life. This reflects a common belief among the Jewish leaders that adherence to the Law and the traditions could secure one's standing before God. However, Jesus challenges this notion by suggesting that the Scriptures themselves are not the source of life, but rather point to something greater. This echoes the theme found in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-20</a>, where life is found in choosing to love and obey God, not merely in the letter of the law.<p><b>These are the very words that testify about Me,</b><br>Jesus asserts that the Scriptures testify about Him, indicating that He is the fulfillment of the prophecies and promises contained within them. This is a profound claim, as it positions Jesus as the central figure of the biblical narrative. Passages such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> are often cited as prophetic references to the Messiah, which Jesus fulfills.

The problem is not the study itself, but what is missing from it.<p>&#8226; Even today, it is possible to attend every Bible study, fill notebooks with insights, and still miss the heart of what God is saying.

It is not a question of the form of the Greek word, for it may certainly be either. The English reader therefore is in a position to form his own opinion, and is in possession of almost all the evidence. He should observe that all the parallel verbs in the context are in the indicative--"Ye have neither heard" . . . "nor have seen" (<a href="/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>); "Ye have not His Word . . . ye believe not" (<a href="/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>); "Ye think that . . . ye have" (<a href="/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>); "Ye will not . . ye might have" (<a href="/john/5-40.htm" title="And you will not come to me, that you might have life.">John 5:40</a>). Why should there be a sudden change of construction in this instance only?<p>We find, then, this order of thought. (1) God has in the Old Testament witnessed of Me, but ye, with unreceptive hearts, have never heard a voice nor seen a shape of God (<a href="/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>). (2) Ye have not His word dwelling in you, or it would have witnessed of Me (<a href="/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>). (3) Instead of receiving the Scriptures as a living power within you, ye search and explain the letter of them from without (<a href="/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>). (4) <span class= "ital">Ye</span> think they contain eternal life, and hence your reverence for them (<a href="/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>). (5) They really are witnesses of Me, and yet you; seeking in them eternal life, are not willing to come to Me that ye may have this life. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 39, 40.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> <span class="accented">The witness of the Scriptures.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye search the Scriptures.</span> A large number of commentators, from Chrysostom and Augustine to Luther, Tholuck, Hengstenberg, M'Clellan, Luthardt, and Ewald, with the Authorized Version, regard this as an imperative command. This is grammatical, and corresponds to the language of <a href="/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; but with Cyril, Bengel, De Wette, Meyer, Godet, Lange, Westcott, Plummer, Watkins, we think the whole context demands the indicative. The second clause, "because in them," etc., follows far more obviously upon an assertion than upon a precept. The "ye will not" that follows is far more in harmony with the indicative than with the supposed command. The Lord says, "You have a third great testimony to my claim, and yet you are not prepared to accept it." <span class="accented">Ye search the Scriptures.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is used (<a href="/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>; <a href="/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) for minute, prolonged search. The kind of investigation which the rabbis spent upon the text and letter of the Holy Scriptures is a proverb, and led to the allegorical mystical meanings of the Genesisaras and other Hebrew literature. "Ye search the Scriptures" rather than the living Word, rather than the Divine meaning and message from the living God which they do contain. This is one term out of many which the Lord employed for the sacred literature which was the great heritage of the Hebrew people. Elsewhere he called it "the Law," "the Law and prophets," "Moses and the prophets," "your Law," "the wisdom of God." He admits their study, prolonged and eager, of the sacred writings, and he justifies the ground and motive of such search, viz.: <span class="cmt_word">because ye think in them ye have eternal life</span>; or, <span class="accented">ye shall have</span>, or <span class="accented">shall find, eternal life.</span> Some powerful critics, like Meyer, urge that our Lord agrees so far with the Jews, that he sympathizes with their search, and that censure or ironical language would be inconsistent with the Saviour's reverence for the Scriptures. But the expression is very unusual on that hypothesis, "Ye think [or, 'imagine'] ye have in them," rather than "ye have through them." Surely our Lord is here condemning the superstitious idea that, in the mere possession of the letter, they were possessors of the eternal life; that, apart from the indwelling Word, apart from the heart of the message itself, some magical advantage was springing. Hillel, whoso view of Scripture may be expressed in a saying ('Aboth,' 2:8), "He who has gotten to himself words of the Law hath gotten to himself the life of the world to come," here differs utterly from the Lord, who, on the doctrine of Holy Scripture, takes ground similar to that which he had taken with reference to the temple and the sabbath. It is not the bare possession of the Scriptures, nor the prolonged examination of its mere letter, that is the condition of eternal life. "Search" which is originated and stimulated by a vague idea of the life-giving force of the letter, is illusive. We may <span class="accented">think</span> that in them we have eternal life, but our Lord would undeceive us. Moreover, from the depths of his own consciousness and knowledge of his own mission, he adds: <span class="cmt_word">And they are they which testify concerning me.</span> This is one of the keynotes of New Testament teaching, viz. Christ's idea of the Old Testament, that it was a sketch or portraiture drawn in successive ages and on various material of himself - that it was an outline of great principles which he was about, <span class="accented">not</span> to rub out, but to fill in, not "to destroy, but to fulfil." The histories, the experiences, the ceremonial, the dynasties; the offices, the songs and prayers, the predictive and typical sorrows there depicted, were all prelibations and unconscious prophecies of himself. "They testify concerning me," and, together with my works and with my forerunner and, more than all, with my Father's own voice speaking and my Father's own face shining through all, they complete the manifold testimony to the fact that I have come to do his will, to work with him, to deliver, to restore, to give life, and to execute judgment also, when my hour is come.
