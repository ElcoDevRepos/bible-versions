The love of the Father for the Son is foundational to understanding the nature of the Trinity. This love is not only relational but also functional, as it underpins the mission of Jesus. In the context of the Gospel of John, this love is demonstrated through the sending of the Son into the world (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The love between the Father and the Son is also a model for the love believers are to have for one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<p><b>and has placed all things in His hands.</b><br>This phrase indicates the authority and sovereignty granted to Jesus by the Father. It reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's dominion (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7-8</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>). The phrase "all things" encompasses both the physical and spiritual realms, signifying that Jesus has ultimate authority over creation, judgment, and salvation. This authority is further affirmed in the Great Commission, where Jesus declares that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). The imagery of placing "all things in His hands" suggests trust and responsibility, highlighting Jesus' role as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, the first person of the Holy Trinity, who is the source of divine love and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the second person of the Holy Trinity, who is the recipient of the Father's love and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The context of this verse is part of John the Baptist's testimony about Jesus, emphasizing Jesus' divine authority and mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_love_and_authority.htm">Divine Love and Authority</a></b><br>The relationship between the Father and the Son is characterized by perfect love and trust.

We shall meet the words again in <a href="/john/5-20.htm" title="For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.">John 5:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35, 36.</span> - These fired verses certainly have the ring of the Gospel as a whole, and correspond with the fulness of Christological teaching, with which the words of Christ abound, as well as the Epistle of John; yet there is no exact parallel in the later revelation, From whom could such a statement come with greater power than from him who heard the Divine voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved Son: hear him"? The Berleb. Bible (quoted by Hengstenberg) adds, to the great words, <span class="cmt_word">the Father loveth the Son,</span> "as I sufficiently learned from the voice at the Jordan" - <span class="cmt_word">and hath given all things into his hand.</span> The "all things" may he taken by us in their widest sense (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>) - "all <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in heaven and earth" (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>); and the power of determining the final condition of all souls, suggested in ver. 36. But we may conceive a less extended horizon limiting the vision of the Baptist: all things belonging to the kingdom of God, to the progress and consummation of it in the world. John need not be supposed to have swept onward into the eternal future, but mainly to have been thinking of the mutual relations of the forerunner and the Christ. The Son will determine the place of his herald and of his disciple. There is no limit expressed. He who had these matters entrusted to him might easily be supposed to have "all things in his hand." He rested the less upon the greater. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
