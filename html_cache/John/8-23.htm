This interaction takes place during the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival. Jesus often used these moments to reveal deeper spiritual truths. His teachings frequently challenged the religious leaders, who were often more concerned with legalistic traditions than with understanding the heart of God's message.<p><b>&#8220;You are from below;</b><br>Here, "below" refers to the earthly, human perspective that the Pharisees held. It signifies a mindset focused on worldly matters, human traditions, and the physical realm. This phrase highlights the contrast between human limitations and divine understanding. The Pharisees' inability to recognize Jesus as the Messiah stems from their earthly perspective.<p><b>I am from above.</b><br>Jesus asserts His divine origin, emphasizing His heavenly authority and mission. This statement aligns with the prologue of John's Gospel, where Jesus is described as the Word who was with God and was God (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>). It underscores His pre-existence and divine nature, setting Him apart from all humanity. This claim of being "from above" is a direct assertion of His deity.<p><b>You are of this world;</b><br>The term "this world" refers to the fallen, sinful state of humanity and the systems opposed to God's kingdom. The Pharisees, despite their religious status, are depicted as being entrenched in worldly values and unable to comprehend spiritual truths. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the world being in opposition to God's purposes (1 <a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15-17</a>).<p><b>I am not of this world.</b><br>Jesus distinguishes Himself from the worldly systems and values. His mission is not rooted in earthly power or authority but in fulfilling the divine plan of salvation. This statement foreshadows His later prayer in <a href="/john/17-16.htm">John 17:16</a>, where He declares that His followers are also not of the world, just as He is not. It emphasizes the call for believers to live according to heavenly principles, distinct from worldly influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees and the people, making a distinction between His divine origin and their earthly nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A group of Jewish religious leaders who often opposed Jesus and His teachings.

By exposing the gulf between &#8220;below&#8221; and &#8220;above,&#8221; Jesus calls each listener to recognize personal need and trust the One who came down to lift us up.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) There is indeed a gulf which they cannot pass, but it is not that between souls in Abraham's bosom and souls in Hades. It is the gulf between heaven and earth. This He brings out in two pairs of antithetic clauses. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a>.) These clauses interpret each other, and no deeper meaning is to be given to the first pair than is borne by the second. We may arrange them in a pair of affirmatives and a pair of negatives--<p>"Ye are from beneath;" "ye are of this world."<p>"I am from above" (not from beneath); "I am not of this world."<p>We have thus the full Hebrew expression of one thought, and this is the thought which John the Baptist, from another point of view, taught his disciples in <a href="/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>. They are by origin and nature of the earth. He was by origin and nature from heaven. Of the earth, their feelings and thoughts and life were of the earth, and, by devotion to things of the earth, they are destroying the spirit made in the image of God, which is within them, and the link between them and heaven. He is from heaven in origin, and is divine in nature. He has come to reveal the heavenly and the divine to the earthly and the human. In Him, and in Him only, can their spirits find deliverance from sin, and find the true life; for in Him, and in Him only, the divine and the human meet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - Yet this essential divergence is not based on fatalistic grounds, but on moral ones. The argument of the twenty-fourth verse explains the description of ver. 23. The ground of this utter alienation is the lack of belief, which will leave them in their sins to die. <span class="cmt_word">He said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above.</span> You spring from the lower as opposed to the higher world; you are influenced by considerations drawn from the earthly, sensual, superficial, and transitory. It is not necessary to suppose that our Lord is clenching the Jews' harsh speech about the underworld with a <span class="accented">tu-quoque</span>, as though they verily belonged to the Gehenna to which they were consigning him; for the next pair of clauses are in parallel apposition with the former. In the words, <span class="cmt_word">Ye are of this world; I am not of this world,</span> "This world" corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> of the previous clause, and the "not of this world" corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, the heavenly regions from which he has continually declared, in many varieties of phrase, that he had come, or descended, or been sent. Certainly and broadly speaking, this is true, as a contrast between Christ and all other men before their regeneration. Our Lord especially charges home upon these earth-bound souls, on these purely human, selfish, unspiritual, unrenewed, unbelieving men, this antagonism to himself, this refusal to walk in his light or receive his life. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" (<a href="/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>). They are flesh. He does not exclude them forever from such participation in his own heavenly life as would reverse the descriptive and characteristic features of their being. The reason why they have not seen the kingdom or the King is that they are not born of the Spirit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
