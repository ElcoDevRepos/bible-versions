It reflects the concept of the Incarnation, where Jesus, though divine, entered the human realm to fulfill God's redemptive plan. This mission is rooted in Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of the anointed one sent to bring good news. The sending of Jesus is a central theme in the Gospel of John, emphasizing His role as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and the Savior (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-17</a>). The world, in this context, refers to humanity in its fallen state, in need of salvation.<p><b>I have also sent them into the world</b><br>Here, Jesus commissions His disciples, paralleling His own mission. This sending is not just geographical but spiritual, as they are to carry the message of the Gospel to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The disciples are to be ambassadors of Christ, representing Him and His teachings. This commission is empowered by the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where the disciples receive power to be witnesses. The phrase underscores the continuity of Jesus' mission through His followers, establishing the foundation for the Church's evangelistic efforts. The world remains the sphere of their mission, indicating the ongoing need for the Gospel in a world resistant to divine truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is praying to God the Father.
