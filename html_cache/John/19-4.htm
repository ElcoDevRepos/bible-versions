Pilate's repeated actions suggest his reluctance and the pressure he faced from the Jewish leaders.<p><b>and said to the Jews,</b><br>The term "Jews" here refers primarily to the Jewish religious leaders and those who were instigating the call for Jesus' crucifixion.

Each phrase builds the case: repeated appearances reveal Pilate&#8217;s reluctance; the address to the Jews highlights national accountability; the invitation &#8220;Look&#8221; becomes a providential call to behold the true King; the presentation of a wounded but guiltless Christ anticipates His sacrificial death; and the formal declaration of &#8220;no basis for a charge&#8221; seals the testimony of His sinlessness. Together, the verse magnifies God&#8217;s sovereign plan: the spotless Lamb, openly declared innocent, will willingly bear the world&#8217;s guilt so that all who truly &#8220;look&#8221; to Him might be saved.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Pilate therefore went forth again.</span>--He had returned to the palace, and had ordered the scourging in the courtyard (<a href="/context/mark/15-15.htm" title="And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.">Mark 15:15-16</a>).

Had he found proof of a legal crime he would have ordered His execution, and not have led Him forth in this mock royal attitude to move the feelings of the people.<p>(4) That the third, sixth, and ninth hours (comp. <a href="/matthew/20-3.htm" title="And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,">Matthew 20:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-5.htm" title="Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.">Matthew 20:5</a>) seem to have been, in common life, rough divisions of the day, corresponding to the watches of the night. An event occurring at ten o'clock might have been spoken of roughly as about the third hour, while it might, on the other hand, be thought of as within the division called the sixth hour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span> - (e) [Without the Praetorium.] Further protestations by Pilate of Christ's innocence bring out the hitherto-concealed Jewish verdict that he had claimed to be the Son of God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pilate</span>, with grim insouciance, allows the mockery to take place, and then, with his poor derided sham-king at his side, he <span class="cmt_word">went forth again</span> from the Praetorium to the public seat, where he kept up the conflict with the accusers and the ever-gathering crowd, <span class="cmt_word">and saith to them</span>, with more of passion than before, imagining that this pitiable caricature of a king would reduce the cry of "Crucify him!" into some more moderate and less preposterous demand. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I lead him forth to you</span>, crowned, but bleeding, robed as a king, but humiliated to a condition worse than a slave, that <span class="cmt_word">ye may know that I find no crime</span> <span class="cmt_word">in him</span>; literally, no charge; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no "crime." Pilate rims renews and varies his testimony to the character of the Holy One! He makes another fruitless appeal to the humanity and justice of the maddened mob. But what a revelation of Pilate's own weakness and shame! He can find no fault, but has connived at, nay, ordered, the worst part of this atrocious punishment. Keim would have us think that Pilate's anxiety to save a Jew is a mere invention made by the second-century fabricator. There is however, nothing incompatible with a Roman official's anxiety not to commit a judicial murder, for his own sake, and perhaps for the honor of his order. The hypothesis is irrational that the entire representation of Pilate's desire to screen or save Jesus from the malice of the Jews was a device of the author, due to his Gentile nationality and proclivities, anxious to put even the Roman officials in the best possible light. Surely Christians had no temptation to mitigate their judgments upon Rome at the time of the persecution under Marcus Antoninus. Thoma, like Strauss, finds the basis of the representation in the prophetic types of <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Once]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">again</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(palin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3825.htm">Strong's 3825: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from the same as pale; anew, i.e. back, once more, or furthermore or on the other hand.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pilate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#953;&#955;&#8118;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pilatos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4091.htm">Strong's 4091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pilate.
