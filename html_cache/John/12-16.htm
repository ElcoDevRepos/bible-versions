This lack of understanding is seen throughout the Gospels, as they grapple with the concept of a suffering Messiah (<a href="/mark/9-32.htm">Mark 9:32</a>). The Jewish expectation was for a conquering king, not a suffering servant, which contributed to their confusion. This phrase highlights the human tendency to misunderstand divine plans without spiritual insight.<p><b>but after Jesus was glorified</b><br>The glorification of Jesus refers to His death, resurrection, and ascension. It was only after these events that the disciples received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>), which enlightened their understanding. This transformation is crucial, as it marks the transition from confusion to clarity, enabling them to fulfill the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>they remembered what had been done to Him</b><br>The disciples' recollection of events is significant, as it underscores the importance of memory in the formation of the Gospel accounts. The Holy Spirit played a role in helping them remember and interpret these events correctly (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>). This remembrance was not just intellectual but also spiritual, allowing them to see the fulfillment of prophecy and the purpose behind Jesus' actions.<p><b>and they realized that these very things had also been written about Him</b><br>This realization points to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. Scriptures such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> foreshadow the suffering and triumph of Jesus. The disciples' understanding of these prophecies was deepened post-resurrection, as they saw Jesus as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44-45</a>).
