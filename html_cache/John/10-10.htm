In the context of <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, the "thief" can be understood as false teachers or leaders who exploit the flock for personal gain. Historically, Israel had experienced leaders who led them astray, as seen in the warnings of the prophets (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>). The imagery of a thief aligns with the cultural understanding of shepherding in ancient Palestine, where shepherds had to protect their flocks from thieves and predators. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of spiritual warfare, where Satan is described as a thief who seeks to devour (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>I have come that they may have life,</b><br>Jesus' mission is presented as the antithesis of the thief's destructive intent. The "life" mentioned here is not merely physical existence but encompasses spiritual vitality and eternal life. This concept is central to the Gospel of John, where Jesus is repeatedly identified as the source of life (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 14</a>:6). The promise of life is rooted in the Old Testament, where God is depicted as the giver of life (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>). Jesus fulfills the prophetic expectation of a shepherd who truly cares for and sustains His flock (Psalm 23).<p><b>and have it in all its fullness.</b><br>The phrase "in all its fullness" suggests abundance and completeness, indicating that the life Jesus offers is rich and satisfying. This fullness is not limited to material prosperity but includes spiritual blessings and a deep relationship with God. The idea of abundant life resonates with the promises of the Old Testament, where God assures His people of blessings when they follow His ways (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). In the New Testament, this fullness is further explained as the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, who empowers believers to live fruitful lives (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).

Staying close to the Shepherd shields us from the thief and keeps us walking in the fullness only Christ can provide.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">The thief cometh not, but for to steal.</span>--Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1</a>; <a href="/john/10-8.htm" title="All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.">John 10:8</a>. The description of the thief is opposed to that of the shepherd, who constantly goes in and out and finds pasture. His visits are but rare, and when he comes it is but for his own selfish purposes, and for the ruin of the flock. Each detail of his cruel work is dwelt upon, to bring out in all the baseness of its extent the corresponding spiritual truth.<p><span class= "bld">I am come that they might have life.</span>--More exactly, <span class= "ital">I came that they might have life.</span> The pronoun should be emphasised. <span class= "ital">I</span> came, as opposed to the thief. He does not further dwell upon the shepherd, but passes on to the thought of Himself, and thereby prepares the way for the thought of Himself as the Good Shepherd in the following verse. The object of His coming is the direct opposite of that of the thief, who comes only to steal and to kill and to destroy. He came once for all, that in Him the sheep may have life. (Comp. <a href="/context/john/6-50.htm" title="This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.">John 6:50-51</a>.) The Sinaitic MS. inserts the word "eternal" here--"that they might have life eternal." The word is probably not part of the original text, and the thought is rather of the present spiritual life which every believer now hath, and which will issue in eternal life. But comp. Note on <a href="/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And that they might have it more abundantly.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and that they might have it abundantly.</span> The word "more" is an insertion of the English version without any authority, and it weakens the sense. It is not that a greater is compared with a less abundance, but that the abundance of life which results through Christ's coming is contrasted with the spiritual wants and death which He came to remove. This life is through Him given to men abundantly, overflowingly. We are reminded of the Shepherd-King's Psalm singing of the "green pastures," and "waters of rest," and "prepared table," and "overflowing cup"; and carrying all this into the region of the spiritual life we come again to the opening words of this Gospel, "And of His fulness did we all receive, and grace for grace" . . . "grace and truth came by Jesus Christ" (<a href="/context/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16-17</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy.</span> Christ, elaborating, evolving, what is contained in the image of "thief," regards his rival as the thief of souls; he whose pretension to be a way to God is based on no inward and eternal reality, who comes for no other purpose than to make the sheep his own, not to give them pasture; to sacrifice them to his selfish ends, to use them for his own purposes, not to deal with them graciously for theirs; but to destroy, since in the pursuit of his selfish ends he wastes both life and pasture. A terrible impeachment, this of all who have not recognized the true Door into the sheepfold, who would shut up the way of life that they may exalt their own order, would diminish the chances of souls in order to secure their own position. This forms the transition to the second interpretation of the parabolic words; for he adds, <span class="cmt_word">I came that they might have life, and that they might have it abundantly</span>; more even than they can possibly use. This is one of the grandest of our Lord's claims. He gives like God from overflowing stores (<a href="/titus/3-6.htm">Titus 3:6</a>). Those who receive life from him have within them perennial sources of life for others - fullness of being (see notes, <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>; <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). One of the differentiae of "life" is "abundance" of supply beyond immediate possibility of use. Life has the future in its arms. Life propagates new life. Life has untold capacities about it - beauty, fragrance, strength, growth, variety, reproduction, resistance to death, continuity, eternity.
