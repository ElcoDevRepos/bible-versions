The imagery of a gate or door is significant in the context of ancient Near Eastern shepherding practices, where a shepherd would often serve as the literal gate to a sheepfold, lying across the entrance to protect the sheep. This metaphor emphasizes Jesus' role as the protector and mediator between God and humanity. The concept of Jesus as the sole entry point aligns with His other "I am" statements, such as "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), underscoring His unique and divine authority.<p><b>If anyone enters through Me,</b><br>This phrase highlights the inclusivity of the offer of salvation, available to "anyone" who chooses to enter through Jesus. It reflects the universal call of the Gospel, transcending ethnic, cultural, and social boundaries. The act of entering "through Me" signifies faith in Jesus as the Messiah and acceptance of His redemptive work. This echoes the invitation found in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, "Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."<p><b>he will be saved.</b><br>The promise of salvation is central to the Christian faith, encompassing deliverance from sin and its consequences, including eternal separation from God. This assurance of salvation is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>, "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." The certainty of salvation through Jesus alone is a cornerstone of Christian doctrine.<p><b>He will come in and go out</b><br>This phrase suggests freedom and security for those who are in Christ. In the context of shepherding, sheep that can "come in and go out" are under the care of a trustworthy shepherd, free from fear of predators or thieves. Spiritually, this represents the believer's liberty in Christ, as well as the assurance of His constant presence and protection. It reflects the peace and confidence found in <a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>, "The LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore."<p><b>and find pasture.</b><br>Finding pasture symbolizes provision, sustenance, and spiritual nourishment. In the agrarian society of biblical times, green pastures were essential for the well-being of sheep, representing abundance and care. Spiritually, this imagery points to the fulfillment and satisfaction found in a relationship with Christ, as He provides for the needs of His followers. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>, "The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures." Jesus, as the Good Shepherd, ensures that His flock is well-fed and cared for, both physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, identifying Himself as "the gate," emphasizing His role as the sole means of salvation and access to spiritual nourishment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep.htm">The Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolic of believers who follow Jesus, entering through Him to receive salvation and sustenance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gate.htm">The Gate</a></b><br>A metaphor for Jesus, illustrating His function as the entry point to salvation and the Kingdom of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pasture.htm">Pasture</a></b><br>Represents spiritual nourishment, safety, and the abundant life that Jesus provides to those who follow Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fold.htm">The Fold</a></b><br>The community of believers, the Church, where safety and fellowship are found through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_as_the_exclusive_path_to_salvation.htm">Jesus as the Exclusive Path to Salvation</a></b><br>Emphasize the exclusivity of Christ as the only way to salvation, rejecting any notion of multiple paths to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/security_and_freedom_in_christ.htm">Security and Freedom in Christ</a></b><br>Believers find true freedom and security in Jesus, able to "come in and go out" without fear, knowing they are under His protection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_nourishment_and_growth.htm">Spiritual Nourishment and Growth</a></b><br>Just as sheep find pasture, believers find spiritual nourishment and growth through a relationship with Christ and His Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_church_community.htm">The Role of the Church Community</a></b><br>The fold represents the Church, where believers gather for mutual support, teaching, and encouragement in their walk with Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_the_abundant_life.htm">Living the Abundant Life</a></b><br>Jesus promises an abundant life, not in material wealth, but in spiritual richness, peace, and fulfillment found in Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_10_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 10:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_10_9_Jesus_as_today_s_salvation_gate.htm">How does John 10:9 illustrate Jesus as the "gate" for salvation today?
