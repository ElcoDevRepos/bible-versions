In the context of <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, Jesus is speaking to the Samaritan woman at the well, contrasting the physical locations of worship (Mount Gerizim for Samaritans and Jerusalem for Jews) with the spiritual nature of true worship. The concept of God as Spirit aligns with Old Testament teachings, such as in <a href="/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>, where the distinction between the spiritual and the physical is made. This understanding of God as Spirit also connects to the creation narrative in Genesis, where God breathes life into humanity, indicating a spiritual essence.<p><b>and His worshipers must worship Him</b><br>The necessity of worshiping God is a central theme throughout the Bible. Worship is not merely a ritualistic practice but a fundamental response to God's nature and actions. In the historical context, both Jews and Samaritans had specific locations and rituals for worship, but Jesus is pointing to a deeper, more personal form of worship. This phrase underscores the idea that worship is not confined to a place or a set of actions but is a requirement for those who follow God.<p><b>in spirit</b><br>Worshiping in spirit means engaging with God on a spiritual level, beyond physical rituals and locations. This reflects the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>, where the Spirit of God dwells within. The emphasis on spirit also connects to the prophecy in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people. This spiritual worship is a fulfillment of the new covenant, where the law is written on hearts rather than tablets of stone.<p><b>and in truth.</b><br>Worshiping in truth involves sincerity and alignment with God's revealed Word. Truth is a recurring theme in John's Gospel, with Jesus Himself declaring, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This phrase calls for worship that is genuine and based on the truth of who God is, as revealed through Jesus Christ. The connection to truth also ties back to the Old Testament, where truth is associated with God's faithfulness and covenant promises, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a>. Worship in truth requires a commitment to living according to God's Word and acknowledging Jesus as the ultimate revelation of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the Samaritan woman at the well, revealing profound truths about worship and the nature of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_woman.htm">Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>A key figure in this account, she engages in a theological discussion with Jesus, leading to a revelation about true worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob's_well.htm">Jacob's Well</a></b><br>The setting of this encounter, located in Samaria, symbolizes a place of historical and spiritual significance, bridging Jewish and Samaritan traditions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The region where this event takes place, highlighting the cultural and religious tensions between Jews and Samaritans.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_gerizim.htm">Mount Gerizim</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in the conversation, it represents the Samaritan place of worship, contrasting with the Jewish focus on Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_nature.htm">Understanding God's Nature</a></b><br>Recognize that God is Spirit, which transcends physical limitations and requires a spiritual approach to worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/true_worship_defined.htm">True Worship Defined</a></b><br>Worship must be conducted in spirit and truth, meaning it should be genuine, heartfelt, and aligned with God's revealed truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_and_religious_barriers.htm">Cultural and Religious Barriers</a></b><br>Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman shows that true worship transcends cultural and religious boundaries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection.htm">Personal Reflection</a></b><br>Evaluate your own worship practices to ensure they are sincere and based on biblical truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_worship.htm">Living Worship</a></b><br>Worship is not confined to a location or ritual but is a lifestyle of honoring God in all aspects of life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_4_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 4:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/What_is_God_s_nature_in_John_4_24.htm">How does John 4:24 define the nature of God as "spirit"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_worshiping_God_in_spirit.htm">What does it mean to worship God "in spirit and truth"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Align_worship_with_John_4_24.htm">How can we ensure our worship aligns with John 4:24's teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/John_4_24_s_link_to_true_worship_in_Bible.htm">How does John 4:24 connect with other scriptures about true worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_deepen_spiritual_worship.htm">What practical steps can deepen our spiritual worship as described in John 4:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_God_is_Spirit_in_John_4_24.htm">What does "God is Spirit" mean in John 4:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_defines_true_worship_in_John_4_24.htm">How does John 4:24 define true worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_worship_in_spirit_and_truth.htm">Why must worship be in spirit and truth according to John 4:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_evolution_link_god_belief_to_survival.htm">How do evolutionary psychology studies show that belief in God is a byproduct of survival instincts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_god_considered_male_or_female.htm">Is God considered male or female?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_spiritual_presence.htm">What defines spiritual presence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_spiritualism.htm">What defines spiritualism?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 4:24 Mean</div><b>God is Spirit</b><p>&#8226;

Because God is Spirit, His people&#8212;made alive by the Spirit&#8212;must worship from the depths of their being, anchored in the truth of His Word and the person of Christ. Spirit and truth are not two options but two inseparable strands of genuine worship, calling every believer to heartfelt, biblically grounded adoration wherever we are.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">God is a Spirit.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">God is spirit.</span> His will has been expressed in the seeking. But His very nature and essence is spirit, and it follows from this that all true worship must be spiritual. The appeal is here made to a doctrine of special prominence in the Samaritan theology. They had altered a number of passages in the Pentateuch, which seemed to them to speak of God in language properly applicable to man, and to ascribe to Him human form and feelings. But to believe in the spiritual essence of God contained its own answer both as to place and mode of worship.<p>The second "Him" ("they that worship Him") should be omitted, as the italics show.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - A still more explicit and comprehensive reason is given for the previous assertion, based on the essential nature of God himself in the fulness of his eternal Being. <span class="cmt_word">God is Spirit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; cf. <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, - the article indicates the subject, and the predicate is here generic, and not an indefinite; therefore we do not render it, "God is a Spirit"). The most comprehensive and far-reaching metaphor or method by which Jesus endeavoured to portray the fundamental essence of the Divine Being is "Spirit," not body, not <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but that deep inner verity presented in self-conscious ego; the <span class="accented">substantia</span> of which mind may be predicated, and all its states and faculties. The Father <span class="accented">is</span> Spirit, the Son is Spirit, and Spirit is the unity of the Father and the Son. St. John has recorded elsewhere that "God is Light," and "God is Love." These three Divine utterances are the sublimest ever formed to express the metaphysical, intellectual, and moral essence of the Deity. They are unfathomably deep, and quite inexhaustible in their suggestions, and yet they are not too profound for even a little child or a poor Samaritaness to grasp for practical purposes. If God be Spirit, <span class="cmt_word">then they who worship him,</span> the Spirit, <span class="cmt_word">must</span> by the nature of the case, <span class="accented">must</span> by the force of a Divine arrangement, <span class="cmt_word">worship him,</span> if they worship him at all, <span class="cmt_word">in spirit and in truth.</span> The truth which our Lord uttered was not unknown in the Old Testament. From Genesis to Malachi, in the Psalms, in the historical books, in Judges, Samuel, and Kings, the Spirit and the spirituality of God are presupposed; but the Lord has generalized these teachings, cited them from darkness and neglect, combined them in one eternal oracle of Divine truth. The Galilaean Peasant has thus uttered the profoundest truth of ethic and religion - one which no sage in East or West had ever surpassed, and towards which the highest minds in all the ages of Christendom have been slowly making approach. Forms, postures, ceremonial, sacraments, liturgies, holy days, and places are not condemned, but they all are inefficacious if this prime condition be not present, and they can all be dispensed with if it be. Only the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of man can really touch or commune with the Spirit of spirits, and the history of the new dispensation is the history of a progress from forms to realities, from the sensuous to the spiritual, from the outward to the inward, from the earthly to the heavenly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">God [is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#972;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Spirit,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Pneuma)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4151.htm">Strong's 4151: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wind, breath, spirit. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[His]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
