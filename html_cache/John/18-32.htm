Jesus had previously spoken about His death in passages such as <a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32-33</a>, where He indicated that He would be "lifted up" from the earth, signifying crucifixion. This fulfillment underscores the divine plan and foreknowledge of God, as well as Jesus' role as the Messiah who fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant.<p><b>to indicate the kind of death</b><br>The "kind of death" refers specifically to crucifixion, a Roman method of execution that was not a Jewish practice. This detail is significant because it aligns with Jesus' earlier predictions and the Roman involvement in His death, as seen in the collaboration between Jewish leaders and Roman authorities. The method of crucifixion is also significant in its symbolism, as it was a form of execution reserved for the most serious criminals, highlighting the depth of Jesus' humiliation and suffering.<p><b>He was going to die</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the certainty and purpose of Jesus' death. It was not a random or unforeseen event but a predetermined part of God's redemptive plan. Jesus' death is central to Christian theology, as it provides the means for atonement and reconciliation between God and humanity.

Earlier, Jesus had insisted that &#8220;the Scriptures must be fulfilled&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-54.htm">Matthew 26:54</a>).

Yet prophecy required a different death:<p>- Hands and feet pierced (<a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>).<p>- A body &#8220;hung on a tree,&#8221; bearing the curse for us (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p>- Bones unbroken (<a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a>; <a href="/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>).<p>Roman crucifixion fulfilled every detail.

In the synoptists he is said to have repeatedly spoken of his <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/luke/14-27.htm">Luke 14:27</a>; <a href="/mark/8-34.htm">Mark 8:34</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>); but in <a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a> he had clearly predicted his crucifixion by the Gentiles (cf. <a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22, 23</a>). The manner or kind of death was full of significance; it provided opportunity for the royal demission of his own life; it gave conditions for much of the sublime self-manifestation of the closing hours; it has proved, notwithstanding all the shame and curse of the proceeding, eminently symbolic of the compassion with which he embraced the human race in all its defilement and all the variety of its need. We are not surprised to find that the evangelist saw, in the complicated relations of Jewish and Roman authority, a divinely ordered arrangement, and a clearly foreseen and predicted consummation. <a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a> shows that the charge brought against Jesus was made to receive a coloring likely to prejudice the Roman governor against him: "We found this Man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King." The uproar and the false and malicious charge would be more likely than any other to move Pilate against him; and thus the synoptic narrative, being presupposed, gives an explanation of the first question which John, as well as the synoptists, represents Pilate as first of all pressing upon the Divine Sufferer. Without Luke's statement, Pilate's question is abrupt and in. explicable; but it must be admitted that there is in John's narrative no direct hint of Luke's addition; and Christ's counter-question to the inquiry of Pilate (which last is given in the same form by all four evangelists) implies that he had not overheard the false charge which the Jews had brought into the court. The Lord was within the Praetorium. Pilate and the Jews were on the open, external space, where the altercation proceeded. We may also, with Steinmeyer, observe that nothing could appear more anomalous to Pilate than that these bigoted and rebellious priests, who perpetually resisted the claims of Roman governors to enforce tribute, should now hypocritically pretend that a prophet-leader of their own had been guilty of such a charge. Instead of resisting, the Pharisees would have fostered a demagogue who had taken such a disloyal part. Pilate would at once have suspected that there was something ominous in the very charge itself, when tumultuously pressed by a party who were accustomed to regard such proceedings as patriotic; and he saw with shrewdness that the Jews had merely cloaked their real antagonism by presenting an incrimination which, under ordinary circumstances, they would have treated as a crowning virtue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
