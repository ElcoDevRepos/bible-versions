As a teacher of Israel, Nicodemus would have been well-versed in the Hebrew Scriptures, including the Law and the Prophets. His role would have involved interpreting the Scriptures and teaching them to the people. This highlights the expectation that he should have a deep understanding of spiritual matters. The title "teacher" suggests a position of authority and respect within Jewish society, emphasizing the responsibility to guide others in spiritual truths.<p><b>said Jesus,</b><br>Jesus, addressing Nicodemus directly, emphasizes His role as a teacher and prophet, often challenging the established religious norms. Jesus frequently engaged with religious leaders, offering new insights into the Scriptures and the Kingdom of God. His teachings often fulfilled Old Testament prophecies and revealed deeper spiritual truths. Jesus' authority in teaching is recognized throughout the Gospels, as He often spoke with wisdom and understanding that surpassed that of the religious leaders of His time.<p><b>and you do not understand these things?</b><br>This question underscores the disconnect between Nicodemus's knowledge of the Scriptures and his understanding of spiritual truths. "These things" refer to the concepts Jesus had been discussing, such as being "born again" and the work of the Spirit. The expectation was that a teacher of Israel should comprehend these spiritual realities, as they are rooted in the Old Testament. For example, passages like <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a> speak of a new heart and spirit, which align with the concept of spiritual rebirth.

Jesus reminds a nationally recognized teacher that Scripture&#8217;s promises demand a heart changed by the Spirit, not mere scholarly acclaim. Privilege calls for deeper understanding; authority means accountability. In asking, &#8220;You are Israel&#8217;s teacher &#8230; and you do not understand?&#8221; Jesus lovingly confronts all who know the text yet miss its life-giving center&#8212;new birth through Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Art thou a master of Israel</span>?--Better, <span class= "ital">Art thou the teacher of Israel?</span> The article is emphatic, and points to the position of Nicodemus as a teacher of repute--"the well-known teacher;" or possibly it is to be understood of the Sanhedrin as represented by him--"Is this the teaching of Israel?" There is something of just indignation here, as everywhere when the words of Jesus Christ are addressed to the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. "You who teach others, have you need to learn the very first lessons of true religion? You who claim to loose and bind men, and place heavy burdens on them which they cannot bear, are you without the simplest real knowledge of what God is, or of what man is? Do teachers of Israel know not these things when they lie beneath every page of the Old Testament Scriptures?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and perceivest thou not these things?</span> The term "Israel" is used four times by John (<a href="/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31, 49</a>; <a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>; and here). In each place the high dignity, calling, and glory of the nation chosen for the loftiest privilege and destiny are involved. Notice the article, "the Israel" of God. The article before <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> gives a high distinction to Nicodemus. Schottgen and Lucke suppose some special office to be here referred to, either the president of the Sanhedrin, or the <span class="accented">hakim</span>, or <span class="accented">chakam</span>, "the wise man," who sat on his left in the public sessions, or the "father of the house of judgment," who sat on his right; but it may simply mean the teacher of Israel, who has come to me in representative fashion, and who is reminded that he should have been more intimately acquainted with the teaching of his own sacred books (Farrar, 'Life of Christ,' p. 153). Without doubt, the fact of human corruption, and the power of the Spirit of God to renovate, to change utterly down to the very core and heart of human nature, is a great dogma of the Old Testament (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-9.htm">1 Samuel 10:9</a>, where God gave Saul another heart; <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, the effect upon David; David's own prayer, <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>; and the great promises of God by <a href="/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). Nicodemus, an illustrious man, a teacher of ethers, presumably acquainted with the teaching of the Scriptures, need not have been in such doubt and amazement at the searching words of Jesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(Sy)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
