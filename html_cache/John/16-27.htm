In the context of the Gospel of John, this love is not abstract but deeply relational, reflecting the intimate relationship between God and His children. The Father&#8217;s love is foundational to the Christian faith, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God&#8217;s love for the world is demonstrated through the giving of His Son. This love is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>, where God declares His everlasting love for His people. The use of "Himself" underscores the personal nature of this love, distinguishing it from a mediated or distant affection.<p><b>because you have loved Me</b><br>The love for Jesus is a response to the revelation of who He is&#8212;the Messiah and the Son of God. This love is not merely emotional but is demonstrated through obedience and commitment to His teachings, as seen in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments." The disciples' love for Jesus is a reflection of their understanding and acceptance of His divine mission. In the cultural context of the time, love was often expressed through loyalty and allegiance, which the disciples showed by following Jesus despite societal and religious opposition.<p><b>and have believed that I came from God</b><br>Belief in Jesus' divine origin is central to the Christian faith. This phrase affirms the disciples' recognition of Jesus as the one sent by God, fulfilling the messianic prophecies of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which speaks of a child born who will be called "Mighty God." The acknowledgment of Jesus' divine mission is crucial, as it distinguishes true disciples from those who merely see Him as a prophet or teacher. This belief is also a key theme in the Gospel of John, where Jesus' identity and mission are repeatedly affirmed, as in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us." The historical context of this belief was radical, as it challenged the prevailing Jewish expectations of the Messiah and the nature of God&#8217;s intervention in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, who is the source of divine love and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son of God, who is speaking to His disciples, emphasizing the relationship between the Father, Himself, and the believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who love Jesus and believe in His divine origin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coming_of_jesus.htm">The Coming of Jesus</a></b><br>The event of Jesus coming from God, highlighting His divine mission and incarnation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_love_of_god.htm">The Love of God</a></b><br>The overarching theme of this passage, focusing on the personal and relational love God has for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_love.htm">Understanding Divine Love</a></b><br>Recognize that God's love is personal and relational, not just a general concept.

Love for Christ and faith in His divine mission open the door to the very heart of God, inviting every believer into the same confident security.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me.</span>--Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a>; <a href="/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>. The introduction of the thought again here reminds us that, although in the fulness of the higher spiritual life there is communion between the Father and the human spirit, because the Father Himself ever loveth the heart which can receive His love, this power to receive the love of the Father is itself the result of loving the Son, who has revealed Him. Our Lord is leading them to the fuller truths of spiritual communion with God, and even tells them that this will be independent of mediation; but the very words which tell them that it will be independent of mediation, tell them that all depends upon His own mediation and the manifestation of the love of God in His own person.<p><span class= "bld">And have believed that I came out from God.</span>--The reading is uncertain. Several of the better MSS. read, ". . . that I came forth from the Father." (Comp. the first words of the next verse and <a href="/john/13-3.htm" title="Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;">John 13:3</a>.) The perfect tenses represent their love and faith as completed, and continuing in the present. It is striking that the order of the words makes faith' follow love. This order may be chosen to mark emphatically the connection between the Father's love for the disciples and their love for the Son; but it also suggests that their convictions were the result of having their hearts opened by love so that they received the truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Father himself loveth you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), with love of a fatherly affection, such as mine to you, <span class="cmt_word">because ye have loved me</span> (the perfect preterit, in the sense of the realized past in the present which shall then be), and have believed that I came forth from <span class="accented">the side of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the Father</span>. In their belief of this transcendent fact is the hope of the world. It was wrought in them by the strengthening pulses of a deepening love, and to this love God himself responds with a personal tender affection that encourages boundless prayer. The disciple and lover of Jesus, having Jesus in the heart, united to him by living faith, will find in Christ that there is a perpetual pledge of reciprocal love between the Father and himself. Christ will not (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) ask the Father, because his entire position as Mediator establishes a continual appeal, is a perpetual <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, a continuous drawing near and appeal to God on our account, a pledge and guarantee of our own fellowship with and access to the Father. Our English word "intercession," though apparently corresponding with the Latin and with the Greek word, does not now represent its original meaning. That meaning is by no means equivalent to the hind of prayer which is here excluded (Trench, 'Syn. N.T.,' &sect; 51.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
