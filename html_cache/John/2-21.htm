His statement is a profound example of His use of metaphor and parable, which often left His listeners puzzled. This method of teaching was common in rabbinic tradition, where deeper truths were conveyed through indirect language. Jesus frequently used this style to reveal spiritual truths to those who were open to understanding, while concealing them from those who were not.<p><b>about the temple</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish religious life, symbolizing God's presence among His people. It was a place of worship, sacrifice, and pilgrimage. By referring to the temple, Jesus connects His mission to the heart of Jewish faith and practice. The temple was also a place of prophecy, as seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, which speaks of the Lord coming to His temple. Jesus' reference to the temple foreshadows the new covenant, where He Himself becomes the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity.<p><b>of His body.</b><br>Here, Jesus introduces the concept of His body as the true temple. This is a profound theological statement, indicating that He is the fulfillment of what the temple represented. The destruction and raising of His body in three days allude to His death and resurrection, a central tenet of Christian faith. This idea is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are described as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>) and the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).

As <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a> notes, &#8220;From that time on Jesus began to show His disciples that He must&#8230;be raised to life on the third day.&#8221; He always knew where His words were headed: the cross and the resurrection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>speaking about</b><p>- Jesus often taught through figurative statements that required spiritual ears (<a href="/john/16-25.htm">John 16:25</a>, &#8220;I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech&#8221;).<p>- He was not being evasive; He was unveiling truth step-by-step. In doing so, He prepared His followers to remember and believe after the resurrection (<a href="/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores purpose: He was actively communicating, not merely commenting.
