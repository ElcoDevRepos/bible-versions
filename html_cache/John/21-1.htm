This chapter occurs after Jesus has appeared to His disciples in Jerusalem, as recorded in previous chapters. The timing suggests a period of waiting and uncertainty for the disciples, who are still processing the reality of the resurrection and its implications for their mission.<p><b>by the Sea of Tiberias</b><br>The Sea of Tiberias is another name for the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in northern Israel. This location is significant as it was the site of much of Jesus' ministry, including the calling of some of His first disciples. The name "Tiberias" reflects the Roman influence in the region, as it was named after the Roman Emperor Tiberius. The setting by the sea is symbolic of the disciples' return to their former lives as fishermen, highlighting their need for direction and purpose post-resurrection.<p><b>Jesus again revealed Himself to the disciples</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of Jesus' appearances to His followers after His resurrection. The word "again" suggests multiple post-resurrection appearances, reinforcing the reality of His bodily resurrection. The act of revealing Himself indicates Jesus' initiative in making His presence known, underscoring His desire to reassure and instruct His disciples. This revelation is part of the forty-day period between the resurrection and the ascension, during which Jesus provided final teachings and instructions.<p><b>He made Himself known in this way</b><br>The phrase sets the stage for the specific manner in which Jesus will reveal Himself in the following verses. It suggests a deliberate and purposeful action on Jesus' part, highlighting His control over the situation. This revelation is not just a physical appearance but also a spiritual unveiling, as Jesus continues to teach and prepare His disciples for their future mission. The method of revelation often carries symbolic meaning, pointing to deeper truths about Jesus' identity and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ who reveals Himself to His disciples, demonstrating His continued presence and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are present at the Sea of Tiberias, experiencing another post-resurrection appearance of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_tiberias.htm">Sea of Tiberias</a></b><br>Also known as the Sea of Galilee, this location is significant as a place of Jesus' ministry and miracles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/revelation_of_christ.htm">Revelation of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' post-resurrection appearances are intentional and purposeful, revealing His divine nature and mission.

The opening formula is one often adopted by John (see particularly <a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1, 14</a>; <a href="/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a>); considerable periods of time and cycles of ministry are frequently covered by it. Another chapter is opened, another series of events to be recorded which had left undying impression on the apostle's mind, and, in full view of numerous other traditions, was chosen by himself as especially worthy of record. "Jesus manifested himself." In <a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a> we hear that "he manifested his glory;" now he manifested his Person, as an act of his own will. He was "manifested in the flesh" (<a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>), but now that flesh was itself more directly under the control of his personality, and the mere sensuous eye and carnal understanding could not without his special permission realize that wondrous presence. The passive form of the verb is used in <a href="/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12, 14</a>. The touch of feeling involved in the active voice must not be overlooked. The "again" clearly points back to the previous manifestations described in <a href="/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14, 19, 26</a>. On each occasion his coming, though in a recognizable human body, was a body (a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, not a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) which had the qualities of spirit. "The disciples" are afterwards mentioned by name. It was to disciples only that he "appeared." Believers in him were those alone who could see this spiritual body. The effect produced upon them was that of objective reality, but this was made to prepared spirits. Such a proceeding is akin to all the grander operations of nature, and the most august manifestations of God. "At the sea of Tiberias." This is the only place where the "sea of Galilee," or of "Gennesareth," is called the "sea of Tiberias." That it was identical with the familiar lake is evident from the known site of Tiberias (now represented by the modern town Tubarieh), a city which is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02.3; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:09. 1; 'Vit.,' &sect;&sect; 12, 13, 64), and which, from its schools of learned men, had a great place in later Jewish history. Moreover, in <a href="/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1, 23</a>, if the Greek be accurately rendered, the writer spoke of "the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias," interpreting the name well known by the Jews, through another name by which it would be better recognized by Gentiles (see note on John 6:1). Dr. Farrar, 'Message of the Books,' sees in the nomenclature a hint of the later origin of the Fourth Gospel than the date assigned to the synoptic narrative. 'Er; is used because the shore where they saw him was a raised beach or cliff" above" the sea. It must be observed that the same phrase is used in <a href="/john/6-19.htm">John 6:19</a> and <a href="/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a> for Christ's walking "upon the sea;" but the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is itself explained here by the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 4, just as the preposition receives elsewhere more literally another meaning from the context. <span class="cmt_word">And he manifested himself thus</span>; "on this wise," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after the manner to be described. This is the commencement of our Lord's discourses on the kingdom of God (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>). This was the beginning of the great fulfillment of his own predictions (<a href="/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>), and of the angel's words to the women. The narrative gives the deep heart-tones and genuine teaching of the risen Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Later,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(epi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1909.htm">Strong's 1909: </a> </span><span class="str2">On, to, against, on the basis of, at. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
