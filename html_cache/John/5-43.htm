In the cultural context of the time, coming in someone's name meant representing their authority and purpose. Jesus is asserting His identity as the Son of God, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which speaks of a child born with divine titles. The phrase also highlights the intimate relationship between Jesus and God the Father, as seen in <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, "I and the Father are one."<p><b>and you have not received Me;</b><br>This reflects the rejection Jesus faced from many of the Jewish leaders and people. Despite the signs and miracles He performed, which validated His claims, they did not accept Him as the Messiah. This rejection is a fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the Messiah as "despised and rejected by men." The cultural expectation of a political Messiah may have contributed to their inability to recognize Jesus' true mission.<p><b>but if someone else comes in his own name,</b><br>This part of the verse warns of false messiahs and leaders who would arise, seeking their own glory rather than God's. Historically, there were several figures who claimed to be the Messiah or led revolts against Roman rule, such as Simon bar Kokhba. This reflects a broader biblical theme of false prophets and teachers, as warned in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>.<p><b>you will receive him.</b><br>This highlights the tendency of people to accept those who appeal to their desires or expectations, even if they lack divine authority. It serves as a caution against being swayed by charismatic leaders who do not align with God's truth. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9-10</a>, which speaks of the coming of the lawless one with false signs and wonders, deceiving those who do not love the truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is speaking about His mission and the rejection He faces from the people He came to save.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, in whose name Jesus has come, signifying divine authority and mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' statement, representing those who reject Him despite His divine credentials.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_messiahs.htm">False Messiahs</a></b><br>Implied in the verse as those who come in their own name and are accepted by the people, contrasting with the rejection of Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of many of Jesus' teachings and confrontations with the Jewish leaders, though not explicitly mentioned in this verse, it provides the backdrop for the events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus came in the authority of the Father, which demands our recognition and acceptance.

Rejecting Jesus is rejecting the very God whose name He bears, while embracing self-styled saviors exposes hearts drawn to human pride rather than divine truth. The verse urges wholehearted reception of Christ alone, the One who comes in the Father&#8217;s name and authority, offering life to all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">I am come in my Father's name.</span>--So far from self-assertion or honour-seeking, He came in the name of, as representing, the Father, guided only by His will, doing only His work (<a href="/john/4-34.htm" title="Jesus said to them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.">John 4:34</a>).

The word "come" in this clause links the meaning with that of the "come" in the previous clause, and is to be understood of a false Messianic claim in opposition to the true. Sixty-four false Christs have been enumerated as appearing after the true Christ, and these words are often taken as a prophecy of one of the most famous of these, as Bar-Kochba. Not a few of the Fathers have understood the words of Antichrist. Perhaps the only definite reference is to the mental condition of the Jews. They would receive any other who came in his own authority, and seeking his own glory. There would be no higher principle to which everything must yield. The seeker of power would fulfil their carnal interpretation of Messianic hopes. He would flatter and honour them, and therefore they would receive him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have come in the name</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the power, with the credentials, with the encompassing revelation) <span class="cmt_word">of my Father, and ye receive me not.</span> Your idea of the Father's glory is so profoundly different from the reality, that you do not recognize it when it is offered you and shining over you. Christ did not profess to have come in his own name. He was not a mere evolution of humanity, or of Israel, or of the house of David. He was the Only Begotten of the Father, born from above, sent down from heaven. The language of the world was, "This is not Divine;" "It is too gentle, too gracious, too sympathetic for God!" The religious world listened eagerly for some echo of the trumpet peals of Sinai. It desired a king greater than Solomon, a prophet more terrible than Elijah. When he came with the real glory robes of the love of God, and with the majesty of the Name of the Lord, there was widespread disappointment and cruel rejection of his commission. <span class="cmt_word">Should another come in his own</span> (proper, peculiar) <span class="cmt_word">name</span>, that is, with no testimony from heaven, seeking "honour (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, glory) from men," creating a sovereignty by enlisting the voices of men, compromising with evil, making no warfare against the power of the world, allowing the legitimacy of the throne of the prince of this world; - should he come in his own name, alas! <span class="cmt_word">him</span> (that one) <span class="cmt_word">ye will receive.</span> The eagerness on the part of the Jews to find the Messiah has led them to accept in some sort no fewer than sixty-four false Christs (Schudt, 'Judische Merkwurdigkeit,' 6:27-30; Bengel and Meyer). Nor must the Christian Church take the flattering unction that it is free from this charge. The teacher that can utilize to the widest extent the fashionable worldliness, and can mingle the pungent human condiment with the princely food of the King's banqueting house, is he who at the present hour meets with the loudest response and the readiest reception. There is solemn warning here for statesman and author, artist and preacher. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
