It was one of the three pilgrimage feasts where Jewish males were required to appear in Jerusalem. The timing, "halfway through," indicates that Jesus chose a moment when the city was bustling with activity and the religious atmosphere was heightened, allowing His message to reach a wide audience.<p><b>Jesus went up to the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts were the outer areas of the Temple in Jerusalem, accessible to all people, including Gentiles. This setting was significant as it was a central place for teaching and discussion, where rabbis and teachers would often engage with the public. Jesus' presence here underscores His role as a teacher and His willingness to engage with the religious leaders and the people in a public forum. The temple was the heart of Jewish religious life, making it a strategic location for Jesus to reveal His teachings.<p><b>and began to teach</b><br>Jesus' teaching in the temple courts highlights His authority and wisdom, which often astonished those who heard Him. Unlike the scribes and Pharisees, Jesus taught with direct authority, often challenging traditional interpretations and focusing on the heart of the Law. His teachings were rooted in the Hebrew Scriptures, fulfilling prophecies and revealing deeper truths about God's kingdom. This act of teaching in the temple also foreshadows His role as the ultimate High Priest and the embodiment of God's Word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching in the temple courts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The outer courts of the temple in Jerusalem, a place where teaching and discussions often took place.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, during which this event occurs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Religious authorities who are often in opposition to Jesus and His teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowds.htm">Crowds</a></b><br>The people gathered in Jerusalem for the feast, listening to Jesus' teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_teaching.htm">The Importance of Teaching</a></b><br>Jesus prioritized teaching, even during significant festivals, highlighting the importance of spiritual education.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Despite not having formal rabbinical training, Jesus taught with authority, demonstrating His divine wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_proclamation.htm">Courage in Proclamation</a></b><br>Jesus taught openly in the temple courts, despite knowing the opposition He faced, encouraging believers to be bold in sharing their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/engagement_with_culture.htm">Engagement with Culture</a></b><br>Jesus engaged with the people during a major cultural and religious event, showing the importance of meeting people where they are.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuous_learning.htm">Continuous Learning</a></b><br>Just as Jesus taught in the temple, believers are encouraged to continually seek understanding and growth in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_7_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 7:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_divine_authority_in_John_7_14.htm">How does Jesus' teaching in John 7:14 demonstrate His divine authority and wisdom?

We can only conjecture the theme of these instructions. They must have been sufficiently varied and peculiar to have excited much attention. Either parable, or apothegm, or stirring appeal, or quotation and interpretation from the Old Testament, or voice from the fathomless depths of his own consciousness, may have formed its staple. In his burning summons to conscience, and his gracious offers of mercy, the people who had listened to him on the mountainside or lakeside were accustomed to say, "He speaks with authority, not as the scribes." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">About halfway through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#963;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(mesous&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3322.htm">Strong's 3322: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be in the middle, be advanced midway.
