In the context of John's Gospel, truth is a central theme, with Jesus Himself being described as "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The Holy Spirit's role is to guide believers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>), revealing the truth of God's Word and the reality of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of truth contrasts with the spirit of error and deception prevalent in the world (1 <a href="/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6</a>).<p><b>The world cannot receive Him</b><br>The "world" here refers to the system of human society that is opposed to God and His purposes. This world is characterized by unbelief and spiritual blindness, unable to accept the Holy Spirit because it operates on a different plane of understanding. The inability to receive the Spirit is due to a lack of faith and spiritual discernment, as Paul explains in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God.<p><b>because it neither sees Him nor knows Him</b><br>The world is limited to physical perception and does not recognize the spiritual reality of the Holy Spirit. This echoes the earlier theme in John's Gospel where Jesus is not recognized by the world (<a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>). The knowledge of the Holy Spirit is not intellectual but relational and experiential, requiring a heart open to God's revelation.<p><b>But you do know Him</b><br>Jesus assures His disciples that they have a personal relationship with the Holy Spirit. This knowledge is based on their relationship with Jesus, who has revealed the Father to them. The disciples' understanding of the Spirit is rooted in their faith and the teachings they have received from Jesus, distinguishing them from the unbelieving world.<p><b>for He abides with you</b><br>The Holy Spirit's presence with the disciples is a current reality. This abiding presence is a fulfillment of God's promise to dwell with His people, as seen in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45-46</a>). The Spirit's abiding presence is a source of comfort, guidance, and empowerment for the disciples, enabling them to continue Jesus' mission.<p><b>and will be in you</b><br>This future promise points to the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2), when the Spirit would indwell believers permanently. This indwelling marks a new era in God's relationship with His people, where the Spirit empowers, sanctifies, and seals believers for redemption (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>).
