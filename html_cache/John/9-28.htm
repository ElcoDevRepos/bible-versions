This reflects their growing animosity towards Jesus and His followers. Insulting was a common tactic used by those in power to discredit and intimidate. This behavior is consistent with the Pharisees' previous interactions with Jesus, where they often resorted to verbal attacks when their authority was challenged (<a href="/john/8-48.htm">John 8:48</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;You are His disciple;</b><br>The healed man is accused of being a disciple of Jesus, which, in the context of the time, was a serious charge. Being a disciple of Jesus meant aligning oneself with His teachings, which were seen as radical and threatening to the established religious order. This accusation highlights the division between those who followed Jesus and those who adhered strictly to the Mosaic Law. The term "disciple" implies a committed follower, suggesting that the man&#8217;s acknowledgment of Jesus' miracle was seen as a declaration of allegiance.<p><b>we are disciples of Moses.</b><br>The Pharisees prided themselves on their adherence to the Mosaic Law, which they believed was the ultimate expression of God's will. By claiming to be disciples of Moses, they are asserting their authority and legitimacy. Moses is a central figure in Jewish history, representing the law and covenant given by God. This statement underscores the tension between the old covenant, represented by Moses, and the new covenant, represented by Jesus. The Pharisees' reliance on Moses is contrasted with Jesus' fulfillment of the law, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>, which states that grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was born blind and healed by Jesus, becoming a central figure in this chapter as he testifies about Jesus' miracle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who are skeptical of Jesus and challenge the healed man, representing the religious authority of the time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, who performs the miracle of healing the blind man, demonstrating His divine authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A revered prophet in Judaism, representing the Law and the old covenant, whom the Pharisees claim to follow.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>The setting for much of the dialogue, representing the religious and communal life of the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_blindness.htm">Understanding Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>The Pharisees' rejection of Jesus despite the evidence of the miracle highlights spiritual blindness.
