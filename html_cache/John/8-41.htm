The "works" refer to actions and behaviors that reflect one's true spiritual lineage. Jesus implies that their actions align more with Satan, whom He later identifies as their father in a spiritual sense (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). This accusation is rooted in the broader biblical theme that one's actions reveal one's true allegiance (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>). The concept of spiritual paternity is significant in Jewish thought, where lineage and heritage are crucial, yet Jesus redefines it in terms of spiritual obedience and truth.<p><b>&#8220;We are not illegitimate children,&#8221; they declared.</b><br>The Jewish leaders respond defensively, asserting their legitimate descent from Abraham and, by extension, their covenant relationship with God. The term "illegitimate children" could imply a denial of any spiritual or moral impurity. Historically, Jewish identity was closely tied to Abrahamic descent, and being considered illegitimate would undermine their claim to God's promises. This statement also reflects a possible allusion to rumors about Jesus' own birth, which some opponents might have considered illegitimate (<a href="/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18-25</a>). The leaders' emphasis on legitimacy underscores their misunderstanding of Jesus' spiritual message.<p><b>&#8220;Our only Father is God Himself.&#8221;</b><br>Here, the Jewish leaders assert their monotheistic faith and covenant relationship with God, echoing the Shema, a central declaration of Jewish faith: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one" (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). They claim God as their Father, which in Jewish tradition signifies a special relationship and chosen status (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>). However, Jesus challenges this claim by pointing out that true children of God would recognize and accept Him, as He is sent by the Father (<a href="/john/8-42.htm">John 8:42</a>). This statement highlights the tension between physical descent and spiritual kinship, a theme that runs throughout the New Testament (<a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Jewish leaders and people, challenging their understanding of spiritual lineage and true obedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience Jesus is speaking to, who claim Abraham as their father and assert their legitimacy as God's children.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in the chapter, Abraham is a patriarchal figure whom the Jewish leaders claim as their ancestor, representing their spiritual heritage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The ultimate spiritual Father, whom Jesus contrasts with the earthly claims of the Jewish leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>Implicitly referenced as the "father" whose works the Jewish leaders are doing, according to Jesus, highlighting the spiritual deception and sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_lineage_vs._physical_descent.htm">Spiritual Lineage vs. Physical Descent</a></b><br>True spiritual lineage is determined by faith and obedience to God, not merely by physical descent or heritage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_spiritual_pride.htm">The Danger of Spiritual Pride</a></b><br>Claiming a spiritual heritage without living in accordance with God's will can lead to self-deception and spiritual pride.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_true_fatherhood.htm">The Importance of True Fatherhood</a></b><br>Recognizing God as our true Father involves aligning our actions and beliefs with His will, as revealed through Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith_in_spiritual_identity.htm">The Role of Faith in Spiritual Identity</a></b><br>Faith in Jesus Christ is the defining characteristic of being a child of God, transcending ethnic or cultural backgrounds.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_transformation.htm">Repentance and Transformation</a></b><br>True children of God demonstrate their relationship with Him through repentance and a transformed life that reflects His character.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_8_41_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 8:41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_8_41_Examine_spiritual_roots.htm">How does John 8:41 challenge us to examine our spiritual parentage today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Pharisees_view_on_legitimacy.htm">What does "we are not illegitimate children" reveal about the Pharisees' mindset?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Align_actions_with_God_s_children.htm">How can we ensure our actions align with being God's children, as in John 8:41?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_John_8_41_Gal_4_6_on_sonship.htm">Compare John 8:41 with Galatians 4:6.

Abrupt and startling was the retort: <span class="cmt_word">We are</span> [were] <span class="cmt_word">not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.</span> Many expositors think that these Jews began to babble against the possibility of their being bastard children of Sarah, or to protest that they were not Ishmaelites or any collateral branch of the seed of Abraham, like the Idumaeans or the sons of Keturah. This is far away from the context, and unworthy of the controversy. The idea is sufficiently explained by the second clause. The covenant relation between Jehovah and Israel is so constantly referred to in the Old Testament (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>) under the image of marriage and the unfaithfulness of particular generations to Jehovah; and their false worship and idolatry are so often regarded as "fornication" and "adultery" from God, the Husband of the dedicated spouse, so that nothing is more probable, when Jesus charged them with doing the works of their father, that they should have exclaimed, "Surely we have no idolatrous sympathies. None but Jehovah is our God. Thou must not charge us with any compromise with the accursed thing." The wild rage which the Jews had shown to Pilate in the matter of the shields, their abhorrence of the defilement of idols in the matter of food, their avoidance even of the supreme court of Roman justice under fear of idolatrous contamination, explain the outflash of this indignant rejoinder. This view is, in the main, advocated by De Wette, Lampe, Lucke, Lange, and Hengstenberg; but opposed by Meyer, Westcott: "We do not owe our position to idolatrous desertion of Jehovah. We are the offspring of the union of God with his chosen people. Our spiritual descent is as pure as our historical descent." Godet modifies it: "We have no idolatrous <span class="accented">blood</span> in our veins; we are Hebrews of the Hebrews."
