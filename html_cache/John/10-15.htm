In biblical context, the term "knows" implies a deep, personal, and experiential knowledge, not merely intellectual awareness. This relationship is foundational to the Christian understanding of the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet one. The knowledge between the Father and the Son is perfect and complete, reflecting divine unity and purpose. This mirrors the Old Testament concept of God's covenantal knowledge of Israel, where knowing implies a chosen relationship (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>).<p><b>and I know the Father.</b><br>Here, Jesus asserts His divine knowledge of the Father, affirming His deity and equality with God. This mutual knowledge signifies the perfect harmony and agreement in the divine will and mission. It also highlights Jesus' authority and authenticity as the Son of God, who reveals the Father to humanity (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>). This mutual knowledge is a model for believers, who are called to know God through Christ, as seen in the New Testament's emphasis on knowing God through a relationship with Jesus (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>).<p><b>And I lay down My life for the sheep.</b><br>This statement is a prophetic declaration of Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. The imagery of the shepherd laying down his life for the sheep is rooted in the cultural and historical context of shepherding in ancient Israel, where shepherds were known to risk their lives to protect their flocks. This act of laying down His life is voluntary and purposeful, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. It also connects to the typology of the Passover lamb, where Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). This phrase underscores the theme of substitutionary atonement, where Jesus dies in place of His people, ensuring their salvation and eternal security.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who is speaking about His relationship with the Father and His sacrificial role as the Good Shepherd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, highlighting the intimate and reciprocal knowledge between Him and Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep.htm">The Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolic of believers who follow Jesus, representing those who benefit from His sacrificial love and protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/intimate_knowledge_and_relationship.htm">Intimate Knowledge and Relationship</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the deep, personal relationship He shares with the Father.

This mutual knowledge is complete&#8212;no secrets, no distance. <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a> reminds us, &#8220;No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son.&#8221;<p>&#8226;That same depth of relationship appears in <a href="/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24-26</a>, where Jesus prays that His followers would behold His glory and know the Father&#8217;s love.<p>&#8226;The statement also affirms Jesus&#8217; full divinity. Only One who is truly God can be known perfectly by the Father and know Him in return (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-2, 18</a>).<p>&#8226;Because this knowledge is relational, not merely informational, it becomes the model for how believers are invited into fellowship with God (<a href="/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>; <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226;Jesus sets up a comparison: the way He and the Father relate becomes the foundation for everything He does next on behalf of the sheep.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I lay down My life for the sheep</b><p>&#8220;And I lay down My life for the sheep&#8221;<p>&#8226;The intimacy just described moves Jesus to sacrificial action. He willingly gives His life; it is not taken from Him (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226;By calling His followers &#8220;the sheep,&#8221; Jesus ties the whole chapter together: He is the Good Shepherd who does more than guide&#8212;He dies in their place (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226;This is substitutionary atonement: He absorbs the danger and judgment that rightly belong to the flock (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226;Love motivates the sacrifice. &#8220;Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>).<p>&#8226;The Shepherd&#8217;s death secures life for the sheep, granting them eternal security (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>) and reconciling them to God (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/10-15.htm">John 10:15</a> bridges heavenly relationship and earthly rescue. The perfect knowledge shared by Father and Son displays Christ&#8217;s full deity and unbroken fellowship with the Father. Flowing directly from that divine intimacy, Jesus offers Himself as the Shepherd who dies for His sheep, guaranteeing their salvation and safety. Knowing who He is explains why He does what He does&#8212;and our confidence rests on both truths.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">and I know the Father.</span> Our version, by its rendering, and by the division of verses, fails to give the full meaning, and there is thus, indeed, no reason for the assertion of the mutual knowledge of the Father and the Son. But connecting the words with those of the previous verse, we have, "I am the Good Shepherd, and know <span class= "ital">those who are Mine, and those who are Mine know Me, even as the Father knoweth Me, and I know the Father."</span> This deeper sense of union between the human spirit and Himself, and the wondrous likening of it to the union of Himself and the Father, is present to His mind as the close of His work on earth draws near. We find it again in <a href="/john/14-20.htm" title="At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.">John 14:20</a>; <a href="/john/15-10.htm" title="If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.">John 15:10</a>; <a href="/john/17-8.htm" title="For I have given to them the words which you gave me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from you, and they have believed that you did send me.">John 17:8</a>; <a href="/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>. It is bound up with the thought of the love which lays down His own life for them. This is repeated here and again in <a href="/context/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17-18</a>.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">just as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
