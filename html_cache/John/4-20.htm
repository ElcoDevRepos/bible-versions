Historically, the Samaritans believed that Mount Gerizim was the true holy site chosen by God for worship, as opposed to Jerusalem. This belief is rooted in their version of the Pentateuch, which emphasizes Gerizim. The Samaritans built a temple on this mountain, which was destroyed by the Hasmonean leader John Hyrcanus around 128 BC. The reference to "our fathers" indicates a long-standing tradition and highlights the deep-seated religious and cultural divide between Samaritans and Jews. This division is evident in the historical animosity and differing religious practices between the two groups.<p><b>but you Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the Jewish belief that Jerusalem is the central place of worship, specifically the Temple Mount, where Solomon's Temple once stood and where the Second Temple was located during Jesus' time. Jerusalem's significance is rooted in several Old Testament scriptures, such as <a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>, where God chose Jerusalem for His name to dwell. The Jewish focus on Jerusalem as the exclusive place of worship underscores the covenantal promises made to David and the establishment of the temple as the dwelling place of God's presence. This statement by the Samaritan woman reflects the theological and cultural tensions between Jews and Samaritans, as well as the broader question of the true location for worship, which Jesus addresses in the subsequent verses by emphasizing worship in spirit and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_woman.htm">Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>A resident of Samaria who engages in a theological discussion with Jesus at Jacob's well.

It is not that the question of worship is the all-engrossing problem of her mind, for which she seeks solution at this prophet's hands. Such questions hardly came then within the circle of a Samaritan woman's thoughts, and this woman's life had not been such as to make her an exception to the rule; but the heart, quivering before the eye that reads it as it never before had read itself, shrinks from the light that is let in upon it. She will speak of anything rather than of self. There is the mountain overhanging them, the theme of many a discussion between Samaritan and Jew; she will ask the prophet to decide that question.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our fathers.</span> The "our" refers here to the Samaritans, just as the "ye" does to the Jews. She may be going back once more to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who worshipped and laboured at Shechem - but the mountain itself was not the site of a temple until the days of Nehemiah, and the temple in which the apostate Manasseh, son of Jaddua, offered sacrifices had been destroyed for nearly a hundred and fifty years. A chronological, if not more serious, difference is apparent between Nehemiah and Josephus (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 11:08. 2; <a href="/nehemiah/13-28.htm">Nehemiah 13:28</a>). According to the former, the Samaritan schism which led to the erection of the temple was a hundred years before the period assigned by Josephus. For whereas Nehemiah says that the apostate priest whom he chased away was son-in-law of Sanballat, the Persian satrap in Samaria, Josephus makes Sanballat contemporary with Alexander, and represents the establishment of the Samaritan temple as originating with his approval. Josephus further ('Ant.,' 13:09, 1) says that the temple was destroyed by Hyrcanus, about <span class="date">B.C. 129</span>, and adds that it had stood two hundred years. The temple was destroyed, but "the mountain of blessing" remained for the Samaritans as a place of prayer ('Ant.,' 18:04. 1; 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:02, 6). This was conserved, on the ground that Abraham and Jacob had here built altars (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4-13</a>). In <a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4</a>, however, Mount Ebal in mentioned as the place where an altar had been first built to Jehovah. In the Samaritan Pentateuch the word "Gerizim" had in this place been substituted for "Ebal;" and so it came to pass that Gerizim had been a place of prayer throughout the long interval When Jesus was at Jacob's well, he could see the ruins of the edifice where sacrifice and praises were being offered. Indeed, these have continued to the present day. The oldest shrine in the world for local worship still holds its own, hard by the very spot where the most complete overthrow of the principle of sacred places fell in divinest words from the lips of the Holy One. Our fathers <span class="cmt_word">worshipped in this mountain</span> - Gerizim, where the ruins of the temple still abide - <span class="cmt_word">and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship.</span> Jerusalem is not mentioned in their sacred books - Jerusalem, whose unity of sanctuary was recognized at length as the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> where the Lord would put his Name, and where alone the sacrifices could possess their historic and symbolic validity. Whensoever the Pentateuch may have been finally edited, all critics will allow that, at the time of the Lord, and in the Samaritan Version of the Pentateuch, the idea of such unity of sanctuary was a fixed principle. The Samaritans claimed Gerizim, and the Jews Moriah, as the place where Abraham offered his typical <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, and both regarded the worship celebrated in their favourite shrine - the daily offering, the annual feasts (the Passover especially) - as giving worthiness to all the prayers and praises which they might be induced to offer in all places where they might sojourn. The woman does not submit to our Lord that he may settle this great question for her, but she makes it clear enough that she would like to know his verdict. The worship was the sacrificial worship where sin such as hers could alone be cleansed, and where her conscience could be set free for calm and continuous communion with God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Our</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;m&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
