In the cultural and religious context of first-century Judaism, stoning was a prescribed punishment for blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). The leaders acknowledged Jesus' good works, which included healing and teaching, but they were more concerned with what they perceived as a violation of the Law. This reflects the tension between Jesus' ministry and the religious authorities, who were often more focused on legalistic interpretations than on the spirit of the Law.<p><b>&#8220;but for blasphemy,</b><br>Blasphemy, in Jewish law, was a serious offense, often involving speaking irreverently about God or claiming divine status. The accusation of blasphemy against Jesus was based on His claims of divinity, which the Jewish leaders saw as a direct challenge to their understanding of monotheism. This charge is significant because it highlights the growing conflict between Jesus and the religious authorities, who were unable to accept His identity as the Son of God.<p><b>because You, who are a man,</b><br>The emphasis on Jesus being a man underscores the Jewish leaders' inability to comprehend His dual nature as both fully human and fully divine. This reflects the broader theological challenge of the Incarnation, which is central to Christian doctrine. The leaders' focus on Jesus' humanity prevented them from recognizing His divine authority and mission.<p><b>make Yourself out to be God.&#8221;</b><br>This statement directly addresses the core issue of Jesus' identity. Throughout the Gospel of John, Jesus makes several "I am" statements (e.g., <a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) that align Him with the divine name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>. The Jewish leaders understood these claims as equating Himself with God, which they considered blasphemous. This accusation ultimately led to Jesus' crucifixion, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's suffering (Isaiah 53). The charge of blasphemy also highlights the misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and the nature of His kingdom, which was not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, accused of blasphemy by the Jews for claiming divinity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Religious leaders and people who are confronting Jesus, accusing Him of blasphemy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The likely setting for this confrontation, a city central to Jewish religious life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/blasphemy.htm">Blasphemy</a></b><br>The charge brought against Jesus, which in Jewish law was a serious offense punishable by stoning.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/stoning.htm">Stoning</a></b><br>The intended punishment for blasphemy, highlighting the severity of the accusation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_divinity.htm">Understanding Jesus' Divinity</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus' claim to be God is central to Christian faith.

Jesus did claim equality with God (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>).<p>- Rather than rebuke their understanding, Jesus responded by grounding His claim in Scripture (<a href="/john/10-34.htm">John 10:34-38</a>), reinforcing that He is the consecrated Son the Father sent into the world.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a> captures the clash between undeniable works and unwavering unbelief. The leaders concede Jesus&#8217; works are good, yet they accuse Him of blasphemy because He, a man before their eyes, openly claims to be God. Their reaction highlights the central issue of the gospel: Jesus is both fully man and fully God. Accepting His good works without embracing His divine identity leaves a person still outside the truth. John records this exchange so that we might see the signs, hear His claims, and believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing we may have life in His name (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">The Jews answered him.</span>--Comp for the thoughts of this verse Notes on <a href="/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one.">John 10:30</a> and on <a href="/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For a good work . . . but for blasphemy.</span>--The word rendered "for" is not the causal "on account of," which we have in the last verse, but "concerning," the technical form for an indictment.

This preposition was used for formal indictments of offence before the tribunals.) The Jews felt the force of this indignant reproach, and would not admit that his Divine and goodly work was without meaning to them. It was, however, a melancholy reality that his beneficent work had roused their malice into fiercer activity, but they credit themselves with a higher and a doctrinal motive and with a jealousy for the honor of God. They charge him with blasphemy, and the charge is reiterated before Pilate (<a href="/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>). The Jews were in one sense right. He had declared his essential unity with the Father; he had "made himself, represented himself (cf. <a href="/john/8-53.htm">John 8:53</a>; <a href="/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>), as equal with God." In the opinion of his hearers, he conveyed the idea that he possessed and was wielding Divine powers. He was making himself to be God. "Good works" by the score were no vindication of one who dishonored the Name of God by claiming equality with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;We are not stoning</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#953;&#952;&#940;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(lithazomen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3034.htm">Strong's 3034: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stone, pelt with stones.
