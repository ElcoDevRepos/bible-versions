It is set during the Last Supper, a pivotal moment before His crucifixion. Jesus is preparing His disciples for His imminent departure, emphasizing the importance of His final teachings. This moment is part of the Upper Room Discourse, where Jesus provides comfort and instruction to His followers. The urgency reflects the fulfillment of His earthly mission and the transition to His sacrificial role.<p><b>for the prince of this world is coming</b><br>The "prince of this world" refers to Satan, who is often depicted as having temporary authority over earthly matters. This phrase highlights the spiritual battle between Jesus and the forces of evil. Satan's influence is evident in the betrayal by Judas and the subsequent events leading to the crucifixion. The coming of the "prince" signifies the intensification of this spiritual conflict. This aligns with other scriptural references to Satan's role, such as in <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, where he is described as having dominion over the present age.<p><b>and he has no claim on Me</b><br>This statement asserts Jesus' sinlessness and His authority over Satan. Despite Satan's attempts to thwart God's plan, he has no power over Jesus, who is without sin and fully obedient to the Father. This echoes the prophecy of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the serpent's head is destined to be crushed by the seed of the woman. Jesus' declaration of having no claim by Satan underscores His divine nature and the ultimate victory over sin and death.

Yet Satan never operates outside God&#8217;s sovereign allowance (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>).

This term is continually found in rabbinical writings for the great central power of evil in the world. The activity of evil was then at work. Satan entered into Judas; the spirit of evil was rampant in all the machination of the leaders of the people. The eagles of this impure host were gathering. The last conflict impended. The prince of the world, who shall be cast out, judged and conquered, <span class="cmt_word">cometh, and hath nothing in me</span>. The conflict between the second Adam and the devil culminates. Christ looks through the whole army of his opponents, and feels that he has to wrestle with the ruler of the darkness of the world, but at the same time is sublimely conscious that there is nothing in him on which the evil can fasten. Christ certainly claims a sinlessness of inner nature which no other saint has arrogated to himself. Accusations of the world were numerous enough, but those who brought them were ignorant. Now he has to do with one who knows him, but not so well as he knows himself. The double negation, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, must be noticed - "absolutely nothing." Thus he virtually repeats his own utterance, "I am not of this world." This great word presupposes again the uniqueness of Christ's Personality and consciousness. With every other man the higher the conception of the Divine Law and claim, so. much the deeper becomes the sense of departure from it. In Christ's case his lofty knowledge of the Father only makes him know, and even compels him to confess, his reconciliation, his obedience, and his inward sinlessness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/14-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I will {not} speak</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#955;&#942;&#963;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(lal&#275;s&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2980.htm">Strong's 2980: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an otherwise obsolete verb; to talk, i.e. Utter words.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#952;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(meth&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hym&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
