This phrase reflects the common reaction of amazement to Jesus' works, as seen throughout the Gospels. It also serves as a prelude to a profound truth about resurrection and judgment. The call to not be amazed suggests that what Jesus is about to reveal is part of God's divine plan, consistent with Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's role in bringing life and judgment (<a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>).<p><b>for the hour is coming</b><br>This phrase indicates a specific future time, emphasizing the certainty and imminence of the event Jesus is describing. The "hour" often refers to a divinely appointed time in the New Testament, particularly in the context of Jesus' mission and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23</a>, <a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>). It underscores the eschatological aspect of Jesus' ministry, pointing to the future resurrection and final judgment.<p><b>when all who are in their graves</b><br>The reference to "all who are in their graves" highlights the universal scope of the resurrection. This includes both the righteous and the wicked, indicating a comprehensive resurrection of all humanity. The concept of resurrection was a well-established belief in Jewish thought, particularly among the Pharisees, and is rooted in Old Testament scriptures (<a href="/ezekiel/37-12.htm">Ezekiel 37:12-14</a>). It affirms the belief in life after death and the eventual restoration of the body.<p><b>will hear His voice</b><br>The phrase "will hear His voice" signifies the authority and power of Jesus, as it is His voice that will call the dead to rise. This echoes the authority of God in creation, where His word brought life into existence (Genesis 1). It also connects to other instances in the Gospels where Jesus' voice commands authority over life and death, such as the raising of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>). This demonstrates Jesus' divine nature and His role as the life-giver, fulfilling the messianic prophecies of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the Jews and explaining His divine authority and the future resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead.htm">The Dead</a></b><br>Refers to "all who are in their graves," indicating those who have physically died.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hour.htm">The Hour</a></b><br>A future time appointed by God when the resurrection will occur.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice.htm">The Voice</a></b><br>The authoritative call of Jesus, which will summon the dead from their graves.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/graves.htm">Graves</a></b><br>Symbolic of death and the physical resting place of the deceased.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_resurrection.htm">The Certainty of Resurrection</a></b><br>Jesus assures us that the resurrection is a definite future event.

There shall follow from this "greater works," at which they shall marvel. There is an hour coming (here not with the addition "and now is," verse .25) when the victory over physical death shall also make manifest this life, for "all that are in the graves" shall hear His voice, and the final judgment shall declare to the universe His authority to judge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - It is impossible not to draw a distinction between the theme of these verses and that of vers. 24, 25. The Lord announces an event which is in the future altogether. The "and now is," which characterized the first resurrection of which he spoke, is here omitted. The description of the subjects of the resurrection as those "in their graves," contradistinguishes them from "the dead" of ver. 25 - a phrase which will suffer several interpretations. The universality of the summons, and the impossibility of neglecting it or ignoring it, form another marked contrast to the resurrection already referred to. <span class="cmt_word">Marvel not at this!</span> At what? Clearly at the entire statement that the resurrection of dead souls will be the undoubted issue of accepting Christ's word and identifying it with the word of God. <span class="accented">Marvel</span> not that the judgment of the world is entrusted to "the Son," because he is both Son of man as well as Son of God. "Marvel not" is a relative word. It means obviously that there is a greater marvel still in store. <span class="cmt_word">Because the hour is coming;</span> always coming, though it seemeth long - coming swiftly, measured on the great clock face of the universe. Geological time, astronomical aeons, should before this have rebuked our impertinence about the delays of God, and our shallow criticism of the fulness of the times. "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." As compared with geological annals, still less with God's eternities, it is only the day before yesterday when Adam fell; it is only yesterday that Jesus died and rose again, and tomorrow that he will come in his glory. <span class="cmt_word">The hour is coming when all who are in the graves shall hear his voice.</span> The same voice that wakes the spiritually dead shall pierce the clods, shall find the buried dead, shall bring once more into the world of the visible and tangible the long forgotten lived. Every solitary life lives with him and before him. The organic clothing of the spirit, which goes on, as St. Paul suggests (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>) from the death of the physical body till the coming of the Son of God with glory, does not render this statement more difficult, but more comprehensible. As far as this world is concerned, those who are clothed upon with the house not made with hands - those who are with Christ, are to all appearance dead, and in their "graves," in their memorial places; but they will all hear the voice of the Son, <span class="cmt_word">and they will come, forth; they that have</span> <span class="cmt_word">done</span> <span class="cmt_word">good</span> <span class="cmt_word">things, to the resurrection of life; they that have practised evil things, to the resurrection of judgment</span>. They will come forth from these hiding places of fading memories. Even tombs of prophets and kings are themselves buried, covered by the graves of the many generations that have followed. The grave hidden will come forth into what we call the reality, visibility, tangibility, of things. The hour is coming on apace when Death himself shall be dead, and the mystery of time be finished. They that rise will divide themselves into two classes. The anastasis will have two forms. There is a "resurrection of life" and a "resurrection of judgment." Those who have indeed passed from spiritual death to life will not come into "judgment" (not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) when their anastasis is complete, their judgment is over, their life is secure. When those who have not heard the voice of the Son of God, have not come to the light, who are not of God nor of the truth - men who have deliberately practised "evil things" without compunction or amendment, - when these are called from their tombs, from their shadowy hiding places, into the presence of him who executes judgment, it will be to undergo the (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) judgment (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). We must, indeed, all be made manifest before the judgment throne of Christ, to receive the consequences of "the doing of well" and "the practice of evil." The issue of the one is <span class="accented">life</span>, and of the other is <span class="accented">judgment.</span> The suggestion seems to be that such judgment may issue unfavourably, but the thought is centred upon the process of the judgment. The effort of Reuss and others to draw a marked distinction between the eschatology of the synoptists and of John fails. Christ does not represent the spiritual resurrection as "greater work" than the physical resurrection. On the contrary, white he speaks of the <span class="accented">marvelling</span> of his hearers at his claim to quicken the spiritually dead, yet the ground of their marvel is emphatically arrested (see ver. 28) until they should recognize to the full the fact that, as Son of God and Son of man, he would call all the dead from their graves.
