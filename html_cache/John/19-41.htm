Theologically, the garden setting evokes the Garden of Eden, where sin entered the world, and now, in this garden, redemption is being accomplished. Geographically, this garden was near Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion, which was outside the city walls of Jerusalem. The proximity of the garden to the crucifixion site suggests that it was a private garden, possibly owned by a wealthy individual, as gardens were not common in urban areas.<p><b>and in the garden a new tomb</b><br>The new tomb signifies that it was unused, which fulfills the Jewish customs of purity and the prophecy that the Messiah would be buried with the rich (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). The newness of the tomb also symbolizes the new covenant and the new creation that Jesus' resurrection would inaugurate. Archaeologically, tombs in this period were often hewn out of rock and sealed with a large stone, indicating that this was a tomb of some importance and expense.<p><b>in which no one had yet been laid</b><br>This detail emphasizes the purity and sanctity of the tomb, as it was not defiled by previous bodies, aligning with Jewish burial customs. It also underscores the fulfillment of prophecy and typology, as Jesus, the sinless Lamb of God, was laid in a tomb that had not been used, symbolizing His unique role in salvation history. Theologically, this points to Jesus as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), as He is the first to rise from the dead, paving the way for the resurrection of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the crucifixion and resurrection account.

The garden recalls Eden yet foreshadows new creation. Crucifixion and burial share the same ground, displaying God&#8217;s orchestration. A brand-new, unused tomb supplied by a rich disciple fulfills Isaiah&#8217;s forecast and secures unmistakable evidence for the resurrection. Every phrase underscores that Jesus truly died, was truly buried, and would truly rise, turning the place of death into the very birthplace of eternal life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1</a>. St. John's account makes the choice of the sepulchre depend on its nearness to the place of crucifixion; the account in the earlier Gospels makes it depend on the fact that the sepulchre belonged to Joseph.
