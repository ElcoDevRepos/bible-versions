Jesus is on the outskirts of Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, which is significant as it is the setting for the miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead. The delay in entering the village highlights Jesus' intentional timing, which is a recurring theme in His ministry, as seen in <a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a> and <a href="/john/7-6.htm">John 7:6</a>. The village of Bethany is also significant as it is the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, who are close friends of Jesus, emphasizing the personal nature of this miracle.<p><b>but was still at the place</b><br>This suggests a deliberate pause by Jesus, which can be seen as a moment of reflection or prayer. It underscores His divine foreknowledge and control over the situation. This pause can be compared to other moments in Jesus' ministry where He takes time to pray or prepare before significant events, such as in <a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a> before choosing the twelve apostles.<p><b>where Martha had met Him</b><br>Martha's meeting with Jesus earlier in the chapter (<a href="/john/11-20.htm">John 11:20-27</a>) is a profound moment of faith and declaration. Martha expresses her belief in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God, which is a central theme in the Gospel of John. This meeting place becomes a symbolic location of faith and revelation. Martha's interaction with Jesus also reflects the cultural role of women in the New Testament, where they are often portrayed as key witnesses to Jesus' identity and works, as seen with Mary Magdalene in <a href="/john/20-18.htm">John 20:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.
