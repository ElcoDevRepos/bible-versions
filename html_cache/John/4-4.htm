While Jews often avoided Samaria due to deep-seated animosity, Jesus' journey through Samaria was intentional, highlighting His mission to reach all people, including those marginalized or despised by society. This reflects the divine plan and purpose in Jesus' ministry, emphasizing His role as the Savior for all humanity, transcending ethnic and cultural barriers.<p><b>through Samaria.</b><br>Samaria was a region between Judea and Galilee, inhabited by the Samaritans, who were of mixed descent and practiced a form of Judaism that was considered heretical by mainstream Jews. The historical hostility between Jews and Samaritans stemmed from events such as the Assyrian conquest and the establishment of a rival temple on Mount Gerizim. By choosing to travel through Samaria, Jesus broke social norms and demonstrated His message of reconciliation and inclusion. This journey foreshadows the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to be witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is traveling from Judea to Galilee.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>A region between Judea and Galilee, often avoided by Jews due to historical enmity and religious differences.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritans.htm">Samaritans</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Samaria, who were of mixed ethnicity and religion, often despised by the Jews.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea.htm">Judea</a></b><br>The southern region of ancient Israel, where Jesus was coming from.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>The northern region of ancient Israel, where Jesus was heading.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_necessity.htm">Divine Necessity</a></b><br>Jesus "had to pass through Samaria" not just geographically but as part of His divine mission to break down barriers and reach the lost.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/breaking_cultural_barriers.htm">Breaking Cultural Barriers</a></b><br>Jesus' journey through Samaria demonstrates His willingness to transcend cultural and ethnic divisions, setting an example for His followers to do the same.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intentional_ministry.htm">Intentional Ministry</a></b><br>Jesus' deliberate choice to go through Samaria shows the importance of intentionality in ministry, seeking out those who are marginalized or overlooked.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_mission.htm">God's Sovereignty in Mission</a></b><br>The necessity of passing through Samaria highlights God's sovereign plan in reaching all people, regardless of their background or societal status.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_4_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 4:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jesus_go_through_Samaria.htm">Why was it necessary for Jesus to pass through Samaria in John 4:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/John_4_4_Jesus_ministry_intent.htm">How does John 4:4 demonstrate Jesus' intentionality in His ministry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/OT_links_to_Jesus_Samaria_journey.htm">What Old Testament connections can be made with Jesus' journey through Samaria?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Jesus_travel_example_daily.htm">How can we apply Jesus' example of purposeful travel in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_4_4_Breaking_cultural_barriers.htm">What does John 4:4 teach about breaking cultural barriers for the Gospel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jesus_go_through_Samaria_2.htm">Why did Jesus need to pass through Samaria in John 4:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Samaria_s_role_in_biblical_history.htm">What is the significance of Samaria in biblical history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_4_4_How_does_it_defy_norms.htm">How does John 4:4 challenge cultural boundaries of the time?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_the_samaritan_woman_unnamed.htm">Why is the Samaritan woman unnamed, leaving no external historical record to corroborate the event in John 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_were_the_samaritans_in_the_bible.htm">Who were the Samaritans in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_samaritan_pentateuch.htm">What is the Samaritan Pentateuch?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_contextualization_mean.htm">What does contextualization mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 4:4 Mean</div><b>Now</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Now&#8221; situates the moment in real time, tying it to the preceding verses where &#8220;Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;now&#8221; to mark a Spirit-directed transition (cf. <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26-27</a>). Here it signals that Jesus is moving at exactly the right divine moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He had</b><p>&#8226; The subject is Jesus&#8212;fully God, fully man&#8212;who lives in perfect obedience to the Father&#8217;s will (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Had&#8221; conveys divine compulsion, echoing statements like &#8220;the Son of Man must suffer many things&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>) and &#8220;I must preach the good news &#8230; for that is why I was sent&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>).<p>&#8226; This sense of necessity underscores that every step in Jesus&#8217; ministry, even travel routes, fulfills God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to pass</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;To pass&#8221; indicates purposeful movement, not aimless wandering.

This single verse showcases His sovereign timing, obedient heart, purposeful mission, and boundary-breaking grace, all pointing to the wider truth that the gospel is for every person, everywhere.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">He must needs go through Samaria</span>--i.e., following the shortest and most usual road, and the one we find Him taking from Galilee to Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/9-52.htm" title="And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.">Luke 9:52</a>; see Note there). Josephus spoke of this as the customary way of the Galileans going up during the feasts at Jerusalem (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 6, ? 1). The Pharisees, indeed, took the longer road through Peraea, to avoid contact with the country and people of Samaria, but it is within the purpose of His life and work ("needs go," <span class= "ital">i.e., was necessary that He should go</span>) to teach in Samaria, as in Judaea, the principles of true religion and worship, which would cut away the foundations of all local jealousies and feuds, and establish for all nations the spiritual service of the universal Father (<a href="/context/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21-24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he must needs go through Samaria.</span> There was no physical necessity about it. He might, as bigoted Jews were accustomed to do, have crossed the Jordan and passed through Peraea instead. There was no such animus in the heart of Jesus, and a Divine and providential monition was the occasion of his taking the direct road. Geikie has drawn a vivid picture of the difficulties to which Jewish travellers on the borders of Samaria were exposed (see <a href="/hosea/6-9.htm">Hosea 6:9</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:06. 1; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:12. 4; 'Vit.,' 52), and also of the physical features of the land. Samaria, as a name of the small district of central Palestine, arose from the name of the city "Samaria," built by Omri, and made the site of the kingdom of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>), and that of the Baal- and of the calf-worship. Samaria suffered from the siege, and the city was depopulated by Shalmanezer (Sargon), and colonized with Assyrians under Esarhaddon. It was destroyed by Hyrcanus, and rebuilt in splendour by Herod the Great, and by him dedicated to Augustus, and called <span class="accented">Sebaste</span> after him. Though Shechem (equivalent to Sichem) was the more famous site, and overshadowed Herod's city by its historical interest, yet "Samaria" was the name which has survived all others, and covered a larger space. Jesus was probably on the borders of Samaria, in the Judaean country, before he commenced his journey. Samaria was included in the tetrarchy of Archelaus, and formed part of the province under the pro-curatorship of Pontius Pilate; while Herod Antipas reigned over Galilee and Persia. The Lord was fulfilling the Divine will, in commencing his Galilaean ministry, in leaving Judaea proper for the present, and passing through Samaria. It is worthy of notice that John here attributes to "the Pharisees," rather than "the Jews," the opposition which indicated the wisdom or necessity of this course. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
