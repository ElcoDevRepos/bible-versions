It is a unique feature of Jesus' teaching style, underscoring the authority with which He speaks. The repetition of "truly" indicates the certainty and significance of the message that follows.<p><b>whoever receives the one I send</b><br>This refers to the apostles and disciples whom Jesus commissions to spread His teachings. The concept of being sent is rooted in the Jewish tradition of shaliach, where a messenger carries the authority of the one who sends them. This phrase highlights the continuity of Jesus' mission through His followers, emphasizing the importance of apostolic authority and the role of the Church in continuing Christ's work.<p><b>receives Me</b><br>Receiving Jesus' messengers is equated with receiving Jesus Himself. This reflects the intimate connection between Christ and His followers, as well as the unity of the body of Christ. It underscores the idea that the acceptance of the gospel message is tantamount to accepting Christ personally, a theme echoed in <a href="/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40</a>.<p><b>and whoever receives Me</b><br>This phrase reinforces the personal relationship between the believer and Jesus. It suggests that faith in Christ is not merely an intellectual assent but involves a personal acceptance and relationship. This is consistent with the Johannine emphasis on abiding in Christ (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>).<p><b>receives the One who sent Me.</b><br>This refers to God the Father, who sent Jesus into the world. The statement establishes a direct link between the acceptance of Jesus and the acceptance of God, highlighting the unity of the Father and the Son. It reflects the Trinitarian relationship and the divine mission of Jesus as the sent one, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>.

They are to go forth, then, and to be content if their path is as that which their Master has trodden. They are not to be disheartened by treachery even in their midst, for this He had foreseen. The words spoken when they were called to be Apostles still hold true. Their honour and encouragement is in the fact that <span class= "ital">they</span> are Apostles from Him, as He is an Apostle from the Father. This truth is one of those solemn utterances on which He would have them dwell, and is therefore introduced by "Verily, verily." (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>.) For the words, which are exactly the same as those of the first commission, comp.

The words reveal a claim to issue such commissions, and to confer upon his apostolic and other representatives something of his <span class="accented">own</span> dignity and glory, viz. the glory of sacrifice far others, the dignity of service. He may have intended: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> To comfort those who are bewildered by the thought of the treachery within their enclosure, and to assure them that such conduct on the part of an apostle must not be allowed to lower their estimate of apostolic duty. Certain ecclesiastical interpreters find here that the unworthiness even of Judas did not destroy the Divine character of his testimony, and that the immoral character of the minister now does not annul the commission he has received. This dogma is essentially hostile to the teaching of the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-21</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The royal power of the dying Christ; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the bold identification of his own claims with those of his Father. Few more wonderful sayings were uttered by Jesus, if we ponder the connection in which they stand; but let it be observed that we do <span class="accented">not</span> owe to the Fourth Gospel the <span class="accented">matter</span> of this saying. It must have been familiar to the readers of John from the solemn records of the Gospel of Matthew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
