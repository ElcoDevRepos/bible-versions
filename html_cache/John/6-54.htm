In the context of <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>, Jesus is speaking to a Jewish audience familiar with the Passover meal, which involved the eating of sacrificial lamb. The language of eating flesh and drinking blood would have been shocking, as consuming blood was strictly forbidden in Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>). However, Jesus uses this metaphor to indicate a deeper spiritual truth about participating in His life and sacrifice. This phrase foreshadows the Last Supper, where Jesus institutes the New Covenant in His blood (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>). It also connects to the idea of Jesus as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), emphasizing the necessity of a personal, sustaining relationship with Him.<p><b>has eternal life</b><br>Eternal life is a key theme in the Gospel of John, signifying not just an unending existence but a quality of life that begins now and continues into eternity. This life is characterized by a relationship with God through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). The present tense "has" indicates that eternal life is a current possession for believers, not just a future promise. This assurance is rooted in the believer's union with Christ, as symbolized by the eating and drinking metaphor. The concept of eternal life is also linked to the promises of the Old Testament, where life and blessing are associated with obedience to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>).<p><b>and I will raise him up at the last day</b><br>The promise of resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian hope. Jesus assures believers of their future resurrection, which is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>. The "last day" refers to the eschatological culmination of history, when Christ will return to judge the living and the dead (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>). This promise is reiterated multiple times in <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a> (verses 39, 40, 44), emphasizing its importance. The resurrection is both a physical and spiritual reality, affirming the Christian belief in the bodily resurrection of the dead. This assurance provides comfort and motivation for believers to live faithfully in anticipation of Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the necessity of spiritual sustenance through Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_followers.htm">Disciples and Followers</a></b><br>Those who are listening to Jesus' teaching, including His disciples and the broader group of followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The location where Jesus delivered this discourse, often considered His base during His Galilean ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_day.htm">The Last Day</a></b><br>Refers to the eschatological event when believers will be resurrected and receive eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_nourishment.htm">Spiritual Nourishment</a></b><br>Just as physical food sustains our bodies, Jesus' sacrifice sustains our spiritual lives.

The previous verse stated the condition without which they could not have life. This verse declares that they who thus eat and drink possess that life now, and that it is eternal. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/6-47.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.">John 6:47</a>.) The thought advances, too, from the "ye" of those immediately addressed to the "whoso," which has no limit but the fulfilment of the condition. The word for "eateth" is a stronger word than that before used, meaning literally the act of dividing the food by the teeth; but this meaning is not to be pressed. It is simply the present tense, which describes the process of eating, and is the same word which is used in <a href="/context/john/6-56.htm" title="He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.">John 6:56-58</a>, and in <a href="/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>.
