It highlights the ongoing nature of John's testimony about Jesus. The Gospel of John often uses time markers to structure the narrative, emphasizing the unfolding revelation of Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>John was there again</b><br>John the Baptist's presence is significant as he consistently points others to Jesus. His role as a forerunner is prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, preparing the way for the Lord. His steadfastness in his mission underscores his commitment to God's calling, serving as a model of faithfulness.<p><b>with two of his disciples</b><br>These disciples are later identified as Andrew and, likely, John the Apostle. The presence of disciples indicates that John the Baptist had a following, people who were committed to his message of repentance and preparation for the coming Messiah. This reflects the Jewish tradition of rabbinic discipleship, where students would learn from a teacher. The transition of these disciples from John to Jesus marks the shift from the old covenant to the new, as they recognize Jesus as the fulfillment of John's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A pivotal figure in the New Testament, John the Baptist is known for his role in preparing the way for Jesus Christ.

After proclaiming Jesus as &#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), John continues his ministry without pause.<p>- God often works in a series of purposeful days&#8212;creation (<a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>), Israel&#8217;s march around Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3&#8211;4</a>), and Jesus&#8217; own final week (<a href="/bsb/mark/11.htm">Mark 11&#8211;16</a>). Each &#8220;next day&#8221; signals progress in God&#8217;s unfolding plan.<p>- For the readers of John&#8217;s Gospel, this phrase anchors the narrative in real time, inviting us to see each day as an opportunity to point others to Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The steadfast witness: &#8220;John was there again&#8221;</b><p>- John the Baptist remains in the same place of ministry, illustrating perseverance (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p>- &#8220;Again&#8221; highlights consistency; yesterday&#8217;s faithful stand is repeated today (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p>- His unwavering presence contrasts with shifting crowds (<a href="/luke/7-24.htm">Luke 7:24&#8211;25</a>), underscoring the call to remain steadfast even when attention turns elsewhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Investing in disciples: &#8220;with two of his disciples&#8221;</b><p>- John does not minister alone; he&#8217;s pouring into future witnesses. One of these is Andrew (<a href="/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40</a>), who will soon bring Simon Peter to Jesus.<p>- Mentorship is woven through Scripture: Moses with Joshua (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>), Elijah with Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9</a>), Paul with Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p>- By staying &#8220;with&#8221; his disciples, John models relational discipleship&#8212;life shared, truth explained, hearts prepared for Jesus (<a href="/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>).<p>- The scene also shows humility; John willingly hands his disciples over to the Messiah when He appears (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/1-35.htm">John 1:35</a> captures more than a date stamp; it showcases daily faithfulness, steadfast presence, and intentional disciple-making.

Rather it is that, in that band of disciples too, there is an inner circle of those who, because they can receive more, are taught more. They had heard the words before, it may be had talked together about them, at least in individual thought had tried to follow them, and now they have come to the Teacher again. Can we doubt what questions fill the heart or shape themselves in word? He had passed through their struggle from darkness into light. There is a Presence with them which he now knows, and before which his own work must cease. The passing voice is no longer needed now that the abiding Word has come. Can we doubt what his answer is?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-51.</span> - 3. <span class="accented">The first disciples, and their testimony.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-39.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">John directs his own disciples to Jesus.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow, again John was standing, and two from his disciples;</span> implying that there were many others within hearing of his voice, or, at least, under his influence.

The "again" refers back to ver. 29.
