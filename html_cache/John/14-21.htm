In the Jewish tradition, the law was central to religious life, and Jesus' commandments are seen as a fulfillment and expansion of the Mosaic Law. The concept of keeping commandments is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where obedience to God's law was a sign of faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-9</a>). The New Testament continues this theme, with Jesus summarizing the law in the commandments to love God and love others (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>).<p><b>is the one who loves Me.</b><br>Love for Jesus is demonstrated through obedience. This reflects the covenant relationship seen throughout the Bible, where love and obedience are intertwined (1 <a href="/john/5-3.htm">John 5:3</a>). In the cultural context of the time, love was often expressed through actions rather than just emotions. This aligns with the Hebrew understanding of love as a commitment to act in accordance with God's will.<p><b>The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father,</b><br>This statement highlights the reciprocal nature of the relationship between believers, Jesus, and the Father. It echoes the covenantal promises found in the Old Testament, where God's love and favor are bestowed upon those who are faithful (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>). The Father&#8217;s love is a central theme in the New Testament, emphasizing the unity and shared purpose within the Trinity (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>and I will love him</b><br>Jesus' love is personal and active. This assurance of love is a promise of His ongoing presence and care. The love of Christ is a recurring theme in the New Testament, often linked with His sacrificial death and resurrection (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>). This love is transformative, leading believers into a deeper relationship with God.<p><b>and reveal Myself to him.&#8221;</b><br>Revelation here refers to a deeper understanding and experience of Jesus' nature and mission. This promise of revelation is fulfilled through the Holy Spirit, who guides believers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). The concept of revelation is significant in biblical prophecy, where God unveils His plans and purposes to His people. This personal revelation is part of the believer's spiritual growth and sanctification process.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, providing them with guidance and assurance of His love and presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who follow Christ's teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>Mentioned as the one who loves those who love Jesus, highlighting the divine relationship between the Father and the Son.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus shares His final teachings with His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/john/14.htm">John 14</a> includes Jesus' promise of the Holy Spirit, who aids believers in keeping His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/love_and_obedience.htm">Love and Obedience</a></b><br>True love for Jesus is demonstrated through obedience to His commandments.

To &#8220;have&#8221; His commandments means we have received, heard, and embraced what He has spoken. It echoes the psalmist&#8217;s confession, &#8220;I have hidden Your word in my heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>). The disciples already heard Jesus sum up all commandments in love for God and neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>), and He has just added the new command to love one another as He loved them (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>). When His words dwell in us&#8212;&#8220;If you remain in Me and My words remain in you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-7.htm">John 15:7</a>)&#8212;we truly possess them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and keeps them</b><p>Having is incomplete without keeping. To &#8220;keep&#8221; means to guard and obey, reflecting how Noah &#8220;did everything that God commanded him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>). Obedience is tangible proof of possession: &#8220;We know that we have come to know Him if we keep His commandments&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-4</a>). Keeping carries the idea of ongoing pattern, not momentary success. When we stumble, we confess and return, yet the overall direction of life is obedience (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is the one who loves Me</b><p>Jesus ties love to obedience, not mere sentiment. Genuine affection manifests in action, like Abraham offering Isaac (<a href="/james/2-21.htm">James 2:21-23</a>) or Mary pouring costly perfume (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>). Christ states plainly: &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>). Love is authenticated by obedience; obedience is animated by love. Neither is negotiable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father</b><p>Here Jesus assures a special experiential love from the Father toward obedient children. This is not about earning salvation&#8212;salvation is a gift (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>)&#8212;but about entering a deeper relational enjoyment of the Father&#8217;s affection. Similar language appears in <a href="/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a>: &#8220;The Father Himself loves you because you have loved Me.&#8221; As we walk in obedience, we feel the Father&#8217;s delight in tangible ways, enjoying what Jude calls &#8220;keeping yourselves in the love of God&#8221; (Jude 21).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will love him</b><p>Though Jesus already loves the whole world (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>), there is an intensified, personal expression reserved for obedient believers. Think of His unique affection for John, &#8220;the disciple whom Jesus loved&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-23.htm">John 13:23</a>), or for Mary, Martha, and Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-5.htm">John 11:5</a>). Obedience opens the door to deeper communion where Christ&#8217;s love is not only believed but continually experienced (<a href="/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and reveal Myself to him</b><p>The promise culminates in revelation. Jesus pledges ongoing self-disclosure&#8212;an ever-growing awareness of His character, presence, and purpose. After His resurrection He &#8220;opened their minds to understand the Scriptures&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>), and today He does the same through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>). As we walk in obedience, Scripture becomes clearer, prayer more intimate, and circumstances more obviously guided by His hand. This progressive unveiling anticipates the ultimate revelation when &#8220;we shall see Him as He is&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a> presents a beautiful progression: receiving Jesus&#8217; commands, living them out, and thereby demonstrating authentic love for Him. That love invites an enriched relationship marked by the Father&#8217;s delight, Christ&#8217;s personal affection, and ongoing revelations of His person. Obedience does not purchase salvation; it proves love and positions us to experience the fullness of divine fellowship promised to every faithful disciple.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">He that hath my commandments.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/14-15.htm" title="If you love me, keep my commandments.">John 14:15</a> and <a href="/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a>. This verse points out the successive degrees which led up to the full manifestation of Christ. The first step is the moral apprehension and practical observance of our Lord's commandments, which necessarily result from love to Christ.<p><span class= "bld">He it is that loveth me.</span>--The next step is the special receptivity of the Father's love which he who loves Christ possesses, and therefore there is a special sense in which the Father loves him. The words express with fulness of emphasis, "<span class= "ital">He</span> it is, and he only."<p><span class= "bld">And I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</span>--The special love of the Son follows from the special love of the Father, and is accompanied by the full manifestation of the Son. This is further explained in <a href="/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - Then for a moment he turns from the eleven, and stretches out his searching gaze and far-sweeping love to every one who <span class="cmt_word">hath my commandments</span> as a sure possession and lofty privilege and sufficient standard, <span class="cmt_word">and keepeth them</span>, thus proving that <span class="cmt_word">he it is that loveth me</span>; returning thus back to Ver. 15, where he said that love would induce and ought to compel to obedience; and he adds another and wonderful benediction: <span class="cmt_word">He will be loved by my Father</span>, in a sense more intense than that in which God is said to love the world (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). God the Father loves those who love the Son, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> love the object of his own superlative affection.
