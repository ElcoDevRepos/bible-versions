The imperative "Go" reflects His confidence and the immediacy of His response. This mirrors other instances in the Gospels where Jesus issues commands that result in miraculous outcomes, such as calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) or healing the paralytic (<a href="/mark/2-11.htm">Mark 2:11</a>). The use of a simple directive highlights Jesus' role as the sovereign Lord who speaks with the authority of God.<p><b>&#8220;Your son will live.&#8221;</b><br>This statement is a promise and a declaration of healing. It reflects Jesus' omniscience and His ability to perform miracles from a distance, showcasing His divine nature. The assurance "will live" indicates not just physical healing but also points to the life-giving power of Jesus, which is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). This phrase can be seen as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah bringing healing and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p><b>The man took Jesus at His word and departed.</b><br>The man's response demonstrates faith and trust in Jesus' words without requiring physical evidence. This act of faith is significant, as it aligns with the broader biblical theme that faith often precedes the realization of God's promises (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>). The man's belief in Jesus' word is reminiscent of Abraham's faith, who "believed the Lord, and He credited it to him as righteousness" (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). This trust in Jesus' spoken word underscores the importance of faith in the Christian life and the power of Jesus' words to effect change.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.

Jesus adopts in his gracious response the more dignified word which had been already on the lips of the father. He did not "need the passionate appeal" (Moulton). The <span class="accented">rationale</span> of the miracle is impossible. The will of Jesus was in absolute coincidence with the Divine will, and he knew, by the inward conformity of his own will with the Father's will, that what he willed the Father willed, and that at the very moment the crisis of the fever had passed and the change was wrought. On this occasion he did not say, "I will come and heal him," but, "Go; thy son liveth;" he is no longer, as thou thoughtest, on the point of death.
