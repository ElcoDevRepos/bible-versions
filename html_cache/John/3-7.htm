The term "amazed" suggests Nicodemus's surprise or confusion at Jesus' teaching. In the Jewish context, spiritual rebirth was not a common concept, and Nicodemus, as a learned teacher, would have been familiar with the Law and the Prophets but not with the idea of being "born again." This phrase indicates the radical nature of Jesus' message, which challenges traditional Jewish beliefs and emphasizes the need for spiritual transformation.<p><b>that I said</b><br>Jesus speaks with authority, indicating that His words carry divine weight. The phrase "that I said" underscores the personal nature of Jesus' teaching. In the Gospels, Jesus often uses direct speech to convey important truths, emphasizing His role as the ultimate teacher and revealer of God's will. This reflects the prophetic tradition where God's messengers deliver His words directly to the people.<p><b>&#8216;You must be born again.&#8217;</b><br>The concept of being "born again" is central to Christian theology, signifying a spiritual rebirth and transformation through faith in Jesus Christ. This idea is rooted in the Old Testament, where the prophets spoke of a new heart and spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>). The necessity of being "born again" highlights the insufficiency of mere physical birth or adherence to the Law for entering the Kingdom of God. It points to the need for a new creation, as Paul later elaborates in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>. This phrase also connects to the broader theme of regeneration and renewal found throughout the New Testament, emphasizing the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus about the necessity of spiritual rebirth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nicodemus.htm">Nicodemus</a></b><br>A Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council who comes to Jesus by night, seeking understanding of His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this conversation takes place, a significant location for Jewish religious life and Jesus' ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_birth.htm">The New Birth</a></b><br>The event or process Jesus describes, emphasizing a spiritual transformation necessary for entering the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/n/necessity_of_spiritual_rebirth.htm">Necessity of Spiritual Rebirth</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that being "born again" is not optional but essential for entering the Kingdom of God.

But there is a special application to the present case, "Marvel not that I said unto thee (teacher as thou art) that ye (children of Abraham as ye are) must be born again." In so far as they were children of Abraham according to the flesh, they were children of Abraham's physical and sinful nature. The law of that, as of all human nature, was that flesh ruled animal life, and animal life ruled spirit, and the whole man became carnal, bringing forth the fruits of the flesh. The law of the regenerate nature was that the spirit, born by the influence of the Divine Spirit, rose to a new life of communion with God, controlled the lower life, with its affections, feelings, and desires, and that these thus controlled became the motive power of the body; the whole man thus became spiritual, bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit. (Comp. Note on <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>.) For them, then, as for all, it was no matter of wonder, it was an absolute necessity of their true life, that they should be born anew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.</span> Nicodemus had revealed, by his expressions of countenance or unrecorded words, his surprise. This further explanation deepened the solemnity of the first assertion by a bold antithesis between the birth of flesh producing nothing but flesh, however high its culture, and the birth of spirit from the Spirit himself, the heavenly and Divine Originator of all genuine repentance, and the sole Cause of the new life. Nicodemus was clinging more and more eagerly to the old ideas of national privilege, of sacramental purification, of soundly taught principles and habits. He marvelled at such representation which took the heart out of all his previous training. The Messianic kingdom for which he had been looking and longing seemed to fade away in the clouds of an utter mysticism, and to vanish out of his power of recognition. Our Lord gently reproved the expression of his surprise, and reminded him of the previous utterance, "<span class="accented">I</span> said to <span class="accented">thee, Ye</span>," etc. Nicodemus had come in the name of others. Jesus replies, and reasserts the principles for the entire group of persons which Nicodemus might be supposed to represent. We must not fail to notice that, whereas in other parts of the discourse our Lord speaks in the plural first person, yet be discriminates himself from. others in this statement. He does not say, "<span class="accented">We must</span>," etc., but "<span class="accented">Ye must</span>," etc. He had no consciousness of personal need of regeneration, nor was <span class="accented">he</span> in the first case born as flesh from flesh. His flesh was itself the work of the Spirit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Do not be amazed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#952;&#945;&#965;&#956;&#940;&#963;&#8131;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(thaumas&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2296.htm">Strong's 2296: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) intrans: I wonder, marvel, (b) trans: I wonder at, admire.
