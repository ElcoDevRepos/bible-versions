It signifies the end of His physical presence on earth. This transition is crucial for the fulfillment of His mission, as it leads to the coming of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>). The phrase also reflects the temporary nature of Jesus' earthly ministry, emphasizing His eternal existence and divine mission.<p><b>but they are in the world</b><br>Here, Jesus acknowledges the continued presence of His disciples in a world that is often hostile to His teachings. This highlights the challenges and persecutions they will face (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>). The disciples are called to be in the world but not of it, maintaining their distinctiveness as followers of Christ (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>). This phrase underscores the need for divine protection and guidance as they carry out their mission.<p><b>and I am coming to You</b><br>This statement reflects Jesus' return to the Father, completing His earthly mission. It signifies His impending ascension and the restoration of His pre-incarnate glory (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). This return is essential for the sending of the Holy Spirit, who will empower the disciples to continue His work (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). It also fulfills the prophetic anticipation of the Messiah's exaltation (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>).<p><b>Holy Father</b><br>The use of "Holy Father" emphasizes the unique relationship between Jesus and God, highlighting God's purity and separateness from sin. This title reflects the intimate and reverent nature of Jesus' prayer. It also underscores the divine authority and power of God to protect and sanctify the disciples. The holiness of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, calling believers to a life of holiness (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>protect them by Your name</b><br>The name of God represents His character, authority, and power. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it conveyed the essence of a person. Jesus is asking for divine protection over His disciples, invoking the full authority and power of God. This protection is not just physical but spiritual, safeguarding their faith and unity. The name of God is a strong tower and refuge for believers (<a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>).<p><b>the name You gave Me</b><br>This phrase indicates the divine authority and mission given to Jesus by the Father. It reflects the unity and shared purpose between the Father and the Son. The name given to Jesus encompasses His role as Savior, Messiah, and Lord. It signifies the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). Jesus' name is above every name, and at His name, every knee will bow (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-10</a>).<p><b>so that they may be one as We are one</b><br>This prayer for unity among the disciples mirrors the perfect unity between the Father and the Son. It emphasizes the importance of love, harmony, and shared purpose within the body of Christ. This unity is a testimony to the world of the truth of the Gospel (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>). The oneness of believers is a reflection of the divine nature and is essential for the effective witness and mission of the church. This unity is a fulfillment of Jesus' prayer and a foretaste of the eternal unity believers will experience in the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prayer, Jesus is preparing for His crucifixion and is interceding for His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' prayer, representing all believers who will follow Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to the earthly realm where the disciples will remain after Jesus' ascension.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_father.htm">Holy Father</a></b><br>A title for God the Father, emphasizing His purity and the intimate relationship with Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unity.htm">Unity</a></b><br>The desired outcome of Jesus' prayer, reflecting the unity between the Father and the Son.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_unity.htm">The Importance of Unity</a></b><br>Jesus' prayer highlights the critical nature of unity among believers, reflecting the divine unity of the Trinity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>Jesus asks the Father to protect His followers, indicating the spiritual dangers present in the world and the need for divine safeguarding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_name.htm">The Power of God's Name</a></b><br>The name of God is a source of protection and identity for believers, signifying authority and relationship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_the_world.htm">Living in the World</a></b><br>While believers are in the world, they are not of it, and must navigate their faith amidst worldly challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prayer.htm">The Role of Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus models intercessory prayer, showing the importance of praying for others, especially for their spiritual well-being and unity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_17_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 17:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_17_11_Unity_s_importance_today.htm">How does John 17:11 emphasize the importance of unity among believers today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_name_s_role_in_believers_unity.htm">What role does God's name play in believers' unity in John 17:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_achieve_unity_as_Jesus_prayed.htm">How can we practically "be one" as Jesus prayed in John 17:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/John_17_11_Eph_4_3_Unity_connection.htm">How does John 17:11 connect with Ephesians 4:3 on maintaining unity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_church_leaders_promote_unity.htm">In what ways can church leaders foster unity as Jesus prayed in John 17:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_that_they_may_be_one.htm">What does "that they may be one as we are" mean in John 17:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_17_11_show_unity.htm">How does John 17:11 support the concept of Christian unity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_seek_protection_in_John_17_11.htm">Why does Jesus pray for protection in John 17:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_17.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_pray_to_god.htm">Why did Jesus communicate with God through prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_divine_wisdom_and_unity.htm">What is the nature of divine wisdom and unity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'kept_by_god's_power'_mean.htm">What does "Kept by the Power of God" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_can_psalm_17_15_and_exodus_33_20_align.htm">If Psalm 17:15 suggests seeing God's face, how does that reconcile with passages stating no one can see God and live (Exodus 33:20)?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 17:11 Mean</div><b>I will no longer be in the world</b><p>&#8226; Jesus states a literal, imminent departure.

The earthly ministry is over; for a while he must leave them in the pitiless storm, bereft of his care and counsel, exposed to infinite peril and temptation.

This grand title stands here in solitary grandeur (though let Ver. 25, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>, be noticed, and the fact that <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a> speaks of "the Holy and True," and <a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a> of "the Holy One"). The very holiness of the Father is appealed to as the surest basis of the petition. They have already been taught to pray, "Hallowed [made holy] be thy Name." The eternal holiness and righteousness of God is involved in the saving and sanctification of the believer in Jesus. "<span class="accented">Keep</span> them, holy Father" (says our Lord), <span class="cmt_word">in and by thy Name, those whom thou hast given me.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is the reading of the T.R., on the very feeble authority from the codices, simply D2, 69, and some versions. It is also thus quoted by Epiphanius twice; but the reading of all the best uncial manuscripts, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, L, Y, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x394;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3a0;</span>, etc., numerous versions and quotations, is <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. Some very unimportant manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span>, which Godet prefers as practically equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x7b;&#x3c2;</span>, regarded as a unity, "that which," and as calculated to explain the <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span> of the uncials, and the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;</span>. Lachmann, Tischendorf (8th edit.), Tregelles, Meyer, Westcott and Herr, and R.T. all read <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span>, which is thrown by attraction to <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> into the dative, and requires the translation, <span class="cmt_word">Keep them</span> (<span class="accented">in</span> or <span class="accented">by</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in the power of thy Name which thou hast given me</span>. And since <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span> is a resolution of the attraction, it is quite as likely that <span class="accented">it</span> is a correction of <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span> as that the reverse process should have taken place. The expression is very peculiar, but not inexplicable. <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a> is the best illustration of the clause. It reads, according to the true text, "<span class="accented">He</span> hath bestowed on him the Name (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) which is above every name," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the eternal Name, the incommunicable Name (cf. <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>) of Jehovah. Meyer objects to this that the Father's Name was simply given him as an ambassador or for purposes of revelation and manifestation. This may be a partial limitation of the thought. He has already said, "<span class="accented">I</span> have manifested thy Name, thy fatherhood to the men," etc. And now he adds, "<span class="accented">Keep</span> them in the power and grace of this glorious Name, of which my Person and message have been the full expression." <span class="cmt_word">That they may be one</span>, united, formed into a unity of being, <span class="cmt_word">even as we are</span>, not losing their personality, but blending and interchanging their interests and their affections after the Divine pattern of the Father and Son. The relations between Christians, which constitute the essential unity of their corporate being, are of the same kind as those which pertain to Christ and God, and prevail between them, therefore lying far behind the shifting phases of organization and human order, in the essence and substance of spiritual life. Some writers have found in this analogy between the union of believers and the hypostatic union of the Persons of the Godhead, either a species of tritheism in the Godhead, or a minimizing of the entire conception to what is called moral union between the Father-God and his Son Jesus Christ. But the effect of the utterance is rather to lift the idea of the unity of the body of Christ to a superlative height, and to interpret still further the nature of its oneness with the Father and Son (see Ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/17-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I will no longer be</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#956;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(eimi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
