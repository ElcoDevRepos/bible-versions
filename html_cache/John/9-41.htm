The term "blind" here is metaphorical, referring to spiritual blindness or ignorance. In biblical times, blindness was often seen as a physical ailment that rendered a person helpless, symbolizing a lack of understanding or insight. Jesus uses this metaphor to address the Pharisees' inability to recognize Him as the Messiah. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>, where the Messiah is prophesied to open the eyes of the blind, both physically and spiritually.<p><b>&#8220;you would not be guilty of sin.&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus suggests that if the Pharisees were truly ignorant of their spiritual state, they would not be held accountable for their sin. This reflects a biblical principle found in <a href="/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>, where unintentional sin is treated differently from willful disobedience. The concept of accountability is central in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>, which states that knowing the right thing to do and failing to do it is sin.<p><b>But since you claim you can see,</b><br>The Pharisees prided themselves on their knowledge of the Law and their spiritual insight. Their claim to "see" indicates their self-righteousness and confidence in their own understanding. This is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12</a>, which warns about the danger of being wise in one's own eyes. The Pharisees' claim contrasts with the humility required to truly understand spiritual truths, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, where Jesus blesses the poor in spirit.<p><b>your guilt remains.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus concludes by stating that their guilt remains because they refuse to acknowledge their spiritual blindness. This is a direct indictment of their hypocrisy and rejection of Jesus as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The concept of remaining in guilt is tied to the idea of unrepentance and hardness of heart, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>. The Pharisees' persistent unbelief and rejection of Jesus' message leave them in a state of condemnation, as highlighted in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>, where people love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees, challenging their spiritual blindness and self-righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

True sight begins with humble dependence on the Light sent from the Father.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">If ye were blind, ye should have no sin.</span>--His answer is that He does not place them among those who are in this second sense blind. If they were among those "which see not" they would be conscious of their blindness, and would seek for spiritual light. They would ask, "Who is He, Lord, that we may believe on Him?" and would not ask in vain. In that case their present rejection of Him would arise from ignorance willing to be overcome, and this ignorance, not being wilful, would not be sin. Conscious ignorance would be the first step towards knowledge.<p><span class= "bld">But now ye say, We see.</span>--Their true place is among those who were spiritually blind, and were unconscious of it, "they which see," they which think they see." For them the first step towards true spiritual light must be a consciousness of blindness. As it is, as long as they think that they see, there is no ground for hope. (Comp. <a href="/context/matthew/9-12.htm" title="But when Jesus heard that, he said to them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.">Matthew 9:12-13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Therefore your sin remaineth.</span>--The word "therefore" should probably be omitted. The words "Your sin remaineth," or better, <span class= "ital">Your sin abideth</span> (comp. Note on <a href="/john/3-36.htm" title="He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.">John 3:36</a>), stand alone in their awful solemnity. They stand side by side with "Ye say, We see." The two states are one. The assertion of spiritual knowledge and independence was the original cause of sin (<a href="/genesis/3-4.htm" title="And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die:">Genesis 3:4</a>), and while spiritual pride exists sin cannot cease.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - The reply of our Lord is not meant to be a crushing and final retort, condemning them to hopeless night, but was obviously intended to show them that they are not yet free from <span class="accented">sin</span>, that they are only partially appreciating the light which shines upon them. <span class="cmt_word">If ye were blind</span> - incapable of sight; if ye had all along been deprived of the faculty of perceiving the true Light that shineth in the darkness (a condition of things which would have emancipated them from responsibility, and which Christ would not admit to be the case); perhaps more, if ye had been utterly blind to the light which is shining upon you now, which, however, is not true - <span class="cmt_word">ye would not have sin</span>. This is akin to the solemn language of <a href="/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22-24</a>. They did not themselves admit that there was any congenital blindness about them. They did not pretend or expect to ride off on such a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, such an excuse. Could they be, judicially or naturally, blind? The very idea was an absurdity, and so Jesus added, <span class="cmt_word">But now ye say, We see.</span> You even boast that you are "instructors of the ignorant, and leaders of the blind; a light to those who sit in darkness, having the form of knowledge and truth in the Law" (<a href="/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-21</a>).

What is the issue? The Lord seems to pause before his answer (the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, "therefore," is rejected by the best manuscripts and critics): <span class="cmt_word">Your sin abideth</span>; or, <span class="accented">remaineth</span>. It will remain until you fully admit the great principle and reason, the motive and characteristics, of my mission. The very facility you profess, the intimacy you claim with the Law and its founder, and your partial knowledge of my claim, take away your excuse.
