It reflects a natural curiosity and a desire to understand the miraculous event they have just witnessed. In the broader biblical context, this question echoes the human quest for understanding and seeking God, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart." The question also highlights the physical absence of Jesus at this moment, which is significant in the narrative as it emphasizes the personal encounter the man had with Jesus, rather than a public spectacle. This moment foreshadows the later spiritual seeking of Jesus after His resurrection, as seen in <a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a> when Mary Magdalene asks, "Where have you taken Him?"<p><b>I do not know,</b><br>The man's response indicates his limited understanding and knowledge of Jesus at this point. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where individuals initially encounter Jesus without fully comprehending His identity or mission. It parallels the journey of faith many believers experience, starting with an encounter with Jesus and growing into deeper understanding and relationship. This phrase also underscores the man's honesty and humility, traits that are often highlighted in Scripture as valuable, such as in <a href="/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>, "When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom." The man's lack of knowledge about Jesus' whereabouts also serves to focus the narrative on the miracle itself and the transformation it brought about, rather than on Jesus' physical presence.<p><b>he answered.</b><br>The man's response is straightforward and factual, emphasizing his role as a witness to the miracle. This aligns with the biblical theme of testimony, where individuals are called to bear witness to the works of God, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, "You will be my witnesses." His answer also sets the stage for the subsequent investigation by the Pharisees, highlighting the tension between the miraculous works of Jesus and the skepticism of the religious leaders. This tension is a recurring theme in the Gospels, illustrating the conflict between the new covenant Jesus brings and the established religious order. The man's testimony, though simple, becomes a powerful declaration of Jesus' divine power and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>Previously blind from birth, he was healed by Jesus, which sparked curiosity and questioning among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_neighbors_and_those_who_had_seen_him.htm">The Neighbors and Those Who Had Seen Him</a></b><br>These individuals were familiar with the blind man's condition and were astonished by his healing, prompting them to inquire about Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this event, He performed the miracle of healing the blind man, demonstrating His divine power and authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event took place, a significant location for many of Jesus' teachings and miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, they play a crucial role in the surrounding account, questioning the legitimacy of the miracle and Jesus' authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_testimony.htm">The Power of Testimony</a></b><br>The healed man's simple testimony, "I do not know," reflects honesty and humility.

Their words echo the earlier scene in <a href="/john/7-11.htm">John 7:11</a>, &#8220;The Jews were looking for Him at the feast and saying, &#8216;Where is He?&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8211; They are focused on finding His physical location, yet Scripture often uses the search for Christ to illustrate the deeper pursuit of truth (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Even today, curiosity about Jesus can open the door to saving faith when that search is pursued sincerely.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they asked</b><p>&#8211; The former beggar is now surrounded by questioners. Their inquiry fulfills the pattern of witnesses gathering after a divine act (<a href="/mark/2-12.htm">Mark 2:12</a>; <a href="/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38</a>).<p>&#8211; Notice how the community is drawn into the miracle&#8217;s ripple effect:<p>&#8226; Some are skeptical, needing evidence.<p>&#8226; Some are hopeful, wondering if the long-promised Messiah has appeared.<p>&#8211; God often uses public questions to spotlight His works and invite testimony (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I do not know,</b><p>&#8211; The man&#8217;s honesty is refreshing. Like his later confession, &#8220;One thing I do know, I was blind and now I see&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-25.htm">John 9:25</a>), he sticks to the facts.<p>&#8211; New believers may not have every answer; Scripture shows that growth is progressive (<a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>).<p>&#8211; His humility aligns with Paul&#8217;s reminder that even former blasphemers receive mercy despite limited understanding (<a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he answered</b><p>&#8211; Though he lacks information, he still responds. Silence would have hidden the miracle; a fabricated story would have corrupted it.<p>&#8211; This simple reply models faithful witness:<p>&#8226; Speak what you know (<a href="/john/4-29.htm">John 4:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Refuse to embellish (<a href="/proverbs/30-6.htm">Proverbs 30:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Let the facts point others to Christ (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>).<p>&#8211; The man&#8217;s testimony sets the stage for Jesus to reveal Himself more fully in the verses that follow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-12.htm">John 9:12</a> captures the immediate aftermath of sight restored: people searching, questions swirling, and a brand-new believer giving an honest, uncluttered answer.
