This sorrow is reflective of the human condition when faced with loss and uncertainty. The context here is the Last Supper, where Jesus is preparing His disciples for His crucifixion. The sorrow is not just personal but also communal, as they are about to witness the suffering of their teacher and friend. This moment is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "a man of sorrows."<p><b>but I will see you again</b><br>This phrase is a promise of Jesus' resurrection. The assurance that He will see them again points to the temporary nature of their sorrow. The resurrection is central to Christian faith, as it confirms Jesus' victory over death and His divine nature. This promise is also a precursor to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God will wipe away every tear, and there will be no more death or mourning.<p><b>and your hearts will rejoice</b><br>The joy that Jesus promises is profound and transformative. It is not merely an emotional response but a deep-seated joy that comes from the assurance of His victory over sin and death. This joy is a fulfillment of the joy prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>, where the redeemed will return with everlasting joy. The disciples' joy is also a type of the joy that believers experience through the Holy Spirit, as described in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>.<p><b>and no one will take away your joy</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the permanence and security of the joy that Jesus provides. Unlike worldly happiness, which is fleeting and dependent on circumstances, the joy given by Christ is eternal and unassailable. This assurance is echoed in <a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>, where Paul declares that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.

The hour of their travail-pangs was at hand; but it would pass away, and the fulness of joy would come in the constant presence of their Lord. Their sorrow would be but temporary; their joy would be abiding. The point of comparison between their state, and the familiar illustration of a woman in travail, is the passage from extreme suffering to extreme joy. We are not justified in taking the illustration as a parable, and interpreting it of the death of Christ as the birth-pang of a perfect humanity. This is the general interpretation of the more mystical expositors, and has been unfolded with great truth and beauty; but it is not an exposition of the present text.<p><span class= "bld">But I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice.</span>--In <a href="/john/16-19.htm" title="Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me?">John 16:19</a> He had said "Ye shall see." This is the obverse of the same truth. He will again. be with them, and see them as they will see Him. The words include too the thought of His deep sympathy with them.
