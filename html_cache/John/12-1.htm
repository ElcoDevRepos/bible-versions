The timing is significant as it marks the beginning of the final week of Jesus' earthly ministry, leading to His crucifixion. Passover is a time of pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and many Jews would be traveling to the city, heightening the anticipation and tension surrounding Jesus' actions and teachings. The Passover lamb, central to the festival, is a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who would soon be sacrificed for the sins of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>Jesus came to Bethany</b><br>Bethany is a small village located about two miles east of Jerusalem, on the southeastern slope of the Mount of Olives. It served as a place of refuge and rest for Jesus during His visits to Jerusalem. The village is significant in Jesus' ministry, as it is the home of His close friends Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. Bethany's proximity to Jerusalem made it a strategic location for Jesus to stay during the Passover week, allowing Him to enter the city each day and return to a place of safety and support.<p><b>the hometown of Lazarus</b><br>Lazarus is a key figure in the Gospel of John, particularly known for being raised from the dead by Jesus in <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>. This miracle is one of the most significant signs in John's Gospel, demonstrating Jesus' power over death and foreshadowing His own resurrection. Lazarus' resurrection also serves as a catalyst for the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion, as it intensified the Jewish leaders' desire to kill Him (<a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>). The mention of Lazarus here reminds readers of Jesus' authority and the growing tension between Him and the religious authorities.<p><b>whom He had raised from the dead</b><br>This phrase highlights the miraculous power of Jesus and His authority over life and death. The raising of Lazarus is a pivotal event that not only demonstrates Jesus' divine nature but also serves as a testament to His claim of being the "resurrection and the life" (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). This miracle is a precursor to Jesus' own resurrection and is a powerful testament to His identity as the Son of God. It also underscores the theme of belief and unbelief, as many who witnessed the miracle believed in Jesus, while others reported it to the Pharisees, leading to increased opposition against Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is preparing for His final week leading to the crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>A village near Jerusalem, significant as the home of Lazarus, Mary, and Martha, and a place where Jesus often visited.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>A close friend of Jesus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead, demonstrating His power over life and death.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A major Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, symbolizing deliverance and redemption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Jesus' arrival in Bethany marks the beginning of the events leading up to His crucifixion, highlighting His deliberate journey towards fulfilling His mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_sacrifice.htm">Preparation for Sacrifice</a></b><br>Jesus' arrival in Bethany six days before Passover signifies His readiness to fulfill His role as the sacrificial Lamb.

A once-decaying body now eats dinner with Jesus&#8212;undeniable evidence that fuels both faith and opposition (<a href="/john/12-10.htm">John 12:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reassures readers that Christ&#8217;s power over death is historic fact. If He can call Lazarus out, He can walk out of His own tomb (<a href="/john/20-1.htm">John 20:1-9</a>).<p>&#8226; By placing the resurrection story just before the Passion narrative, John shows that triumphant life precedes sacrificial death, hinting at the empty tomb to come (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>; <a href="/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a> anchors the final week of Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry in concrete time, place, and people.

The discussion of this is reserved for a separate Note, where it may be fully dealt with. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Excursus F: The Day of the Crucifixion of our Lord.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">The feast of love and gratitude</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore, six days before the Passover.</span> Every preliminary of that solemn feast is memorable to our evangelist. The coincidence of the Passover feast and the killing of the Paschal lamb, with the sacrifice of "Christ our Passover," cannot be concealed. [For the grammatical construction with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span>, cf. note, <a href="/john/11-18.htm">John 11:18</a>, where a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> occurs; not, however, a Latinism, as some have supposed, as similar phrases are found in good Greek (see Winer, ' Greek Gram.,' p. 69).] The date from which the calculation is made is complicated with the intricate controversy upon the day of our Lord's death, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether he suffered on the 14th or 15th of Nisan, and whether a "harmony" is possible or not with the statements of the synoptists, who all three assert that our Lord ate the Passover with his disciples (see Introduction, pp. 92-94.). However this matter be finally settled, if the 14th of Nisan was the day on which the Passover was killed, "between the evenings," the 13th was reckoned as the first day before the Passover, and the sixth day would be the 8th of Nisan. If the weekly sabbath occurred on the 16th, then the 9th also was a sabbath. The Lord would then have reached Bethany on the <span class="accented">eve</span> of the sabbath, and have rested on the sabbath itself. The evening of the 9th would be the occasion of the feast, and the 10th would correspond with Palm Sunday. If the Lord were crucified on the 14th, and the weekly sabbath coincided with the Passover-day of convocation, the 15th, then the previous sabbath was on the 8th, and our Lord must have reached Bethany in "the end of the sabbath," and then the feast was on the following day. When Jesus halted at Bethany, the vast crowd of pilgrims advanced into the suburbs of Jerusalem, encamping on the Mount of Olives, and would be ready for the great demonstration of the next day. Westcott, after Bengel, observes that John's Gospel begins and ends with a sacred week (cf. <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-35, 43</a>; <a href="/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1</a>). <span class="accented">Jesus therefore, sis days before the Passover, <span class="cmt_word"></span>came to Bethany</span>. The quiet rest of that last sabbath with the family at Bethany is a thought full of suggestion. Thoma accounts for the triumphal feast and anointing, "six days before the Passover," as answering to the day on which the lamb was separated from other and secular animals, and consecrated for this holy service (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>). The segregation, however, was partial or premature, and the anointing (see below) took place five days before the Passover. It is not said that the day of his arrival at Bethany is the day of the festive welcome. Bethany is described as <span class="cmt_word">the place where Lazarus was.</span> The explanatory clause, <span class="cmt_word">he who had been dead</span>, is not necessary, as the evangelist limits and explains sufficiently the great motive for his pause and presence at Bethany by adding, <span class="cmt_word">whom he</span> (Jesus) <span class="cmt_word">raised from the dead.</span> It is extraordinary that some most able expositors should be so unwilling to accept the synchronous statements of the synoptists. Their narrative is not out of harmony with the hypothesis that our Lord passed the previous days with the pilgrim-band from Peraea, and that, taking the head of the procession as it was passing through Jericho., he should thus have distinctly challenged the authorities, and taken up the public position to which they were anxious he should lay claim. By his visit to the house of Zacchaeus he proclaimed the new feature and spirit of his kingdom; by healing the blind man he gave a typical illustration of the work of grace needed by all his disciples; by resting at the home where human love and Divine power had been so wonderfully blended he called the most solemn attention to his supreme claims; by pressing on with urgency up the steep mountain pathway at the head of his disciples he seemed to be ready, in his own words, "to lay down his life, that he might take it again." The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, according to Meyer, is simply the resumption of the narrative, but surely those are right who regard it as a distinct reference to <a href="/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55</a>. The Sanhedrists had given the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> that if any knew where he was, they should declare it. Christ was resolved, now that his hour was come, to lift the whole responsibility from his friends, and <span class="accented">take</span> it upon himself. The other evangelists do not mention the halt. Their purpose was not a chronological one. They give the narrative of the anointing apart from its deepest meanings and consequences, apart from any references to Lazarus (see <a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6-12</a>; <a href="/mark/14-1.htm">Mark 14:1-11</a>). There are other subtle omissions from the synoptists, the difficulties of which must be settled as <span class="accented">between themselves</span>. Thus, according to <a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a> and 20, an interval of a whole day and night took place between the withering of the fig tree and the conversation about it, but Matthew makes the conversation follow immediately upon the miracle. In like manner, John abstains from any reference to the discussions in the temple, to the withering of the fig tree, to the cleansing of the temple, or to the parables which followed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Six</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7955;&#958;</span> <span class="translit">(hex)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Genitive Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1803.htm">Strong's 1803: </a> </span><span class="str2">Six.
