This site is traditionally identified as the place where John the Baptist conducted his ministry of baptism. The geographical reference to "beyond the Jordan" indicates a location on the eastern side of the Jordan River, which is in present-day Jordan. This area is rich in biblical history, as it is near where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>). The choice of this location for John's baptizing work is symbolic, as it represents a new beginning and a call to repentance, paralleling the Israelites' entry into a new life in the Promised Land. The site is also associated with Elijah, who was taken up to heaven nearby (<a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8-11</a>), and this connection underscores John's role as a prophetic figure in the spirit of Elijah (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>).<p><b>where John was baptizing</b><br>John the Baptist's ministry of baptism was a call to repentance and preparation for the coming Messiah. Baptism, as practiced by John, was a symbolic act of purification and a public declaration of repentance. It was distinct from the Jewish ritual washings, which were more about ceremonial cleanliness. John's baptism was a radical call to moral and spiritual renewal, preparing the way for Jesus Christ (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>). The act of baptizing in the Jordan River also evokes the imagery of cleansing and renewal, as the river was a boundary between the wilderness and the Promised Land. John's role as the forerunner to Christ is emphasized by his baptizing work, which set the stage for Jesus' own baptism and the beginning of His public ministry (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). John's message and baptism were a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and a type of the greater baptism that Jesus would bring through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/mark/1-8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>; <a href="/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A pivotal figure in the New Testament, John the Baptist was a prophet who prepared the way for Jesus Christ.

In the flow of the chapter, priests and Levites have just questioned John the Baptist about his identity (<a href="/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19-27</a>). The phrase underlines that the conversation, the testimony, and everything surrounding it truly occurred. Scripture repeatedly stresses the eyewitness nature of these reports&#8212;&#8220;what we have seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>), and &#8220;we did not follow cleverly devised tales&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>). Luke gives similar historical anchors when he lists leaders in <a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1-2</a>. By opening with &#8220;All this happened,&#8221; John stakes his claim on verifiable history and invites us to trust the narrative (<a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at Bethany</b><p>The Bethany mentioned here is not the village near Jerusalem where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived (<a href="/john/11-1.htm">John 11:1</a>). This Bethany lay in the wilderness region&#8212;quiet, removed from the religious center&#8212;so crowds had to leave their comfort zones to hear God&#8217;s messenger. Such a setting reminds us that God often speaks away from the noise: Elijah heard Him on Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>), and Israel met Him in the desert (<a href="/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1-6</a>). The two Bethanys highlight how carefully the Gospel writers locate events; John later names the other Bethany when recording Lazarus&#8217;s resurrection (<a href="/john/11-18.htm">John 11:18</a>), showing he knew the distinction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>beyond the Jordan</b><p>&#8220;Beyond&#8221; points to the east side of the river, the region where Israel once camped before crossing into the Promised Land (<a href="/bsb/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3-4</a>). That backdrop carries rich symbolism:<p>&#8226; Israel crossed the Jordan to begin a new life; John calls people across the river to a fresh start through repentance.<p>&#8226; Elijah and Elisha crossed the Jordan before Elijah was taken up (<a href="/2_kings/2-6.htm">2 Kings 2:6-13</a>); John ministers in the same area while preparing people for the One who would ascend and send the Spirit (<a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13, 31</a>-34).<p>&#8226; The wilderness recalls <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;A voice of one calling in the wilderness, &#8216;Prepare the way for the Lord.&#8217;&#8221; <a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1-3</a> and <a href="/mark/1-3.htm">Mark 1:3</a> apply that prophecy to John&#8217;s ministry, underscoring that the location fulfills Scripture.<p>John later returns &#8220;again to the place where John had first been baptizing, across the Jordan&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40</a>), confirming the site&#8217;s significance as a recurring gathering point when people seek truth apart from the establishment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where John was baptizing</b><p>John&#8217;s baptism marked repentance and anticipation of Messiah (<a href="/matthew/3-5.htm">Matthew 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/luke/3-3.htm">Luke 3:3-6</a>). Standing in the water, he preached the necessity of turning from sin and pointed forward to Christ&#8217;s superior work&#8212;&#8220;He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>). By situating baptism outside Jerusalem, John signaled that cleansing is granted by God, not by temple rituals (<a href="/acts/13-24.htm">Acts 13:24</a>). Crowds who submitted to the rite acknowledged their need; the same humility opens hearts to Jesus, whom John introduced the very next day: &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). Later, Paul encounters disciples who had only known &#8220;John&#8217;s baptism&#8221; and brings them to full faith in Jesus (<a href="/acts/19-3.htm">Acts 19:3-5</a>), showing that John&#8217;s act was preparatory, not complete in itself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a> grounds the Gospel story in time and space&#8212;real events (&#8220;All this happened&#8221;), a specific locale (&#8220;at Bethany&#8221;), a symbolic setting (&#8220;beyond the Jordan&#8221;), and a purposeful activity (&#8220;where John was baptizing&#8221;). Every element directs our attention to God&#8217;s faithful unfolding plan: He raises a prophet in the wilderness, calls people to repentance, and positions everything so the Lamb of God can be clearly seen. The verse invites us to trust Scripture&#8217;s historical accuracy and, more importantly, to follow the path John points out&#8212;turn from sin and look to Christ for the true baptism of the Spirit and the new life only He provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Bethabara beyond Jordan</span> should be, <span class= "ital">Bethany beyond Jordan.</span> Origen found "Bethany" in "almost all the copies," but not being able to find the place, he came to the conclusion that it must be Bethabara which he heard of, with a local tradition that John had baptised there; and in this he is followed by the Fathers generally. In support of this the etymology of Bethabara (= "ford-house") is compared with a possible meaning of Bethany (= "ship-house"), and the two are regarded as popular names of some well-known ford, one of which gradually ceased to be known as the name of this place, because it became appropriated as a name of the Bethany made prominent in the closing scenes of our Lord's life. On the other hand, it is believed that this argument from etymology is at least precarious; that ignorance of the place after three hundred years--and these years of war and unsettlement--is not unnatural; that the tradition in favour of Bethabara, which was then a favourite place for baptism, is one likely to have grown with this fact; and that we are not justified in adopting the critical decision of Origen, who rejected the almost unanimous evidence of MSS. in favour of this tradition at second hand. We are, moreover, ignorant of the site of Bethabara, and the identification with either Beth-barah (<a href="/judges/7-24.htm" title="And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan.">Judges 7:24</a>), or Beth-nimrah (<a href="/numbers/32-36.htm" title="And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.">Numbers 32:36</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-27.htm" title="And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.">Joshua 13:27</a>), which in some readings of the LXX. had taken the forms <span class= "ital">Bethabra</span> and <span class= "ital">Betharaba,</span> gives a position much too far to the south, for the writer is clearly speaking of a place within easy approach of Galilee (<a href="/john/1-43.htm" title="The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.">John 1:43</a> and <a href="/john/2-1.htm" title="And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:">John 2:1</a>), and he is careful to note the succession of days and even hours. It is not inconsistent with this that the narrative in <a href="/matthew/3-5.htm" title="Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,">Matthew 3:5</a> and <a href="/mark/1-5.htm" title="And there went out to him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.">Mark 1:5</a> seems to require a place of easy access from Jerusalem, for the positions are not necessarily the same, and the account there is of a general impression, while here we have the minute details of an eye-witness. Himself a disciple of John, he remembers the place where he was then dwelling and baptising, and he knows that this Bethany is "beyond Jordan," just as he knows that the other is "the town of Mary and her sister Martha" (<a href="/john/11-1.htm" title="Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.">John 11:1</a>), and that it "was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off (<a href="/john/11-18.htm" title="Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:">John 11:18</a>). Dr. Caspari believes that a "Bethany" answering the demands of the context is to be found in the village <span class= "ital">Tellanije</span> or <span class= "ital">Tellanihje,</span> which is in the Iolan to the north of the Sea of Galilee (comp. <a href="/john/10-40.htm" title="And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed.">John 10:40</a>). It is near a ford of the Jordan, with several brooks intervening. The identity of name depends upon the frequent substitution by the Arabs of "Tell" (= "hill") for "Beth" (="house"), so that the present word represents Beth-anije, or Bethany. Dr. Caspari's statement is now accessible to the English reader. Few, perhaps, will fully accept the author's opinion, "With regard to the accuracy of our conclusion respecting the site, there can, therefore, be no doubt" (<span class= "ital">Chron. and Geogr., Introd.,</span> p. 93), but it is based upon a reading of which there can be no doubt, and is, at least, a probable interpretation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was</span> <span class="cmt_word">baptizing</span>. The fact that John the Baptist, in the previous verses, recognizes the Messiah, and that in vers. 31-33 he declares that knowledge to have followed the baptism and the sign then given to him, makes it obvious that the baptism and the forty days of the temptation are now in the past. Every day is clearly marked from the day on which the deputation from the Sanhedrin approached him, till we find Jesus at Cana, on his way to Jerusalem. Consequently, the baptism of Christ, which was the occasion of the higher knowledge that John acquired concerning him, as well as the temptation, had been consummated. Of this last it would seem highly probable John had received, in subsequent conversation with the Lord, a full report. The Lord had passed through the fiery ordeal. He had accepted the position of the Servant of the Lord, who, in the way of privation, suffering, fierce antagonism from world, flesh, and devil, would win the crown of victory and prove himself to be the Life and Light of the world. This chronological hint appears to me to explain the sudden and surprising utterance of the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">All this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Tauta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">happened</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(egeneto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
