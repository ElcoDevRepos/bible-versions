The meal signifies fellowship and restoration, a common theme in Jesus' post-resurrection appearances. Meals in Jewish culture were significant for community and reconciliation.<p><b>Jesus asked Simon Peter</b><br>Jesus addresses Peter directly, indicating a personal and intimate conversation. This is significant as Peter had previously denied Jesus three times. The use of Peter's original name, Simon, may suggest a return to foundational identity and calling.<p><b>Simon son of John</b><br>The use of Peter's full name emphasizes the seriousness of the moment. It recalls Peter's initial calling and identity, grounding him in his heritage and past, while preparing him for future responsibility.<p><b>do you love Me more than these?</b><br>This question is layered with meaning. "More than these" could refer to the other disciples, the fishing equipment, or Peter's previous life. It challenges Peter to evaluate his priorities and affections. The Greek word for love here is "agape," indicating a selfless, sacrificial love.<p><b>Yes, Lord,</b><br>Peter's response is immediate and affirmative, showing his recognition of Jesus' authority and his desire to affirm his loyalty. The term "Lord" acknowledges Jesus' divine authority and Peter's submission to it.<p><b>he answered, &#8220;You know I love You.&#8221;</b><br>Peter uses the Greek word "phileo," indicating a brotherly love, which may suggest a humbler acknowledgment of his affection compared to the "agape" love Jesus asked about. This reflects Peter's awareness of his previous failures and his reliance on Jesus' knowledge of his heart.<p><b>Jesus replied, &#8220;Feed My lambs.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus commissions Peter to pastoral care, symbolized by "lambs," representing new or vulnerable believers. This charge signifies restoration and trust, as well as a call to leadership and service. It echoes the imagery of Jesus as the Good Shepherd and fulfills the prophecy of Peter's role in the early church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ, who is reaffirming Peter's role among the disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, who had previously denied Jesus three times.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_tiberias.htm">Sea of Tiberias</a></b><br>The location where Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Present during this interaction, witnessing Jesus' reinstatement of Peter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_meal.htm">The Meal</a></b><br>A shared breakfast of fish and bread, symbolizing fellowship and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_forgiveness.htm">Restoration and Forgiveness</a></b><br>Jesus' question to Peter is an act of restoration, showing that failure is not final with Christ.

The meal confirms His bodily resurrection (cf. <a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41-43</a>) and sets a warm, familiar context for what follows.<p>&#8226; The timing&#8212;after physical nourishment&#8212;is deliberate. Jesus often teaches once immediate needs are met (<a href="/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34-41</a>). Here He moves from feeding bodies to feeding souls.<p>&#8226; The scene echoes earlier lakeside moments when Jesus called Peter (<a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1-11</a>). It signals a fresh start after Peter&#8217;s three denials (<a href="/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus asked Simon Peter, &#8220;Simon son of John, do you love Me more than these?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jesus addresses him as &#8220;Simon son of John,&#8221; the name used before Peter&#8217;s commissioning (<a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>). It underscores a return to basics: identity and allegiance.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Do you love Me more than these?&#8221; likely points to the other disciples and the fishing life surrounding them. Peter had once claimed superior devotion (<a href="/matthew/26-33.htm">Matthew 26:33</a>). Jesus gently exposes that boast and invites humble reaffirmation.<p>&#8226; Love (agap&#225;&#333;) is Christ-centered commitment, not emotion alone (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The question tests whether Peter&#8217;s loyalty now rests on repentance rather than self-confidence.<p>&#8226; Similar probing appears in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a> (&#8220;Where are you?&#8221;) and <a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a> (&#8220;What are you doing here, Elijah?&#8221;).

The change from bragging to trusting Jesus&#8217; knowledge marks genuine repentance.<p>&#8226; Three prior denials had been public; now Peter&#8217;s confession is public too, restoring his witness (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The repetition that follows (vv. 16-17) mirrors the three denials, showing full restoration (<a href="/mark/14-72.htm">Mark 14:72</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s response fits <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>&#8212;God knows every thought and motive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus replied, &#8220;Feed My lambs.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jesus turns confession into commission.

After meeting physical needs, Jesus probes Peter&#8217;s heart, prompting a humble confession that trusts Christ&#8217;s knowledge. In response, Jesus entrusts Peter with the care of His tender followers. Loving Jesus is inseparable from tending His people, and forgiven disciples become faithful shepherds in His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas.</span>--The better text here and in <a href="/context/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16-17</a>, is, <span class= "ital">Simon, son of John.</span> The contrast of the name by which the Evangelist denotes, and with that by which the Lord addresses Peter, at once strikes us as significant, and the more so because it comes in a context containing several significant verbal contrasts. Our Lord's words would seem to address him as one who had fallen from the steadfastness of the Rock-man, and had been true rather to his natural than to his apostolic name. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-42.htm" title="And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.">John 1:42</a>, and <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Lovest thou me more than these?</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> than these disciples who are present here with thee. It seems unnecessary to add this explanation, but not a few English notes on this verse explain the word "these" of the fishes, or of the boats and nets, as though the question was, "Lovest thou Me more than thy worldly calling? Art thou willing to give up all for Me?" The obvious reference is to Peter's own comparison of himself with others in the confidence of love which he thought could never fail. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/26-33.htm" title="Peter answered and said to him, Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended.">Matthew 26:33</a>; <a href="/mark/14-29.htm" title="But Peter said to him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.">Mark 14:29</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-19.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The revelations to be made in the services dictated by love and issuing in martyrdom. The confession made by Simon Peter, and the charge given to him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When therefore they had breakfasted, Jesus saith to Simon Peter.</span> His full name and Christ-given appellation is in the mind of the evangelist; but he, with marked emphasis, shows that our Lord went back to his relations with Simon before the latter's first introduction to him (see <a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>, etc.), and recalls the attitude Christ had taken to Simon on more than one memorable occasion (<a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>). On two of these occasions the simple humanity of the apostle was the basis on which the Lord proceeded to confer upon him the high official designation. The grace of God, in the first instance, selected Simon of Jonah to be a rock. In the second, "not flesh and blood," but the Father's grace, revealed the mystery of the Divine Sonship to him, and won the name of Peter. In the third, the utter weakness of Simon's own flesh reveals the power of the prayer of Jesus for him, so that he might ultimately convert his brethren; and now "Simon" is reinstated after his fall into his apostolic office. <span class="cmt_word">Simon, son of Jona</span> - or, John (see <a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>, note) - <span class="cmt_word">lovest thou me more than these?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> more than these other disciples love me? Thou hast seen more of my compassion, farther into my heart, deeper into my Person, my position, and my work, than they have done; thou hast dared again and again to ask for higher service and more conspicuous distinction. Thou hast made louder protestations than any of these of thine unworthiness to serve me, and in the deep consciousness of humiliation thou hast been more emphatic than any of them in refusing grace which thou thoughtest it might dishonor me to give. Thou didst indeed say, "Though all men should be offended at me or should deny me," thou wouldst never be offended and never deny me. "Dost thou love me more than they do?" There is no positive reference to the denial and fall of Peter; but the implication and suggestion cannot be hidden, though Hengstenberg and others fail to appreciate it. The circumstance that Peter was "grieved" because the Lord put this question to him a third time makes the reference very little less than explicit. The real significance of the narrative is the reinstitution of Peter in the position of importance he had filled throughout, and an indication of the nature and quality of that service. In Simon's reply, <span class="cmt_word">Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee</span>, three things are very noticeable. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Peter says nothing of the superiority of his affection for his Lord over that of his colleagues. Had they not in outward act been more faithful than he? He could not arrogate any sweeter, dearer, more abounding affection than he was willing to believe that they felt for their Master. It is scarcely worth while to notice the miserable translation that some few commentators have suggested: "Lovest thou me more than (thou lovest) these fishing-smacks and this thriving business on the lake?" Observe <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Peter's admission that the Lord knew his inmost heart, concedes, therefore, that the question was merely intended to test his faithfulness, and force him to a more salutary and binding acknowledgment.
