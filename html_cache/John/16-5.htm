He is preparing His disciples for His departure, which refers to His ascension to the Father. The phrase "Him who sent Me" emphasizes Jesus' divine mission and origin, affirming His relationship with God the Father. This is consistent with earlier statements in the Gospel of John, where Jesus frequently speaks of being sent by the Father (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17, 5</a>:23-24). The ascension is a pivotal event in Christian theology, marking the completion of Jesus' earthly ministry and the beginning of His heavenly intercession (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>yet none of you asks Me, &#8216;Where are You going?&#8217;</b><br>This highlights the disciples' lack of understanding and their focus on their immediate concerns rather than the larger divine plan. Earlier, Peter had asked a similar question in <a href="/john/13-36.htm">John 13:36</a>, but here, Jesus points out that they are not truly grasping the significance of His departure. The disciples are troubled by the thought of losing Jesus' physical presence, which reflects their human perspective and emotional response. This moment underscores the need for the coming of the Holy Spirit, who will guide them into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>) and help them understand the spiritual implications of Jesus' return to the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples about His impending departure to the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, they are struggling to understand the significance of His departure.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Referred to as "Him who sent Me," indicating the divine mission and origin of Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting for this discourse, where Jesus shares His final teachings with His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ascension.htm">The Ascension</a></b><br>The event Jesus is alluding to, where He will return to the Father after His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' departure is part of His divine mission.

Up to this moment He has prepared the disciples for what is coming&#8212;betrayal, crucifixion, resurrection, and departure. &#8220;Now&#8221; marks the nearness of those events. Earlier He had spoken of His absence in general terms (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-4</a>), but here the moment is immediate.<p>&#8226; The contrast (&#8220;however&#8221;) reminds us that divine plans move forward even when human feelings lag behind (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/16-6.htm">John 16:6</a> notes their hearts were &#8220;filled with grief,&#8221; showing why this new statement matters: sorrow must yield to trust in God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am going to Him who sent Me</b><p>Jesus restates His mission&#8217;s bookends&#8212;sent by the Father, returning to the Father (<a href="/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a>; 17:11).<p>&#8226; His going is not defeat but completion (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The Father&#8217;s sending underscores divine authority; the return underscores acceptance of the finished work (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Because He goes to the Father, the Helper will come (<a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>), proving this departure benefits believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet none of you asks Me</b><p>Moments earlier Peter had asked, &#8220;Lord, where are You going?&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-36.htm">John 13:36</a>), and Thomas said, &#8220;We do not know where You are going&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-5.htm">John 14:5</a>). Those were surface-level concerns focused on separation, not on God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p>&#8226; Jesus exposes that their present silence flows from self-absorbed sorrow (<a href="/john/16-6.htm">John 16:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine faith looks beyond immediate loss to God&#8217;s larger purpose (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Where are You going?&#8217;</b><p>The question Jesus wants is not a mere geographic inquiry but a spiritual pursuit: &#8220;Show us the glory of Your return so we can rejoice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Had they truly asked, He would have unfolded the joy of His exaltation (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Knowing His destination would strengthen them to endure the coming trial (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p>&#8226; We learn to center our attention on Christ&#8217;s position at the Father&#8217;s right hand (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-2</a>) rather than on the pain of His temporary absence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/16-5.htm">John 16:5</a> highlights a gracious correction. Jesus is on the verge of completing His mission and returning to the Father, yet the disciples&#8217; sorrow blinds them to the triumph embedded in His words. By pointing out that they have not truly asked, &#8220;Where are You going?&#8221; He invites them&#8212;and us&#8212;to lift our eyes from loss to glory, from immediate feelings to eternal realities. His departure is victory, securing the Spirit&#8217;s arrival and guaranteeing our hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">But now I go my way to him that sent me.</span>--(Comp. <a href="/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a>; <a href="/john/14-12.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father.">John 14:12</a>.) The work of His apostleship on earth was drawing to its close, and He was about to return to the Father from whom He had received it. This was to Him matter of joy, and if they had really loved Him would have been so to them. They would have thought of the future before Him, as He was then thinking, in the fulness of His love, of the future before them.<p><span class= "bld">And none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</span>--Peter had asked this very question (<a href="/john/13-36.htm" title="Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where go you?

Peter's question had obviously turned the whole matter back upon himself, and the way in which the Lord's departure affected his own duties and position; and the same may be said of Thomas. They had both lost sight of the "whither" in the pain and anguish of the departure. Our Lord had great difficulty in inducing them to realize the blessedness that would befall themselves from his own exaltation, and even now, after all that he had said about this great power and glory which awaited him, he added, <span class="cmt_word">Because I have spoken these things to you</span> - since all along you are taking the dark side, and looking on the anguish of my departure and desolateness of your own condition, instead of the grandeur of the new kingdom and dispensation of which you will be witnesses and organs - <span class="cmt_word">sorrow hath filled your heart</span>; the one heart which I throughout have been seeking to comfort.
