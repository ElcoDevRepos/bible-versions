The disciples' testimony is crucial as it fulfills Jesus' earlier promise that He would rise again (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-22</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of eyewitness testimony in the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where the disciples are called to be witnesses to the ends of the earth. The resurrection is central to Christian faith, as Paul emphasizes in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-17</a>, where he states that if Christ has not been raised, then the faith is futile.<p><b>But he replied, &#8220;Unless I see the nail marks in His hands,</b><br>Thomas's response reflects a common human desire for tangible evidence. The mention of "nail marks" is significant, as it confirms the method of crucifixion, a Roman execution practice. This detail aligns with <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, which prophetically describes the Messiah's hands and feet being pierced. Thomas's skepticism is not unique; it mirrors the doubts of others who initially struggled to believe in the resurrection (<a href="/luke/24-11.htm">Luke 24:11</a>).<p><b>and put my finger where the nails have been,</b><br>Thomas's demand to physically touch Jesus' wounds indicates a deep need for personal verification. This request highlights the physical reality of Jesus' resurrection body, countering any notion that the resurrection was merely spiritual or metaphorical. The emphasis on touch recalls 1 <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, where the apostle speaks of having heard, seen, and touched the Word of life, affirming the tangible reality of Jesus.<p><b>and put my hand into His side,</b><br>The reference to Jesus' side points back to <a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>, where a soldier pierced Jesus' side, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a> about looking on the one they have pierced. This act of touching the side would serve as undeniable proof of Jesus' identity and the reality of His resurrection. It also symbolizes the intimate and personal nature of faith, where belief often requires a personal encounter with Christ.<p><b>I will never believe.&#8221;</b><br>Thomas's declaration of disbelief unless he sees and touches Jesus' wounds highlights the struggle between faith and doubt. This moment sets the stage for Jesus' later appearance to Thomas, where He invites Thomas to touch His wounds, leading to Thomas's profound confession of faith in <a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>. This interaction illustrates the grace and patience of Jesus in addressing doubt and the transformative power of encountering the risen Christ. Thomas's journey from doubt to belief serves as an encouragement for those who struggle with faith, reminding believers of Jesus' words in <a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>, "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/thomas.htm">Thomas (also called Didymus)</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles, known for his skepticism and desire for tangible proof of Jesus' resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_other_disciples.htm">The Other Disciples</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' followers who had already witnessed the resurrected Christ and were sharing this news with Thomas.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The likely location where the disciples were gathered when they encountered the risen Jesus, a place of fellowship and revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection_of_jesus.htm">The Resurrection of Jesus</a></b><br>The central event of Christian faith, where Jesus rose from the dead, confirming His divinity and the truth of His teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nail_marks_and_jesus'_side.htm">The Nail Marks and Jesus' Side</a></b><br>Physical evidence of Jesus' crucifixion, which Thomas demanded to see to believe in the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_faith.htm">The Nature of Faith</a></b><br>Faith often requires belief without physical evidence.

While Christ graciously meets Thomas&#8217;s conditions in the next verses, the passage calls readers to trust the reliable witness of Scripture and the apostles, joining the blessed company who believe without seeing yet are certain that &#8220;Jesus is Lord.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails.</span>--This demand for the evidence of his own senses, and refusal to admit the testimony of eyewitnesses, though these were the whole of his ten brethren in the Apostolic band, remind us of the demand made to Christ Himself, "We know not whither Thou goest, and how can we know the way?"<p>The reading of the second clause varies between "print of the nails" and "place of the nails." The Greek words vary by only one letter (<span class= "greekheb">?????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> "print"; <span class= "greekheb">?????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> "place"), so that copyists may easily have taken one for the other. If we read "place," it answers to the touch of the finger, as "print" does to the sight of the eye; but, on the other hand, there is in the repetition an expression of determination, almost, we may say, amounting to obstinacy, which corresponds with the position which Thomas is taking.<p><span class= "bld">And thrust my hand into his side.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/20-20.htm" title="And when he had so said, he showed to them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.">John 20:20</a>. The feet are not mentioned, but the hands and the side would be demonstrative evidence. We cannot properly infer from this verse that the feet were not nailed.<p><span class= "bld">I will not believe.</span>--The determination is expressed in its strongest form by the double Greek negative, "I will by no means believe."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord</span>. Mary, Cleopas, Peter, John, bad all tried to animate his drooping spirit. <span class="cmt_word">But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands</span> (as I presume you have) <span class="cmt_word">the print of the nails, and</span> (yet more than you have done - touch as well as see) p<span class="cmt_word">ut my finger into the print</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will by no means believe</span> - not merely in the Resurrection, which you attest, but in the grand reality I was fain to admit so recently, the supposed fact that he came from the Father, that he is the Way to the Father, that he is in the Father, that he is all he said he was. If Themas could grasp the new life, the new and hitherto unrevealed order of being, if he could spiritually see the realization of all the mystery of love in the Resurrection, then all that he was doubting would flash forth at once from its hiding-place. Perhaps, if he had been present with the rest, he would have accepted it; but how can he "believe through their word"? The extent of his doubt is further seen in this: he did not say, "If I see the print of the nails... I will believe;" but, "Except I see... I will by no means believe." The first manifestation of our Lord seemed to correspond with the first portion of the Savior's high-priestly prayer, viz. that he might himself be glorified; the second manifestation of the day corresponded with the prayer for the disciples; and now the third manifestation is to meet the difficulties of the third and more numerous class, who must gather all their conviction from the evidence of others. This subtle relation between parts of the Gospel shows how profound is the principle of its construction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
