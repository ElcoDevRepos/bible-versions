The law emphasized justice and fairness, requiring evidence and testimony before a conviction. This reflects the principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16-17</a>, where judges are instructed to hear cases fairly. The question posed here highlights the importance of due process, a concept that is foundational in both ancient and modern legal systems.<p><b>without first hearing from him</b><br>The requirement to hear from the accused is rooted in the legal traditions of ancient Israel, where a fair trial was essential. This principle is echoed in <a href="/exodus/23.htm">Exodus 23:1-3</a>, which warns against spreading false reports and emphasizes impartiality. The practice of hearing from the accused ensures that justice is not only done but seen to be done, preventing wrongful convictions.<p><b>to determine what he has done?</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the need for a thorough investigation to establish the facts of a case. It aligns with the biblical mandate for truth and justice, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>, which warns against answering a matter before hearing it.
