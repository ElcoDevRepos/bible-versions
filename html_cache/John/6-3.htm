Mountains in Scripture are places of revelation and teaching, such as Mount Sinai where Moses received the Law (Exodus 19) and the Mount of Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>). The mountain setting here may symbolize a place of teaching and revelation, preparing for the miraculous feeding of the 5,000. Geographically, this event occurs near the Sea of Galilee, a region known for its hills and mountains, providing a natural amphitheater for Jesus' teachings.<p><b>and sat down</b><br>In Jewish culture, sitting was the traditional posture for a teacher or rabbi when instructing disciples. This act signifies Jesus assuming the role of a teacher, ready to impart wisdom and guidance. It reflects a position of authority and readiness to engage with His followers. This posture is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus sits to teach, such as in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>).<p><b>with His disciples</b><br>The presence of the disciples highlights the intimate relationship between Jesus and His followers. They are often depicted as learners and witnesses to His ministry, tasked with understanding and later spreading His teachings. This setting provides a context for Jesus to prepare His disciples for the upcoming miracle and to deepen their understanding of His mission. The disciples' presence also emphasizes the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry, where teaching and miracles are shared experiences that strengthen their faith and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>A place of retreat and teaching, often associated with significant biblical events and revelations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being taught and prepared for their future ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_the_mountain.htm">The Significance of the Mountain</a></b><br>Mountains in Scripture often symbolize a place of divine encounter and revelation.
