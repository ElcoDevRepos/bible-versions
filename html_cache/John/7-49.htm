In the context of <a href="/john/7.htm">John 7</a>, the crowd consists of Jewish people gathered in Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles. This festival was one of the three major Jewish feasts, drawing large numbers of people to the city. The crowd's diverse composition included those who were curious about Jesus, those who believed in Him, and those who were skeptical or hostile.<p><b>that does not know the law</b><br>The "law" here refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament, which were central to Jewish religious life. The Pharisees, who are speaking in this verse, prided themselves on their knowledge and interpretation of the law. They viewed themselves as the guardians of religious orthodoxy. The statement implies a disdain for the common people, whom the Pharisees considered ignorant of the law's intricacies. This reflects a broader cultural divide between the religious elite and the laypeople, who often lacked formal education in the Scriptures.<p><b>they are under a curse</b><br>The idea of being "under a curse" is rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27-28</a>, where blessings and curses are pronounced based on obedience or disobedience to God's law. The Pharisees' statement suggests that ignorance of the law equates to being cursed, as they believed that proper knowledge and observance of the law were necessary for God's favor. This reflects a legalistic perspective, contrasting with Jesus' teaching that emphasized the spirit of the law and the importance of faith and grace. The Pharisees' view also highlights their misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, which was to fulfill the law and offer salvation to all, regardless of their social or educational status.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law of Moses and oral traditions.

The Pharisees were accustomed to show sovereign contempt for those who had no admission to their own culture and methods of knowledge. Edersheim and Wunsche quote 'Pes.,' 49, <span class="accented">b</span>; 'Baba,' B. 8, <span class="accented">b</span>; and 'Chetub.,' 3:6 in proof of the utter inhumanity of their judgments. This language did not endorse a formal excommunication of the multitude - a supposition in its own nature impossible and absurd - but it expressed the brusque and harsh contempt with which the Pharisees then present wished to correct the weak compliance of their own servants. Lange presses the utterance too far. We cannot see in it more than the bitter outburst of their pent-up spite. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
