In the context of the Gospel of John, "light" symbolizes truth, purity, and divine revelation. The concept of light is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where God is often associated with light (e.g., <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>). Jesus as the "true Light" contrasts with false teachings and deceptive philosophies, affirming His divine nature and mission.<p><b>who gives light to everyone</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the universal scope of Christ's revelation. The light of Christ is not limited to a specific group but is available to all humanity. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's desire for all people to come to the knowledge of truth (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). It also reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Servant of the Lord is a light to the nations. The phrase underscores the inclusivity of the Gospel message.<p><b>was coming into the world</b><br>This indicates the incarnation of Jesus Christ, the moment when the Word became flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The phrase "coming into the world" signifies the historical event of Jesus' birth and His entrance into human history. It highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's arrival (e.g., <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). The world, in this context, often represents humanity in its fallen state, in need of redemption and enlightenment. Jesus' coming into the world marks the pivotal point in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_true_light.htm">The True Light</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of divine truth and revelation.

Earlier he said, &#8220;In Him was life, and that life was the light of men&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>), so the &#8220;true&#8221; Light is contrasted with every lesser, temporary, or misleading light.<p>- Jesus later declares, &#8220;I am the Light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). This shows that His light is not merely intellectual insight but saving, guiding life.<p>- Scripture consistently ties light to God&#8217;s character: &#8220;God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>). Therefore, calling Jesus the &#8220;true Light&#8221; affirms His full deity and moral purity.<p>- Practical takeaway: every counterfeit promise of enlightenment must be evaluated against Christ Himself, the absolute standard (<a href="/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who gives light to everyone</b><p>- The verse insists on the universal scope of Christ&#8217;s illumination.

The light shines; human response determines whether it becomes salvation or judgment (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>).<p>- This universality fuels missions: believers carry His light &#8220;so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was coming into the world</b><p>- The verb points to a historical event: the incarnation. &#8220;The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>- Christ &#8220;emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>) and entered the very world He created (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>).<p>- His coming fulfilled prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; 60:1-3) and arrived &#8220;when the fullness of time had come&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>).<p>- Purpose of His arrival:<p>&#8226; To reveal the Father (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>).<p>&#8226; To destroy the works of the devil (<a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; To provide atonement by tasting death for everyone (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14-17</a>).<p>- Incarnation assures us that God is not distant; He stepped into our darkness to rescue us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a> packs profound truth into a single sentence: Jesus, the only authentic Light, radiates God&#8217;s life and truth to all humanity and did so by personally entering our world. Because He illuminates every heart and offers salvation to every soul, the proper response is to receive and follow Him, walking in His light and reflecting it to others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">That was the true Light.</span>--The right rendering of this verse is uncertain. It would, probably, give a better sense to translate it, <span class= "ital">The true Light which lighteth every man was coming into the world, i.e.,</span> was manifesting itself at the time when John was bearing witness and men were mistaking the lamp for the light. (Comp. <a href="/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>, Note.)<p><span class= "bld">The true Light</span> was not "true" as opposed to "false," but "true" as answering to the perfect ideal, and as opposed to all more or less imperfect representations. The meaning of the Greek is quite clear. The difficulty arises from the fact that in English there is but one word to represent the two ideas. The word for the fuller meaning of "ideally true" is not confined to St. John, but is naturally of very frequent recurrence in his writings. The adjective is used nine times in this Gospel, and not at all in the other three. A comparison of the passages will show how important it is to get a right conception of what the word means, and will help to give it. (See <a href="/john/4-23.htm" title="But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.">John 4:23</a>; <a href="/john/4-37.htm" title="And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.">John 4:37</a>; <a href="/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>; <a href="/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>; <a href="/john/8-16.htm" title="And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.">John 8:16</a>; <a href="/john/15-1.htm" title="I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.">John 15:1</a>; <a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>; <a href="/john/19-35.htm" title="And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he said true, that you might believe.">John 19:35</a>.) But, as ideally true, the Light was not subject to the changing conditions of time and space, but was and is true for all humanity, and "lighteth every man." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="accented">The illumination of the archetypal Light before incarnation.</span> There are at least three grammatical translations of this verse. Either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with Meyer, we may give to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span> the complete sense of existence, presence, and include in it the full predicate of the sentence; thus: "Existing, present (when John commenced his ministry), was the veritable Light which enlighteneth every man coming into the world." But the clause, "coming into the world," would here not only be superfluous, but moreover, while used elsewhere and often of Christ's incarnation, is never used of ordinary birth in the Scriptures, though it is a rabbinical expression. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Lange, Moulton, Westcott, Godet, applying the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to the <span class="accented">light</span> rather than to <span class="accented">man</span>, translate it, "That was the true Light which lighteth every man, by coming into the world, or that cometh into the world." The difficulty of this is that it makes the coming into the world, in some new sense, the occasion of the illumination of every man, although the evangelist has already spoken (ver. 4) of the Life which is the Light of men. A third method is to make the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> the true predicate of the sentence, and translate thus: <span class="cmt_word">The veritable Light which illumines every man was coming</span> (ever coming) <span class="cmt_word">into the world;</span> and there is a sense and manner of his coming which transcends all others, about which he is to speak at length. This might receive another meaning if <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> were equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>; then a positive reference would here he made to the historic fact of the Incarnation. But it seems to me the evangelist is drawing a contrast between the continuous coming into the world of the veritable Light and the specific Incarnation of ver. 14. Consequently, the author here travels over and connotes a wider theme, namely, the operation of that archetypal Light, that veritable Light which differs from all mere reflections of it, or imitations of it, or luminous testimonies to it. The difference between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is important. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a> and John 5:31, and very often to denote the true in opposition to the false, the veracious as distinct from the deceptive. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is used in the Gospel (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23, 37</a>; <a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32</a>; <a href="/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>; <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>; <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>), First Epistle (<a href="/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>), and Apocalypse (<a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>), and hardly anywhere else (see Introduction), for the real as opposed to the phenomenal, the archetypal as opposed to the various embodiments of it, the veritable as distinct from that which does not answer to its own ideal.
