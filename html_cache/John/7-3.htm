At this point in the Gospel narrative, they did not believe in Him as the Messiah (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>). This skepticism highlights the fulfillment of prophecy that a prophet is without honor in his own home (<a href="/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a>). Their relationship with Jesus provides insight into the familial dynamics and the challenges Jesus faced even among His closest kin.<p><b>&#8220;Leave here and go to Judea</b><br>The brothers' suggestion for Jesus to go to Judea is significant because Judea, particularly Jerusalem, was the religious and cultural center of Jewish life. It was the location of the Temple and the site of major Jewish festivals. This request may have been made with a mix of skepticism and a desire for Jesus to prove Himself in a more public and influential setting. The journey from Galilee to Judea was a common pilgrimage route, especially during festivals, and it was a journey that Jesus often made during His ministry.<p><b>so that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing.</b><br>The brothers' mention of "disciples" indicates that Jesus had followers beyond the Twelve Apostles, including those in Judea. The emphasis on "works" refers to the miracles and signs Jesus performed, which were central to His ministry and served as evidence of His divine authority (<a href="/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25</a>). This statement reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, as His works were not merely for public spectacle but to reveal the Kingdom of God and fulfill His Father's will.

Their counsel is flavored by skepticism, not by faith.<p>&#8211; Scripture often shows that genuine faith is not inherited but personally embraced (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>; <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>). Jesus&#8217; own kin illustrate that truth&#8212;physical proximity to Christ does not guarantee spiritual insight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Leave here and go to Judea</b><p>&#8211; They are urging Him to move from Galilee to Judea, the region of Jerusalem and the Temple, the center stage of religious life (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p>&#8211; The suggestion sounds helpful, but it actually reveals a worldly mindset: seeking a larger platform and public acclaim. The brothers think influence comes from visibility; Jesus knows true authority comes from the Father&#8217;s timing (<a href="/john/7-6.htm">John 7:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Scripture repeatedly contrasts human strategies with God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). Here, earthly family advice collides with divine purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing</b><p>&#8211; Their focus is on the crowd&#8217;s reaction&#8212;&#8220;show the works, gather followers, make a name.&#8221; Yet Jesus consistently resists performing signs merely for spectacle (<a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a>; 6:26).<p>&#8211; Authentic discipleship is built on truth, not on sensationalism (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23-25</a>). Jesus will indeed perform miracles in Judea, but only as the Father directs (<a href="/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25, 32</a>); His ultimate &#8220;work&#8221; will be the cross and resurrection (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32-33</a>).<p>&#8211; The brothers expose a common temptation: to measure ministry by numbers and notoriety. Scripture redirects us to obedience and faithfulness (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-9.htm">2 Corinthians 5:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3</a> captures a moment when Jesus&#8217; unbelieving brothers press Him to adopt worldly methods&#8212;greater visibility, larger crowds, public proof&#8212;assuming that success hinges on human approval. Their advice, though seemingly practical, clashes with the Father&#8217;s timetable and the deeper purpose of Christ&#8217;s mission. The verse reminds us that even well-intentioned counsel must be weighed against God&#8217;s will, that true faith sees beyond outward signs, and that genuine ministry flows from obedience rather than publicity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">His brethren . . .</span>--Comp.

The prophet hath not honour in His own home, and His brethren, who have seen these works and do not believe, challenge Him to an open demonstration of them. There is another great feast at hand, and His disciples from all parts will be at Jerusalem, where the rulers will test His claims. If He is the Messiah, no conspiracy to kill Him can prevail; and if these works are really divine, let the great body of disciples see them, and amid the joyous feast, and in the royal city, proclaim Him king. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His brethren therefore</span> (pointing to the high significance of this national and triumphant feast) <span class="cmt_word">said unto him.</span> These brethren were (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>) James, Joses, Simon, and Judas, and, without entering once more on the much-debated question of their actual relation to Jesus (see <a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>, and notes), it may be said that this passage in a very marked manner discriminates them from the apostles or disciples, and practically negatives the "cousin" theory derived from the supposed identification of Alphaeus with Cleophas, and consequently of the sons of Alphaeus (James, Judas, and Simon) with the apostles of the same names. The lack of sympathy shown by these men, and the positive assertion of their non-belief in Jesus, is incompatible with the great confession so recently made (ch. 6:68, 69), and cannot (with Hengstenberg and Lange) be diluted into imperfect appreciation of claims which they wished in a secular sense to press forward to full assertion. They appeared here to criticize their Brother's prolonged absence from Jerusalem, and his abstention from the Passover and other national festivals. They would, perhaps sincerely, hurry forward his public demonstration, and compel him to say to the great world what he had been saying in Galilaean villages, in the borders of Tyre, and in the cities of Decapolis. <span class="cmt_word">Depart hence, and go into Judaea</span>. "This is the time and place." Thoma sees in this advice the same idea which, on the mount of Transfiguration, was suggested by Moses and Elijah "concerning the departure which the Lord was to accomplish in Jerusalem." The Johannist has clothed the same material insinuation in a dialogue (<span class="accented">dialogische Verhandlung</span>). It has been said that this kind of advice is rather in favour of the hypothesis that these brethren were elder than Jesus, and possibly the children of Joseph by an earlier marriage, who thus took upon themselves the function of advisers. Such a hint, however (given by Westcott), seems very shadowy confirmation of the theory. Younger brothers would be just as likely to err in the same direction. <span class="cmt_word">In order that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.</span> The words "thy disciples" may (Godet, Luthardt formerly) have had special reference to the fact that our Lord had made in Judaea "more disciples than had John" (<a href="/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>), that there were even members of the Sanhedrin who had to some extent looked favourably upon him (<a href="/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>), and needed confirmation of their faith. There may also have been tacit reference to the circumstance recorded in ch. 6. that his <span class="accented">Galilaean</span> disciples had deserted him; but it is more likely (Meyer) that the brethren took it for granted that those who in numerous places had received his word would be gathered together in Jerusalem, and would have an opportunity of seeing with their own eyes and in consociation with each other the works of healing and might which were being variously reported, canvassed, and disputed in the schools of Galilee. "Thy disciples" is a wide word, and may easily refer to all who, whether in Jerusalem or Galilee, went by his name. It is a designation which, however, does not include the speakers. "The works which thou art doing" is sufficiently illustrated from the group of remarkable events which had eternalized the previous twelve months of the Galilaean ministry (see on ver. 1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
