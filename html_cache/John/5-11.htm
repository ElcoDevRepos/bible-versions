It highlights the importance of personal testimony in the Gospels. The healed man is responding to the Jewish leaders who questioned him about carrying his mat on the Sabbath, which was considered work and thus a violation of their interpretation of the Sabbath law. This sets the stage for a conflict between Jesus' actions and the religious leaders' understanding of the law.<p><b>The man who made me well</b><br>This refers to Jesus, who had just performed a miraculous healing at the Pool of Bethesda. The phrase emphasizes the transformative power of Jesus' miracles, which serve as signs pointing to His divine authority. The healing itself is significant, as it demonstrates Jesus' compassion and power over physical ailments, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the Messiah bringing healing.<p><b>told me</b><br>This indicates the authority of Jesus' command. In the cultural context, a rabbi or teacher's words carried significant weight, and the healed man is acknowledging Jesus' authority by following His instructions. This also reflects the theme of obedience to Christ's words, which is a recurring theme in the New Testament.<p><b>&#8216;Pick up your mat and walk.&#8217;</b><br>This command from Jesus not only resulted in physical healing but also symbolized spiritual renewal and liberation. The act of carrying the mat on the Sabbath was controversial, as it challenged the Pharisaic interpretation of the law. This phrase connects to other instances where Jesus reinterprets the law, emphasizing mercy and the spirit of the law over legalistic adherence (e.g., <a href="/matthew/12.htm">Matthew 12:1-8</a>). The command to walk signifies a new beginning and a call to live in the freedom that Jesus offers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of John, who performs the healing at the pool of Bethesda.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healed_man.htm">The Healed Man</a></b><br>A man who had been an invalid for 38 years and was healed by Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Religious authorities who questioned the healed man about carrying his mat on the Sabbath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pool_of_bethesda.htm">Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>A pool in Jerusalem where the healing took place, known for its supposed healing properties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>The day of rest in Jewish law, which becomes a point of contention in this account.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_christ's_command.htm">Obedience to Christ's Command</a></b><br>The healed man's immediate response to Jesus' command demonstrates the importance of obedience in faith.

The Prophet-like Healer must know what was right, and upon his shoulders the responsibility must rest. There was a rabbinic saying, which the cured man may or may not have heard, that conferred a dispensing power upon a prophet; but the marl could not have known with any certainty that such was Christ's official character. It is, moreover, clear that he did not know at this moment either the face, the voice, or the name. Meyer hears a ring of defiance in these words. The other hints we obtain touching the man's character do not sustain such an idea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;The [man who]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
