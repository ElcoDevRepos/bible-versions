This aligns with the doctrine of the Trinity, where the Word is understood as the second person, the Son, who is distinct yet fully divine. The concept of the Word being "with" God suggests a relationship of intimacy and unity, reflecting the eternal fellowship within the Godhead. This is consistent with other scriptural references such as <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>, where Jesus speaks of the glory He shared with the Father before the world began.<p><b>in the beginning.</b><br>The phrase "in the beginning" echoes the opening of <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, drawing a parallel between the creation account and the role of the Word in creation. It signifies the timeless nature of the Word, existing before time and creation. This connection underscores the Word's active participation in creation, as seen in <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, where all things were made through Him. The use of "beginning" also points to the foundational role of the Word in the divine plan, highlighting the continuity of God's purpose from creation to redemption. This phrase sets the stage for understanding the Word's authority and sovereignty over all creation, as further elaborated in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word.htm">The Word (Logos)</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the pre-existent divine Word who was with God from the beginning.

Scripture invites us to embrace both truths simultaneously.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the beginning</b><p>John lifts our eyes to the very first moment of time&#8212;and beyond.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a> starts the Bible the same way: &#8220;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&#8221; John&#8217;s wording deliberately ties Jesus to that opening sentence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a> declares, &#8220;He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together,&#8221; underscoring pre-existence and sustaining power.<p>&#8226; <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> prophesies a Ruler &#8220;whose origins are from of old, from the days of eternity,&#8221; showing that Messiah&#8217;s timeline stretches into eternity past.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a> records Jesus saying, &#8220;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&#8221; placing Him at both ends of history.<p>John therefore insists that when time itself began, Jesus already was.

Accepting the verse at face value affirms Christ&#8217;s deity, His distinct personhood within the Godhead, and His timeless, uncreated nature&#8212;truths echoed and reinforced throughout the rest of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The same was.</span>--This is a summary in one clause of the three assertions made in the first verse.<p><span class= "bld">The same,</span> that is, the Word who was God, existed before any act of creation, and in that existence was a person distinct from God. Yet it is more than a re-statement. We have arrived at the thought that the Word was one in nature with God. From this higher point of view, the steps below us are more clearly seen. The Word was God; the eternal pre-existence and personality are included in the thought.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same</span> Logos whom the writer has just affirmed to have been God himself, <span class="cmt_word">was</span>, though it might seem at first reading to be incompatible with the first or third clause of the first verse, nevertheless in the <span class="cmt_word">beginning with God</span> - "in the beginning," and therefore, as we have seen, eternally in relation with God. The previous statements are thus stringently enforced, and, notwithstanding their tendency to diverge, are once more bound into a new, unified, and emphatic utterance. Thus the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of the following sentences is charged with the sublime fulness of meaning which is involved in the three utterances of ver. 1. The first clause <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> declared that the Logos preceded the origination of all things, was the eternal ground of the world; the second <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> asserted his unique personality, so that he stands over against the eternal God, in mutual communion with the Absolute and Eternal One; the third clause <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> maintains further that the Logos was not a second God, nor merely Divine (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) or God-like, nor is he described as proceeding out of or from God (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), nor is he to be called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "the God absolute," as opposed to all his manifestations; but the Logos is said to be <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">God"</span> - <span class="accented">God</span> in his nature and being. This second verse reasserts the eternal <span class="accented">relation</span> of such a personality "with God," and prepares the way for the statements of the following verses. The unity of the Logos and Theos might easily be supposed to reduce the distinction between them to subjective relations. The second verse emphasizes the objective validity of the relation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
