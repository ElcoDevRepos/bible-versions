In the context of ancient Palestine, the agricultural cycle was well understood, with specific times for planting and harvesting. This saying suggests a natural expectation of waiting for the harvest, which Jesus uses to illustrate a spiritual truth. The four-month period may not refer to a specific time of year but rather to the general understanding of the time needed for crops to mature. This sets the stage for Jesus to challenge the disciples' perception of readiness and timing in spiritual matters.<p><b>I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields,</b><br>Here, Jesus shifts from the physical to the spiritual, urging His disciples to change their perspective. "Lift up your eyes" is a call to awareness and vision beyond the immediate and physical. The fields represent the world and the people ready to receive the Gospel. This phrase emphasizes the urgency and readiness of the spiritual harvest, contrasting with the natural waiting period. It also suggests a divine perspective, encouraging believers to see the world as God sees it, full of potential for spiritual growth and conversion.<p><b>for they are ripe for harvest.</b><br>The ripeness of the fields symbolizes the readiness of people to receive the message of Christ. This statement indicates that the time for spiritual harvest is now, not in the distant future. It reflects the immediate opportunity for evangelism and the receptiveness of the Samaritan people, as seen in the surrounding context of <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, where many Samaritans come to believe in Jesus. This ripeness can also be seen as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the gathering of nations to God, such as in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. The urgency of the harvest underscores the need for laborers, as Jesus later emphasizes in <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>, calling for workers to gather the spiritual harvest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples, using the metaphor of the harvest to teach them about the urgency and readiness of spiritual work.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Jesus' followers who are being taught to recognize the immediacy of the spiritual harvest around them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritan_woman.htm">The Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, she is a key figure in the preceding context, whose encounter with Jesus leads to the spiritual awakening of her community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The region where this event takes place, significant for its mixed population and historical tensions with the Jews, highlighting the inclusivity of Jesus' message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_harvest.htm">The Harvest</a></b><br>A metaphor for the readiness of people to receive the Gospel, emphasizing the spiritual opportunity present at that moment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_the_gospel.htm">Urgency of the Gospel</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the immediacy of the spiritual harvest, urging believers to recognize and act upon the opportunities to share the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_awareness.htm">Spiritual Awareness</a></b><br>"Lift up your eyes" calls for spiritual discernment to see beyond the physical and recognize the spiritual needs around us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_the_gospel.htm">Inclusivity of the Gospel</a></b><br>The setting in Samaria underscores the universal reach of the Gospel, breaking cultural and ethnic barriers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_participation.htm">Active Participation</a></b><br>Believers are called to be active laborers in God's field, participating in the work of evangelism and discipleship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_timing.htm">Faith in God's Timing</a></b><br>Trust in God's perfect timing for the harvest, understanding that He prepares hearts to receive His message.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_4_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 4:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_urge_Gospel_sharing_per_John_4_35.htm">How does John 4:35 encourage urgency in sharing the Gospel today?

It follows immediately out of the contrast between the natural and spiritual food. Every outer fact is the sign of an inner truth. They here, as the woman in <a href="/john/4-11.htm" title="The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then have you that living water?">John 4:11</a>, as the teacher of Israel (<a href="/john/3-4.htm" title="Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?">John 3:4</a>), as the Jews (<a href="/john/2-20.htm" title="Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?">John 2:20</a>), speak in the language of the outer facts only. He speaks of the spiritual realities. Looking on the fields of springing corn, they would say that in four months there would be harvest. He sees signs of life springing up from seed sown in receptive hearts; and eyes lifted up and directed to the wide fields of the world's nations would see that the fulness of time was come, and that the fields were even now white to harvest. The Samaritans coming to Him are as the firstfruits, the earnest of the abundant sheaves which shall follow.<p><span class= "bld">Four months.</span>--This gives us probably a note on time. There is no evidence that it was a proverbial saying, and the form of the sentence is against the supposition. The legal beginning of harvest was fixed (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:">Leviticus 23:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-9.htm" title="Seven weeks shall you number to you: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as you begin to put the sickle to the corn.">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>) for the 16th of Nisan (April). This would give us in that year, which was a Jewish leap-year, with a month added (Wieseler's <span class= "ital">Synopsis,</span> Eng. Trans., p. 187), some time about the middle of the month Tebeth (January) as the date of this conversation. (Comp. <a href="/john/5-1.htm" title="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 5:1</a>.) For the idea of the harvest, comp. <a href="/context/matthew/9-36.htm" title="But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.">Matthew 9:36-38</a>, and the parable of the Sower, <a href="/matthew/13-3.htm" title="And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;">Matthew 13:3</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say not ye</span> - has not your talk with one another been, as you have passed through the springing corn, <span class="cmt_word">There are yet four months, and</span> <span class="accented">then <span class="cmt_word"></span>cometh the harvest?</span> This cannot be a proverbial expression for the time which elapses between sowing and harvest, as some (Lucke and Tholuck) have supposed, because, firstly, there is no mention of sowing at all; and secondly, because <span class="accented">six</span> months was the customary period between seed time and ingathering; and also because the "say not ye?" would then be inappropriate. I cannot doubt that it was a chronological hint that the time at which Jesus spake was four months from either the barley or wheat harvest. These harvests generally occurred between the middle of March and the middle of April. The time must, therefore, have been either the middle of November or of December. Tristram (Westcott) says the (wheat?) harvest began about the middle of April and lasted till the end of May. This would bring the time forward another month. This makes our Lord to have spent some eight months since the Passover, either in Jerusalem or in the Judaean land, on his earliest mission, which as yet had brought no obvious results. Men had come to his baptism, but had not appreciated or accepted his claims. The faith already awakened had been of the evanescent character, based on "signs," outward not inward, a "milk faith," to which he did not entrust himself (ch, 2:240. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; they are whitening</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">harvest</span>. Our Lord now uses another metaphor - he bids the disciples glance across these rich cornfields, to observe the obvious effect already produced by the sowing of good seed in Samaritan soil. The people are flocking towards him. The harvest of souls is ripening, and it is great. You must wait four months before this springing corn will need the sickle. But I say unto you, The time is come. The kingdom is come. The reaper must prepare for instant service. Again, we have a note of personal identity between the Jesus of the Fourth Gospel and the Author of the parables of the sower and the harvest. The very rapidity with which he passes from the symbolism of <span class="accented">water</span> to the symbolism <span class="accented">of food</span>, and then to that of <span class="accented">seed time and harvest</span>, reminds us of One who "without a parable spake not." The words so far have universal application in every age. The harvest has always been ripening. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is used in this place only for the aspect of ripening corn. It has elsewhere the meaning of glittering, translucent whiteness, and perhaps it is used here for "dead ripe." The golden grain in late summer becomes white, and this intensifies the force of the image. It seems to say, "These fields will be sacrificed, these fruits will be wasted, these souls will be lost, unless they are reaped and brought into the heavenly garner." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
