This event demonstrated Jesus' divine power and authority, drawing large numbers of people who were eager to see more miracles or receive more physical sustenance. The absence of Jesus and His disciples indicates a moment of transition, as Jesus often withdrew to pray or to teach His disciples privately. This reflects the pattern in Jesus' ministry of balancing public teaching with private instruction and communion with the Father.<p><b>they got into the boats</b><br>The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Tiberias, was a central location in Jesus' ministry. The crowd's decision to get into boats shows their determination to follow Jesus, highlighting the impact of His miracles and teachings. Boats were a common mode of transportation across the lake, which was about 13 miles long and 8 miles wide. This detail underscores the geographical setting of Jesus' ministry, which often involved travel across this body of water.<p><b>and went to Capernaum</b><br>Capernaum served as a significant base for Jesus' ministry in Galilee. It was a bustling fishing village and a center of commerce, located on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee. Jesus performed many miracles here, including healing the centurion's servant and Peter's mother-in-law. The town's synagogue, where Jesus taught, has been partially excavated, providing archaeological evidence of its historical significance. Capernaum's role as a hub for Jesus' activities emphasizes its importance in the Gospel narratives.<p><b>to look for Him</b><br>The crowd's search for Jesus reflects their desire for more than just physical nourishment; they were seeking the spiritual truth and authority that Jesus embodied. This pursuit can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual journey of seeking Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The crowd's actions also foreshadow the deeper teachings Jesus would soon impart about the true nature of following Him, which involves seeking eternal life rather than temporary satisfaction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of people who had been following Jesus, witnessing His miracles, and were eager to see more of His works and hear His teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who had just performed the miracle of feeding the 5,000 and walked on water.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The close followers of Jesus who were learning from Him and assisting in His ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>A town on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, which served as a central hub for Jesus' ministry in Galilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boats.htm">The Boats</a></b><br>The means by which the crowd traveled across the Sea of Galilee to find Jesus, indicating their determination and desire to be near Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seek_jesus_with_determination.htm">Seek Jesus with Determination</a></b><br>The crowd's effort to find Jesus in Capernaum demonstrates the importance of earnestly seeking Christ in our own lives.

Now morning comes and they notice Jesus is missing.<p>&#8226; Awareness sparks responsibility; once someone has seen God&#8217;s power, neutrality is no longer an option (cf. <a href="/luke/11-29.htm">Luke 11:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The crowd&#8217;s physical eyesight mirrors spiritual perception&#8212;some will move toward faith while others cling to self-interest (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there</b><p>They expected both Teacher and followers to remain; instead, they find an empty shoreline.<p>&#8226; Absence becomes a God-given prompt: when familiar comforts disappear, the Lord often nudges people to seek Him more earnestly (<a href="/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The missing disciples remind us that genuine believers are meant to stay close to Jesus, not become attractions in themselves (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they got into the boats</b><p>Action replaces passive curiosity.

The verse invites us to move beyond curiosity or convenience, board whatever &#8220;boat&#8221; obedience requires, and seek the Lord until we find in Him&#8212;not merely His gifts&#8212;the true bread that satisfies forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">When the people.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the multitude,</span> as before.

They knew there was only one boat, and that the disciples had gone away in it, but Jesus had not. They expected therefore to find Him among themselves, but did not. Meanwhile, other boats had come across from Tiberias.
