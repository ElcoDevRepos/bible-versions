It suggests a sequence of events where John the Baptist is being questioned about his identity and mission.<p><b>the Pharisees</b><br>The Pharisees were a prominent religious group in Judaism during the time of Jesus. They were known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses and the oral traditions. They often held significant influence over the religious and social life of the Jewish people. In the Gospels, they frequently appear as opponents of Jesus, challenging His teachings and authority. Their presence here indicates the importance of John the Baptist's ministry and the potential threat they perceived it posed to their religious authority.<p><b>who had been sent</b><br>This phrase implies that the Pharisees were not acting on their own initiative but were dispatched by a higher authority, likely the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. This suggests an official inquiry into John the Baptist's activities, reflecting the concern of the religious leaders about his growing influence. The act of sending representatives also highlights the organized structure and authority of the Jewish religious system at the time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious and political group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

(For account of the Pharisees, see Note on <a href="/matthew/3-7.htm" title="But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?">Matthew 3:7</a>.) The statement is made to explain the question which follows, but it should be observed that in this Gospel, where the Sadducees are nowhere mentioned, the term "Pharisees" seems to be used almost in the sense of "Sanhedrin." (Comp. <a href="/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,">John 4:1</a>; <a href="/john/8-3.htm" title="And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the middle,">John 8:3</a>; <a href="/john/11-46.htm" title="But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.">John 11:46</a>; <a href="/john/11-57.htm" title="Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.">John 11:57</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they</span> <span class="cmt_word">had been sent from the Pharisees,</span> which amounts to the same thing as "they which were sent were of the Pharisees," and it is after the manner of John to introduce explanatory, retrospective comment, which may throw light on what follows (vers. 41, 45; <a href="/john/4-30.htm">John 4:30</a>; <a href="/john/11-5.htm">John 11:5</a>). The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> of the following verse shows that we have still to do with the same deputation. The Pharisees were accustomed to lustral rites, but had legal points to make as to the authority of any man who dared to impose them upon the sacred nation, and especially on their own section, which made its special boast of ceremonial exactitude and purity. They might justify an old prophet, or the Elijah of Malachi, and still more the Christ himself, should he call men to baptismal cleansing. But the dim mysterious "voice in the wilderness," even if John could prove his words, had no such prescriptive claim. The Pharisaic priests and Levites would take strong views on the baptismal question, and even exalt it into a more eminent place in their thoughts than the fundamental question, "Art thou the very Christ?" The same confusion of essential and accidental elements of religious truth and life was not confined to old Pharisees. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
