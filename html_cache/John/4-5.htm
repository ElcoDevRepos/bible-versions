This area is significant in biblical history, as it was a central location in the land of Samaria, which was often at odds with Judea. The Samaritans were a mixed race, resulting from the Assyrian conquest and resettlement, and they had their own version of the Pentateuch and worship practices, which caused tension with the Jews. Jesus' decision to travel through Samaria and engage with its people was countercultural and demonstrated His mission to reach all people, breaking down ethnic and religious barriers.<p><b>near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph</b><br>This plot of ground is historically significant, as it is associated with Jacob, one of the patriarchs of Israel.

This was the Shom?ron built by Omri, on a hill purchased from Shemer (<a href="/context/1_kings/16-23.htm" title="In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.">1Kings 16:23-24</a>). The city was given by Augustus to Herod the Great, who rebuilt it, and called it after the Emperor, Sebaste, a name which survives in the modern village <span class= "ital">Sebustieh.</span><p><span class= "bld">Sychar</span> involves questions of greater uncertainty. The reading may be regarded as beyond doubt, the attempts to substitute "Sychem," or "Sichem" being obviously made to avoid the topographical difficulty. The older geographers, followed by many modern commentators, suppose the word to be an intentional variation of the word Sychem, by which the Jews expressed their contempt for the city of the Samaritans, the sound being very nearly that of the Hebrew words for "lie" and "drunken." Others suppose the change of termination is a natural dialectic variation. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Ben,</span> the Hebrew for son, as in <span class= "ital">Benjamin,</span> <a href="/genesis/35-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.">Genesis 35:18</a>, which in the later language became <span class= "ital">Bar,</span> as in Simon <span class= "ital">Bar-</span>Jona, <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>.) These explanations assume that Sychar is the same place as Shechem; but it is very improbable that St. John would have spoken of a city so well known as Shechem with the prefix "which is called," or would have thought it necessary to define it as "near to the parcel of ground. . . ." The only other places with the same prefix are Ephraim (<a href="/john/11-54.htm" title="Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.">John 11:54</a>), the Pavement (<a href="/john/19-13.htm" title="When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.">John 19:13</a>), and Golgotha (<a href="/john/19-17.htm" title="And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:">John 19:17</a>), but in the latter instances, as in the mention of Thomas called Didymus (<a href="/john/11-16.htm" title="Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.">John 11:16</a>; <a href="/john/20-24.htm" title="But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.">John 20:24</a>), the words do not imply a soubriquet (comp. Farrar, <span class= "ital">Life of Christ,</span> i. 206, note, and Grove in Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of Bible,</span> "Sychar"), but are a citation of the names in Hebrew and Greek, for the benefit of Greek readers. To assert that Sychar is meant to convey a double meaning is to imply that this would be understood by readers for whom it is necessary to translate Gabbatha and Golgotha, Thomas and Cephas (<a href="/john/1-42.htm" title="And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.">John 1:42</a>), for whom Messias has been rendered in Greek in <a href="/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>, and is to be again in this very discourse (<a href="/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a>). Shechem, moreover, was then known by the Greek name Neapolis, which has become the present <span class= "ital">Napl-s</span> (see Ewald <span class= "ital">in loc.,</span> and comp. Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iv.), and this name would have been as natural in this Gospel as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> Tiberias, which is found in it only (<a href="/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.">John 6:1</a>; <a href="/john/6-23.htm" title="(However, there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)">John 6:23</a>; <a href="/john/21-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.">John 21:1</a>). Nor can it be said that Shechem was near to Jacob's well, for admitting that the old city extended considerably "farther eastward than at present," it must still have been more than a mile distant. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, called Sychar</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>, with all the principal uncials; not <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>, as read by the Elzevir edition of Stephens, with one cursive, 69); not "the city" Shechem - the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;</span> of <a href="/acts/7-16.htm">Acts 7:16</a>, or <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of Josephus (<a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a>) - not Sebaste (Samaria), but "a city," one of the cities requiring special designation beyond its mere name, which would hardly have been necessary, if so renowned a spot as the metropolis of the ancient kingdom, or the ancient patriarchal city of Shechem or Sychem, had been thought cf. The similarity of the names Sychar and Sichem led many to suppose that John confounded either the names or the places. Those who were anxious to undervalue the accuracy of the author have attributed it to mistake. Schenkel still sees the error of a Gentile Christian. Others have supposed that the word meaning "town of drunkards" (<a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>), or "town of liars" <a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>), was intentionally applied by John to <span class="accented">Shechem</span>, or that some provincial pronunciation of the name of the old city had thus been commemorated. Hengstenberg suggested that Sychar was a suburb of Siehem or Shechem, and Robinson placed the latter much nearer to Jacob's welt than the present <span class="accented">Nablous.</span> Tholuck gave a philosophical solution - that <span class="accented">m</span> and <span class="accented">r</span> in the two words, being <span class="accented">liquids</span>, were interchanged; and Meyer at one time held that John simply applied the vulgar name. Jerome ('Quaest. Web. in <a href="/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>.') said it was a corruption of the name Sichem. But Eusebius discriminated Shechem from Sychar in his 'Onomasticon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>; and a place called <span class="accented">Sochar</span> or <span class="accented">Sichra</span> is mentioned, and also its "well," in the Talmud. Delitzsch ('Zeitsehrift flit Luth. Theol.,' 1856) has quoted seven passages which refer to the place as the birthplace of rabbis, and as having been alternately occupied by Jews and Samaritans. Moreover, in late years, Palestine explorers have found, within <span class="accented">half a mile</span> of Jacob's well, a village, <span class="accented">El</span> '<span class="accented">Askar</span>, preserving to the present day the old name. Nor has the name been in late years drawn from this narrative and given to this insignificant village, for a Samaritan chronicle, dating from the twelfth century, preserves the name as <span class="accented">Iskar. A priori</span> it is far more probable that a woman of Sychar, than one of Shechem, should have come to draw water, in consequence of the nearer proximity of the former "city" than of the latter to Jacob's well. It is further characterized <span class="cmt_word">as near to the parcel of ground</span> <span class="cmt_word">which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span> In <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>; <a href="/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> (LXX.); <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, we see that Jacob's treaty with the sons of Humor, and the summary violence of his sons in punishment of Dinah's dishonour, were treated by him as giving him special possession in Shechem (the LXX., in <a href="/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>, have translated the word for "portion," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, erroneously supposing that the word was a proper name, instead of an allusive play on the word "Shechem"), and he solemnly bequeathed it to Joseph. In <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a> we find the bones of Joseph were deposited there. (Knobel translates <a href="/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> as the portion which he, Jacob, (by his sons) <span class="accented">would</span> win (not had won) with sword and bow.) Geiger, 'Urschrift.,' p. 80 (referred to by Edersheim<span class="accented">, i.e.</span>, 1:404), shows that St. John's interpretation of Genesis is perfectly in harmony with rabbinic tradition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
