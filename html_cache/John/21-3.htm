Fishing was Peter's former occupation (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-19</a>), and his decision to return to it may reflect a desire for normalcy or a lack of direction. This moment can be seen as a test of faith, as Peter and the disciples are waiting for further instructions from Jesus. The Sea of Galilee, where this event takes place, was a familiar setting for the disciples, symbolizing a return to their roots. This phrase also highlights Peter's leadership role among the disciples, as his decision influences the others.<p><b>&#8220;We will go with you,&#8221; they said.</b><br>The other disciples' willingness to join Peter underscores their camaraderie and shared uncertainty. This collective decision reflects the close-knit community among the disciples, who often acted together (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>). Their response also indicates a shared sense of purpose and solidarity, even in times of doubt. This moment can be seen as a precursor to their future mission as "fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>), where they will work together to spread the Gospel.<p><b>So they went out and got into the boat,</b><br>The act of getting into the boat signifies a return to their previous way of life, at least temporarily. Boats were essential for fishing on the Sea of Galilee, a major source of livelihood in the region. This action can be seen as a metaphor for the disciples' readiness to embark on a new journey, both literally and spiritually. The boat is also a symbol of the Church, carrying the disciples through the waters of life, guided by Christ.<p><b>but caught nothing that night.</b><br>The lack of success in their fishing efforts can be interpreted as a reminder of their dependence on Jesus. In <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, Jesus tells His disciples, "apart from Me you can do nothing," emphasizing the necessity of divine guidance. The night setting often symbolizes a time of trial or lack of understanding in biblical literature (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>, <a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>).

They are summoned by the most commanding spirit among them to resume what was, for some of them at least, their customary calling. He would seek in humble fashion, along the lines of ordinary duty to his family and himself, the supply of daily wants. According to some writers, Peter felt a presentiment of the coming of his Lord under scenes identical with those of his first call (<a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1-11</a>). According to others, Peter exhibited some of the heart-sickness of deferred hope. On either supposition we see a new illustration of, and testimony to, the character of the man who was so conspicuous an initiator. <span class="cmt_word">They say to him, We also come</span> (or, go) <span class="cmt_word">with thee.</span> They do not "follow" him, as they had been summoned once to follow their Lord; but they are willing, even eager, to accompany the strong-hearted man, and ready to take his lead. They share at once either in his presentiment or in the expression of his delayed hope. <span class="cmt_word">They went forth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the home which they had made for themselves on this well-remembered spot - from Capernaum, which was most probably the early home of Peter, and a spot to which he would naturally revert. <span class="cmt_word">And entered into the ship</span>; the veritable vessel that had often served them on that lake of storms. Though Peter and Andrew, James and John, had left their boats and nets and hired servants, it is not unlikely that members of their two families had retained them. <span class="cmt_word">And that night they took nothing</span>. Let the unusual word be noticed. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> occurs three times in this brief narrative and six times in the Gospel, in the sense of "laying hold," "taking possession of," but nowhere in the synoptists. It occurs, however, in <a href="/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>; Ecclus. 23. 21; and, what is more remarkable, in the sense of "taking animals" in <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); so the LXX. for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span> (<a href="/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>). The night was then, as now, the most convenient time for fishing, and the fruitless effort must have reminded them of the night described in <a href="/luke/5.htm">Luke 5</a>. Some critics have supposed this failure to be parabolic or symbolic of the comparatively barren results of the apostolic ministry to the Jews, while what followed was prophetic of the great success which should accompany their appeal to the Gentiles. But Peter's wonderful success on the Day of Pentecost and on subsequent occasions in dealing with Jews, contradicts this interpretation. The only analogy which offers itself to our minds is the limited success of all their endeavors until the apostles were veritably endowed with power from on high. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Simon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Sim&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4613.htm">Strong's 4613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simon.
