In the cultural context of a Jewish wedding, servants played a crucial role in ensuring the event ran smoothly. Jesus' command to the servants indicates His active participation in the event, foreshadowing His role as a servant leader. This moment also reflects the theme of obedience to divine instruction, which is a recurring motif throughout Scripture, such as in the obedience of Noah in <a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Fill the jars with water.&#8221;</b><br>The jars mentioned were large stone water jars used for Jewish purification rites, as noted earlier in the chapter. This detail underscores the significance of purification in Jewish tradition, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11-15</a>. The act of filling these jars with water, a common and abundant element, sets the stage for a miraculous transformation, symbolizing the new covenant and the transformative power of Jesus' ministry. This act can be seen as a type of Jesus' ability to bring about spiritual cleansing and renewal.<p><b>So they filled them to the brim.</b><br>The servants' action of filling the jars to the brim demonstrates complete obedience and faithfulness to Jesus' command. This detail emphasizes the abundance and completeness of the miracle that is about to occur. The overflowing jars can be seen as a symbol of the overflowing grace and blessings that come through Christ, as echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> and <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>. The fullness of the jars also prefigures the fullness of joy and salvation that Jesus brings, as later illustrated in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is performing His first recorded miracle at the wedding in Cana, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>These individuals are instructed by Jesus to fill the jars with water, playing a crucial role in the unfolding miracle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wedding_at_cana.htm">Wedding at Cana</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a wedding feast in Cana of Galilee, where Jesus performs His first miracle, turning water into wine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/water_jars.htm">Water Jars</a></b><br>Large stone jars used for Jewish ceremonial washing, which Jesus instructs to be filled with water, later transformed into wine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary,_mother_of_jesus.htm">Mary, Mother of Jesus</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in verse 7, she plays a pivotal role in the account by bringing the need to Jesus' attention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_christ's_commands.htm">Obedience to Christ's Commands</a></b><br>The servants' obedience in filling the jars to the brim demonstrates the importance of following Jesus' instructions fully, even when the outcome is not immediately clear.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_christ.htm">Transformation through Christ</a></b><br>Just as water was transformed into wine, Jesus has the power to transform our lives, bringing newness and abundance where there was once emptiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The miracle at Cana encourages believers to act in faith, trusting that Jesus can work beyond our understanding and expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_abundance.htm">Symbolism of Abundance</a></b><br>The overflowing jars symbolize the abundant life Jesus offers, reminding us of His provision and the richness of life in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_servants_in_god's_work.htm">Role of Servants in God's Work</a></b><br>The servants' role highlights that God often uses ordinary people to accomplish His extraordinary purposes, encouraging us to be ready and willing to serve.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_2_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 2:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_authority_in_John_2_7.htm">How does Jesus' command in John 2:7 demonstrate His authority and divine power?
