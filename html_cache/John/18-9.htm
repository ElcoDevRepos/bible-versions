This fulfillment underscores the reliability and authority of Jesus' words.<p><b>&#8220;I have not lost one of those You have given Me.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects Jesus' prayer in <a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>, where He speaks of keeping all those given to Him by the Father, except the "son of perdition" (Judas Iscariot), to fulfill Scripture.

The phrase also connects to the imagery of Jesus as the Shepherd, as seen in <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>, where He assures that no one can snatch His sheep from His hand.

It signals that the arrest scene is unfolding exactly as the Lord had already declared.<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s Gospel repeatedly stresses that nothing happens by chance; every detail follows a divine timetable (<a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>; 7:30; 13:1).<p>&#8226; Jesus had foretold His care for His own in His high-priestly prayer the night before: &#8220;While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording echoes earlier assurances: &#8220;This is the will of Him who sent Me, that I shall lose none of all He has given Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in crisis, Jesus remains sovereign. He directs events so that He alone is taken, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>&#8217;s picture of the silent, willing Lamb.<p>&#8226; The fulfillment theme reminds us that Scripture&#8212;and the words of Jesus&#8212;are unfailingly reliable (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>; 24:35).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I have not lost one of those You have given Me.&#8221;</b><p>The quote reaches back to the upper-room prayer (<a href="/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6&#8211;12</a>), bringing that promise into the gritty reality of the arrest.<p>&#8226; Physical preservation: In the garden, Jesus shields the eleven from immediate danger. By insisting that the mob take only Him, He literally keeps them from being &#8220;lost&#8221; that night (compare <a href="/john/18-8.htm">John 18:8</a> with 18:12).<p>&#8226; Spiritual preservation: The larger promise includes eternal security. &#8220;I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; no one can snatch them out of My hand&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Judas is no contradiction.

Judas was never truly &#8220;given&#8221; to the Son in the saving sense (<a href="/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64</a>,70).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore underscores both Christ&#8217;s past faithfulness and His ongoing commitment to keep every believer to the end (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; In the wider narrative, it also reassures the early church readers&#8212;facing persecution&#8212;that their Savior remains just as vigilant over them (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>; 13:5-6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/18-9.htm">John 18:9</a> highlights Jesus&#8217; absolute control over His arrest and His unwavering commitment to guard every soul entrusted to Him.

Believers today can rest in that same assurance&#8212;our Shepherd who stood firm in Gethsemane still holds us fast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>. The quotation is in many ways suggestive. (1) It is not verbally accurate, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> St. John, quoting the words of Christ, which he has himself recorded a few verses before, is at no pains to reproduce it word for word, but is satisfied in giving the substance of it. This throws light on the general literary habits and feelings of this age and race, and it is in full harmony with the usual practice of quotation in the New Testament. (2) St. John quotes with an application to temporal persecution that which had been spoken of spiritual persecution. This illustrates the kind of way in which words are said to be "fulfilled" in more than one sense. Striking words fix themselves in the mind, and an event occurs which illustrates their meaning, and it is said therefore to fulfil them, though of each fulfilment it can be only part. (Comp. especially Notes on <a href="/john/2-17.htm" title="And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.">John 2:17</a>; <a href="/john/12-38.htm" title="That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?">John 12:38</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) (3) The quotation shows that in the thought of St. John himself, the prayer recorded in John 17 is no <span class= "ital">resume</span> of the words of our Lord, but an actual record of His prayer: he quotes the "saying" as fulfilled, just as he would have quoted a passage from the Old Testament Scriptures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - But John found <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> a deeper reason still. He said this in order that the <span class="cmt_word">word which he spake</span> an hour or two before might be fulfilled, not finally exhausted in its unfathomable depth, but gloriously illustrated, <span class="cmt_word">Concerning those whom thou hast given me, not one of them I lost.</span> This is a proof, as recognized by De Wette and others, that the evangelist was quoting exact words of the Master, not words which he had theologically attributed to him. The temporal safety of the disciples was a means on that dread night of saving their souls from death, as well as their bodies from torture or destruction. "Christ," says Calvin, "continually bears with our weakness when he puts himself forward to repel so many attacks of Satan and wicked men, because he sees that we are not yet able or prepared for them. In short, he never brings his people into the field of battle till they have been fully trained, so that in perishing they do not perish, because there is gain provided for them both in death and in life." The reference of the apostle to <a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a> is, moreover, also one of the numerous proofs which the Gospel itself supplies, that great, Heaven-taught as the apostle was, he stands, with all his inspiration, far below, at least on a different plane, from that occupied by the Lord. His occasional interjections and explanations of his Master's words calmer be put on the same level with the words themselves. Even Reuss finds here a reason for holding the authenticity of many at least of the sayings themselves, while refusing to accept the genuineness of the Gospel as a whole ('Theologic Johannique,' <span class="accented">in loco</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
