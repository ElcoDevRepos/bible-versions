It is important to note that Jesus often used His words to reveal deeper spiritual truths. In the context of <a href="/john/12.htm">John 12</a>, Jesus is addressing the crowd after His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, a significant event that fulfills Old Testament prophecy (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>). His words are meant to prepare His followers for the events that are about to unfold.<p><b>to indicate</b><br>Jesus frequently used symbolic language and actions to convey His message. Here, He is providing a sign or a foreshadowing of what is to come. This is consistent with His teaching style, where He often used parables and metaphors to reveal truths about the Kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34-35</a>).<p><b>the kind of death</b><br>The phrase points to the specific nature of Jesus' impending crucifixion. Crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most serious criminals and was considered a curse under Jewish law (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). This form of death was both a fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>) and a demonstration of the extent of Jesus' sacrifice for humanity's sins.<p><b>He was going to die</b><br>Jesus' death was not an accident or a result of unforeseen circumstances; it was a deliberate act of obedience to the Father's will (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). His death was central to God's redemptive plan, as foretold by the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-7</a>). The crucifixion was the means by which Jesus would atone for sin, offering salvation to all who believe (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking about His impending crucifixion. He is the Son of God, the Messiah, who came to save humanity through His sacrificial death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Present during Jesus' discourse, the crowd is a mix of believers, skeptics, and those curious about His teachings. Their understanding of Jesus' words is limited, and they often misinterpret His message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place. It is significant as the center of Jewish worship and the location where Jesus will be crucified.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion.htm">The Crucifixion</a></b><br>The event Jesus is alluding to, where He will be lifted up on the cross, fulfilling His mission to atone for the sins of the world.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are present and listening to His teachings.

Believers should recognize the intentionality and purpose behind the crucifixion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_the_cross.htm">The Significance of the Cross</a></b><br>The cross is central to Christian faith. It symbolizes not only Jesus' suffering but also His victory over sin and death. Christians are called to embrace the cross in their own lives, understanding its power and significance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>Jesus' death fulfills numerous Old Testament prophecies, affirming the reliability of Scripture and God's sovereign plan. Believers can trust in God's promises and His control over history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus involves understanding and accepting the cost of discipleship, which includes self-denial and bearing one's own cross. This passage challenges believers to consider their commitment to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_suffering.htm">Hope in Suffering</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to face the cross provides hope and encouragement for believers facing trials.
