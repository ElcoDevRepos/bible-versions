John&#8217;s role was to prepare the way for Jesus, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. However, Jesus emphasizes that His own testimony is greater. This is because His works and miracles provide direct evidence of His divine authority and mission. The testimony of John was important, but it was ultimately human. Jesus&#8217; testimony is divine, rooted in His unity with the Father.<p><b>For the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish&#8212;</b><br>The "works" refer to the miracles and teachings of Jesus, which were not random acts but were given by the Father as part of His divine mission. These works include healing the sick, raising the dead, and other signs that demonstrate His authority over creation. In Jewish culture, works were often seen as evidence of one's relationship with God. Jesus&#8217; works fulfill Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the Messiah performing miraculous deeds.<p><b>the very works I am doing&#8212;</b><br>Jesus is actively engaged in His ministry, performing works that reveal His identity as the Son of God. These works are ongoing and visible to those around Him, providing continuous evidence of His divine mission. The present tense "I am doing" indicates that His ministry is active and dynamic, not just a past event. This aligns with the concept of Jesus as the living Word, as described in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>.<p><b>testify about Me that the Father has sent Me.</b><br>The works of Jesus serve as a testimony to His divine origin and mission. They confirm that He is sent by the Father, fulfilling the role of the Messiah. This is a central theme in the Gospel of John, where Jesus&#8217; identity and relationship with the Father are repeatedly emphasized. The concept of being "sent" by the Father underscores Jesus&#8217; authority and purpose, as seen in <a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a> and <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>.

Believe the works, and you will see the Father&#8217;s perfect validation of His Son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) For "hath given Me" read, with the better MSS., <span class= "ital">gave Me.</span> The pronouns in "But I have" and in "that I do," are emphatic.<p>In this verse He returns to the thought of <a href="/john/5-32.htm" title="There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.">John 5:32</a>. The parenthesis in <a href="/context/john/5-33.htm" title="You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.">John 5:33-35</a> show that John was not the other there spoken of, and this verse shows that the special form of witness which He referred to was that of the works, which works He was then doing, and the voice of which they ought to have heard.<p>These "works" are not confined to what we speak of as miracles, but include the several parts of His Messianic work, which it was His food to finish (<a href="/john/4-34.htm" title="Jesus said to them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.">John 4:34</a>), and which He speaks of as finished (<a href="/john/17-4.htm" title="I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.">John 17:4</a>; see Note there). There is a special reference here to the power to quicken and authority to judge, in <a href="/context/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21-22</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(g)</span> <span class="accented">The witness of the works. <span class="cmt_word"></span>But the witness which I have is greater</span> <span class="cmt_word">than</span> [that] <span class="cmt_word">of John</span>. The testimony of John was memorable and uoteworthy in many respects. If the people had accepted it, they would have admitted the Divine authority of One who was "mightier" than John. The synoptic Gospels show that Jesus made a similar appeal to the conscience of his critics on a later occasion (<a href="/matthew/21-25.htm">Matthew 21:25</a>, and parallels). Though John's baptism was "from heaven," and though John's testimony was "great," yet that which accompanied the ministry of Jesus was "greater" still. The words of John were not merely John's words, or they would have been valueless. Moreover, "the testimony that I have" is in itself convincing; it has a Divine, self-evidencing force, which, added to my word, confirms and establishes my claim. The proof or illustration of this is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">For the works which the Father hath given me that I should bring them to completion, the very works, which I am doing, bear witness concerning me, that the Father hath sent me.</span> The works of Christ are his normal activities - the deeds which express the nature and compass of his will, and indicate the qualities of his Person. They would be <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, should any other perform such things or live on such a platform of exalted activity. They are his "works." This term is often used for the special manifestations of his alliance with the supernatural, Divine realm (<a href="/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3</a>; <a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>; <a href="/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25, 32</a>, etc.; John 14:10; 15:24). They are in their fulness and summation the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Lord (<a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>). They are, moreover, "given" to him to "do" or to "finish." This idea is frequently expressed. "All things are <span class="accented">given</span> into his hand" (<a href="/john/3-35.htm">John 3:35</a>), all judgment is <span class="accented">given</span> him to execute (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22, 27</a>). The Father hath <span class="accented">given</span> him self-existence (ver. 26; cf. <a href="/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2, 6, 9, 12, 24</a>; <a href="/john/18-9.htm">John 18:9</a>). It is impossible to dissociate these "works "from those great miracles which ought to command assent to his claims, even if, alas! his bare words are not sufficiently convincing. John's Gospel makes numerous references to these proofs of the Divine commission, these illustrations as well as evidences of his right to speak. But the "works" are not limited to the miraculous healings, to multiplication of breed and wine, and resurrection from the dead. The whole of his work, from his baptism and temptation to his own resurrection from the dead, was his <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. This was made up of all the self-revelation of his life, of all his consecration and sympathy, of all his character, of all the resuscitation of dead souls, of all the joy he was pouring into broken hearts, and all the life he was evoking in moribund humanity. "These works that I am doing bear witness concerning me, that the Father hath sent me." They are of such a character that he confidently declares about them that they proclaim his Divine commission. The entire work, reaching special expression in certain typical acts and deeds, was greater than the verbal testimony which John bare to his mission. All that John said was true, but Christ's "works" prove it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
