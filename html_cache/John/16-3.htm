In the broader context of <a href="/john/16.htm">John 16</a>, Jesus is preparing His disciples for the challenges they will encounter after His departure. Historically, early Christians faced significant persecution from both Jewish authorities and the Roman Empire. This persecution was often driven by a misunderstanding or rejection of Jesus' teachings and the new covenant He established.<p><b>because they have not known</b><br>The lack of knowledge here is not merely intellectual but relational and spiritual. In biblical terms, "knowing" often implies a deep, intimate relationship. The religious leaders of the time, despite their extensive knowledge of the Scriptures, failed to recognize Jesus as the Messiah. This highlights a recurring biblical theme where spiritual blindness prevents individuals from understanding God's truth, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> and <a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>.<p><b>the Father</b><br>The Father refers to God, the first person of the Trinity. In the cultural and religious context of first-century Judaism, God was known as Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. However, Jesus emphasizes a personal relationship with God as Father, which was a radical concept at the time. This relational aspect is central to Jesus' teaching and is a key theme throughout the Gospel of John, as seen in <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a> and <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6-7</a>.<p><b>or Me</b><br>"Me" refers to Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The rejection of Jesus by many of His contemporaries was a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected. Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the promised Messiah is a cornerstone of Christian faith, and recognizing Him is essential for salvation, as stated in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>. The failure to know Jesus is equated with not knowing the Father, underscoring the unity of the Father and the Son in the Godhead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is preparing His disciples for the challenges they will face after His departure.

Note on <a href="/john/15-21.htm" title="But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.">John 15:21</a>. He repeats that ignorance of God is the cause of the world's hatred and persecution, and adds here that it is ignorance of God revealed in Himself. There is a special force in the mention of this ignorance in connection with the previous verse. Men think that in exclusion, and anathemas, and persecutions, and deaths of men made like themselves in the image of God, they are offering to God an acceptable sacrifice. They can know nothing of the true nature of the living Father who pitieth every child, and willeth not the death of a sinner, and gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. They know nothing of the long-suffering and compassion of the Son of Man, who pleaded even for His murderers, "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They will do</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#942;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(poi&#275;sousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
