The context is after the feeding of the 5,000, where the people, witnessing the miracle, saw Jesus as a potential political leader who could liberate them from Roman rule. This reflects the Jewish expectation of a Messiah who would be a political and military leader, as seen in prophecies like those in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>. However, Jesus' kingdom was not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>), and He came to fulfill a spiritual mission rather than a political one. This moment underscores the misunderstanding of Jesus' true purpose and mission by the people.<p><b>withdrew again to a mountain by Himself</b><br>Jesus' withdrawal to a mountain signifies His desire for solitude and communion with the Father, a recurring theme in His ministry (e.g., <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>, <a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>). Mountains in biblical times were often places of prayer and revelation, as seen with Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 19) and Elijah on Mount Horeb (1 Kings 19). This act of withdrawing also demonstrates Jesus' rejection of earthly power and His commitment to His divine mission. It reflects His humility and the importance of prayer and solitude in seeking God's will, setting an example for believers to prioritize spiritual over worldly ambitions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is aware of the crowd's intentions and chooses to withdraw to a mountain alone.

St. Luke does not contain this section, but comp. the question recorded by him in <a href="/john/9-18.htm" title="But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.">John 9:18</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> which grows immediately out of it.<p><span class= "bld">A mountain.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the mountain,</span> or <span class= "ital">the hill-country</span> (<a href="/john/6-3.htm" title="And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.">John 6:3</a>).

They were on the way to Jerusalem, and they were thirsting to throw off the yoke of Rome and of Herod, and probably indignant to the extreme with the "deep damnation" of John the Baptist's death. In such a frame, the display of power and resources which they had just witnessed pointed Jesus out as their popular idol, and encouraged the belief, which did not die out till it was quenched in blood. The bald suggestion would clash absolutely with the Lord's own plan, with the Father's design concerning him. It would seem that the disciples manifested great reluctance to leave Christ or the crowd; for both Matthew (<a href="/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22</a>) and Mark (<a href="/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a>) imply that Jesus had to use special means to induce them to depart (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). He compelled them to do so. If we had nothing but the synoptic narrative to guide us, we might suppose that Jesus had difficulty in resisting the desire of the disciples to remain always at his side; or that the intensity of their affection was interfering too much with the need in which he felt of retirement and solitude. John's statement here illumines the language of the other Gospels. The disciples themselves were strongly moved by the passions of the thousands; they were sharing in the general enthusiasm. To quench such an unholy or unspiritual view of the true Prophet and King, the disciples must be separated from the crowd, and Christ had to overcome by some special utterance of his authority the reluctance of the twelve to embark in their ship. Having done this, and without their help, he sent the multitudes away. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">withdrew</span>, <span class="cmt_word">for the second time, to the mountain</span> (cf. ver. 3), and this time <span class="cmt_word">himself alone.</span> These occasional separations from the apostles were undoubtedly part of the discipline to which they were subjected. They were taught that, when he was no longer visible to them, he might still be spiritually present and able to succour them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
