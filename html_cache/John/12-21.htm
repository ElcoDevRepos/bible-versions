His role as an apostle is significant, as he is often seen as a bridge between Jewish and Gentile believers. This approach to Philip highlights the early church's mission to reach beyond Jewish communities.<p><b>who was from Bethsaida in Galilee</b><br>Bethsaida is a town located on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. It is known as the hometown of several apostles, including Peter, Andrew, and Philip. The region of Galilee was a melting pot of cultures and languages, which may have contributed to Philip's ability to communicate with the Greeks. This geographical detail underscores the diverse background of Jesus' followers.<p><b>and requested of him</b><br>The act of requesting indicates a level of respect and desire for understanding. It reflects the Greeks' genuine interest in Jesus' teachings and their recognition of Philip as a mediator. This request can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy that the nations would seek the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Sir, we want to see Jesus.&#8221;</b><br>The title "Sir" shows respect and acknowledges Philip's position among Jesus' followers. The Greeks' desire to see Jesus signifies a broader interest in His message beyond the Jewish community. This moment foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith, aligning with Jesus' mission to be the Savior of all humanity (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).

This simple action confirms the promise of <a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a> that Christ will &#8220;draw all men&#8221; yet often uses His followers as the first bridge.<p>&#8226; Their movement toward Philip echoes earlier God-directed steps: the Magi traveling to Bethlehem (<a href="/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1&#8211;2</a>) and the Ethiopian official journeying to Jerusalem before meeting Philip the evangelist (<a href="/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27-31</a>). God consistently orchestrates meeting points where seekers find a willing witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was from Bethsaida in Galilee</b><p>&#8226; John reminds us of Philip&#8217;s hometown (also noted in <a href="/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44</a>) because location matters. Bethsaida sat in a region with significant Gentile traffic; Philip likely spoke Greek and understood their culture.<p>&#8226; The setting underscores <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26-27</a>&#8212;God &#8220;determined &#8230; the exact places where they should live&#8221; so people &#8220;would seek Him.&#8221; Philip&#8217;s background uniquely positioned him for this moment.<p>&#8226; Galilee itself had long been prophesied as a place of light for the nations (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, fulfilled in <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-16</a>). The Greeks approaching a Galilean disciple illustrates that prophecy in action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and requested of him</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;requested&#8221; reveals humility and earnest desire. They recognize their need and ask, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; teaching in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>, &#8220;Ask, and it will be given to you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their request mirrors countless encounters where faith begins with a simple petition&#8212;blind Bartimaeus calling out in <a href="/mark/10-47.htm">Mark 10:47</a> or the leper in <a href="/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12</a>. God invites honest approach.<p>&#8226; Notice Philip doesn&#8217;t dismiss them. Like Andrew in <a href="/john/6-8.htm">John 6:8-9</a>, he will soon help others meet Jesus. Believers today share the same privilege described in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>: &#8220;We are ambassadors for Christ.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sir, we want to see Jesus</b><p>&#8226; The heart of the verse is the longing to &#8220;see&#8221; Him. It is more than physical sight; it is a desire to know, to understand, to believe&#8212;as echoed later when Greeks hear Paul in <a href="/acts/17-18.htm">Acts 17:18-20</a>.<p>&#8226; Their respectful &#8220;Sir&#8221; recognizes Jesus&#8217; authority even before personal contact, foreshadowing Thomas&#8217; confession &#8220;My Lord and my God!&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>).<p>&#8226; This cry captures the essence of every seeker&#8217;s quest. Moses asked, &#8220;Show me Your glory&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18</a>). The psalmist yearned, &#8220;My heart says, &#8216;Seek His face!&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>). In Christ, the Father answers those pleas; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a> declares Jesus &#8220;the radiance of God&#8217;s glory.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For believers, the Greeks&#8217; words become a mission statement. Whether preaching (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>), serving (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>), or living daily life (<a href="/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a>), our purpose is to help people see Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a> records Gentile worshipers approaching Philip, the Galilean disciple, and politely pleading, &#8220;Sir, we want to see Jesus.&#8221; Their action fulfills prophecy, showcases God&#8217;s orchestration of backgrounds and locations, and models the humble request that opens the door to saving faith. The verse invites every follower of Christ to be a willing conduit&#8212;ready, like Philip, to lead seeking hearts straight to the Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The same came therefore to Philip.</span>--We have no indication of the time when, or of the place where, these words were spoken. St. John alone gives us this incident, and he gives us this incident only, of all that occurred, as we know from the earlier I Gospels, between the entry into Jerusalem and the Last Supper; and he relates this coming of the Greeks not for the sake of the fact itself, but for that of the discourse which followed upon it. He is careful, therefore, only to mention it, and is not concerned, for the purpose he has in view, with any of the historic details. The last words of the discourse (<a href="/john/12-36.htm" title="While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.">John 12:36</a>) do, however, intimate that they were followed by a retirement from public teaching, and from public appearance in Jerusalem. They would, then,-be among the last words spoken in the Temple before the retirement to-Bethany, on the evening of what we call Wednesday. (Comp. <a href="/luke/21-37.htm" title="And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and stayed in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.">Luke 21:37</a>.) They were uttered, probably, in the Court of the Gentiles, as He passed from the Court of the Women, which, as the most public place for Jewish assemblies, was the frequent scene of His teaching. On the previous day, the Court of the Gentiles had been cleansed from the traffic and merchandise which had been customary in it, and the temple had been declared to be "a house of prayer <span class= "ital">for all nations."</span> The court of the Gentiles was divided from the inner square of the Temple by a stone fence, bearing upon pillars, placed at regular distances, the following words in Greek and Latin:--"No alien must pass within the fence round the Temple and the court. If any one be caught doing so, he must blame himself for the death that will follow." This prohibition was known before, from Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. xv.</span> 11, 5); but in our own day one of the very slabs, bearing the exact words, has been discovered by M. Ganneau during the excavations of the Palestine Exploration Fund. (Comp. Note on <a href="/context/acts/22-28.htm" title="And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.">Acts 22:28-29</a>, and especially the Note on <a href="/mark/11-17.htm" title="And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but you have made it a den of thieves.">Mark 11:17</a>.) The events and the words of these days must have brought strange thoughts to the minds of proselytes, men who were worshippers of the one God by personal conviction, and not because of the faith of their ancestors; and with hearts filled with wonder as to what these things meant--half-grasping, it may be, the truth that this middle wall of partition should be broken down--they ask for a special interview with Jesus. (Comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Which was of Bethsaida of Galilee.</span>--The mention of this place again here seems to intend that it should be told as explaining why these Greeks came to Philip. They may have themselves come from the neighbourhood of Bethsaida, or from one of the Greek cities of Decapolis. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus</span>. The first expression of that great yearning which, swollen by multitudes without number, is loud as the voice of many waters and mighty thunderings. It is the wail of every penitent; it is the birth-cry of every renewed soul; it is the raptured burst of joy as each son of God passes behind the veil The "therefore" implies some kind of previous relation with <span class="accented">Philip</span>, whose somewhat timid, cautious, speculative mind, as hinted in the earlier portions of the Gospel, made him accessible to them. Personal acquaintance is, of course, possible. Was Philip identical with the Aristion of Papias (see Introduction, p. 34, and Archdeacon Farrar, <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, November, 1881)? The mention of Bethsaida of Galilee confirms the suggestion that they were inhabitants of one of the Greek cities of Decapolis, or of the slopes of the Lebanon. Many commentators refer to Philip's Greek name as indicating proclivities or sympathies on his part which would make him peculiarly accessible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(houtoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pros&#275;lthon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4334.htm">Strong's 4334: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and erchomai; to approach, i.e. come near, visit, or worship, assent to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Philip,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#934;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#960;&#960;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(Philipp&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5376.htm">Strong's 5376: </a> </span><span class="str2">From philos and hippos; fond of horses; Philippus, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
