The intent to kill Jesus reflects the increasing tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, who saw Him as a threat to their power and influence. This animosity is rooted in Jesus' claims of divinity and His challenge to their interpretations of the Law. The desire to kill Jesus fulfills the prophetic anticipation of the suffering servant, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-7</a>, where the Messiah is described as being despised and rejected by men.<p><b>a man who has told you the truth</b><br>Jesus emphasizes His humanity here, which is significant in the context of the Incarnation. He is fully God and fully man, a mystery central to Christian theology. The truth He speaks is not just factual but divine revelation, aligning with His role as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). His teachings often challenged the established religious norms, calling people back to the heart of God's commandments rather than mere ritual observance.<p><b>that I heard from God</b><br>This phrase underscores Jesus' unique relationship with the Father, affirming His divine authority. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus frequently speaks of His unity with the Father (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>) and His role as the one who reveals the Father to humanity (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). This claim to divine revelation was a direct challenge to the religious leaders, who prided themselves on their understanding of God and the Law.<p><b>Abraham never did such a thing</b><br>Jesus contrasts the actions of the Jewish leaders with those of Abraham, the patriarch of Israel. Abraham is revered for his faith and obedience to God (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>), and Jesus implies that true children of Abraham would act in faith and righteousness, not in violence and rejection of God's messenger. This reference to Abraham also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant with Abraham and the promise of blessing to all nations through his offspring, ultimately fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Jewish leaders and people, emphasizing His divine mission and the truth He brings from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience Jesus is speaking to, who are plotting against Him due to His claims and teachings that challenge their authority and understanding of the law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Jewish faith, referenced by Jesus to highlight the contrast between Abraham's faithfulness and the current actions of the Jewish leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The source of the truth that Jesus is proclaiming, underscoring the divine authority behind His message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_truth.htm">The Truth</a></b><br>Central to Jesus' mission, representing the divine revelation and the fulfillment of God's promises through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_truth.htm">The Nature of Truth</a></b><br>Jesus embodies and speaks the truth from God.

The verse calls every reader to embrace the truth Jesus brings, walking in Abraham-like faith that welcomes God&#8217;s Word and honors His Messenger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">But now ye seek to kill me</span>--i.e., As a matter of fact, in opposition to the conduct which would characterise the true children of Abraham, ye are seeking to kill Me.

The excitement produced by this bold charge among his own true disciples, and those who now for the first time heard of it, by our Lord's then and there lifting the veil from many a specious question; the look of guilt on the countenances of some, of truculent admission of the charge in the gesture of others; the loud murmurs and confused cries of the crowd, - must all be realized to apprehend the tremendous crisis which had now arrived. He aggravated the charge by describing himself as <span class="cmt_word">a man who hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">declared to you the truth which I heard from God.</span> This is the only place where the Lord speaks of himself as "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">man"</span> (cf. <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). He here describes himself as One who is subject and liable to their murderous passion - <span class="accented">a man</span>, seeing that his eternal Personality has been presented to his antagonists in the form of man. His manhood was the link of relation between the God who sent him, taught him, surrounded and enveloped him, and the consciousness of his hearers. This is the highest representation of the very conception of a Divine commission and a Divine message. They were seeking to stamp out a Divine fire, to drown a heavenly voice, to refuse and trample upon a sacred Messenger. <span class="cmt_word">This did not Abraham.</span> The father of the faithful was susceptible to the heavenly voice, he heard and obeyed the voice of Jehovah with childlike docility (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12, 14, 18, 22</a>.). The visions, the commands, the messengers, the manifestations, of God to Abraham were so readily accepted that his faith is a proverb, and his greatest name is "friend of God." The wilful, hurried, malicious treatment of both the Divine Messenger and the sacred message, both of which Jesus declared to have come directly from God, proves the lack of relation with the Life of Abraham. They might be Abraham's "seed" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) but not his (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) children, and he in this sense could not be their "father." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(nyn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3568.htm">Strong's 3568: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle of present time; 'now'; also as noun or adjective present or immediate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are trying</span><br /><span class="grk">&#950;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#275;teite)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2212.htm">Strong's 2212: </a> </span><span class="str2">To seek, search for, desire, require, demand.
