It reflects the humility and submission of Jesus, who, though fully God, chose to operate within the limitations of His humanity. This dependence is consistent with the theme of Jesus' ministry, where He often withdrew to pray and seek the Father's guidance (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>). It also aligns with the concept of kenosis, the self-emptying of Jesus' own will to fully embrace the Father's will (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p><b>I judge only as I hear.</b><br>Here, Jesus underscores His role as a judge who is perfectly aligned with the Father's will. His judgments are not based on human standards or perceptions but are divinely informed. This reflects the Jewish understanding of a judge who must be impartial and just, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16-17</a>. Jesus' ability to judge as He hears from the Father assures believers of the fairness and righteousness of His judgments, contrasting with the flawed judgments of human leaders.<p><b>And My judgment is just,</b><br>Jesus affirms the righteousness and fairness of His judgments. This statement reassures believers that His decisions are based on divine truth and justice, not on personal bias or external influence. The concept of divine justice is rooted in the Old Testament, where God is portrayed as the ultimate judge who upholds righteousness (<a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>). Jesus, as the embodiment of God's justice, fulfills the messianic prophecies of a righteous judge (<a href="/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3-4</a>).<p><b>because I do not seek My own will,</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' selflessness and His commitment to fulfilling the Father's mission. It contrasts with the human tendency to pursue personal desires and ambitions. Jesus' submission to the Father's will is a central theme in the Gospels, culminating in His prayer in Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). This self-denial serves as a model for believers, encouraging them to prioritize God's will over their own.<p><b>but the will of Him who sent Me.</b><br>Jesus identifies His mission as being sent by the Father, emphasizing His divine authority and purpose. This sending motif is prevalent in John's Gospel, where Jesus frequently refers to being sent by the Father (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17, 6</a>:38). It underscores the divine origin of His mission and His role as the Messiah. The concept of being sent also connects to the Old Testament prophets, who were sent by God to deliver His message (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>). Jesus, as the ultimate prophet, priest, and king, fulfills these roles perfectly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, emphasizing His dependence on the Father and His role as a just judge.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who sent Jesus, whose will Jesus seeks to fulfill.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience of Jesus' discourse, who were questioning His authority and actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The location where this discourse takes place, specifically after Jesus healed a man on the Sabbath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_at_bethesda.htm">The Healing at Bethesda</a></b><br>The event preceding this discourse, where Jesus healed a man, leading to controversy with the Jewish leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Jesus models complete reliance on the Father, teaching us to depend on God in all aspects of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/just_judgment.htm">Just Judgment</a></b><br>Jesus' judgments are just because they align with God's will, reminding us to seek God's guidance in our decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/submission_to_god's_will.htm">Submission to God's Will</a></b><br>Jesus' commitment to the Father's will challenges us to prioritize God's desires over our own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_with_the_father.htm">Unity with the Father</a></b><br>Jesus' unity with the Father serves as a model for our relationship with God, striving for alignment with His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_god.htm">Listening to God</a></b><br>Jesus judges as He hears from the Father, encouraging us to cultivate a listening heart to discern God's voice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_5_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 5:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_5_30_Jesus_submits_to_God_s_will.htm">How does John 5:30 emphasize Jesus' submission to the Father's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_authority_in_I_can_do_nothing.htm">What does "I can do nothing by Myself" teach about Jesus' divine authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_5_30_Phil_2_7-8_on_Jesus_humility.htm">How does John 5:30 connect to Philippians 2:7-8 about Jesus' humility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_not_My_will_daily.htm">How can we apply "I seek not My own will" in daily decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_s_will_guide_truth_and_justice.htm">What role does seeking God's will play in discerning truth and justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_5_30_show_Jesus_submission.htm">How does John 5:30 demonstrate Jesus' submission to the Father's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_5_30_Jesus_authority_judgment.htm">What does John 5:30 reveal about Jesus' divine authority and judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_5_30_vs_Trinity_A_challenge.htm">How does John 5:30 challenge the concept of the Trinity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'great_nation'_mean.htm">Can the Son do anything by Himself?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_the_son_do_anything_by_himself.htm">Can the Son do anything by Himself?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_sin_that_leads_to_death.htm">What is the sin that leads to death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_can't_jesus_choose_who_sits_by_him.htm">Matthew 20:23 &#8211; If Jesus is fully divine, why does He imply He has no authority over who sits at His right and left? </a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 5:30 Mean</div><b>I can do nothing by Myself</b><p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; words echo <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>, &#8220;the Son can do nothing by Himself.&#8221; He is equal with the Father in essence yet freely submits in function (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; His dependence illustrates perfect unity, not weakness.

Moreover, the equality of "life" and "honour" and "authority" that he has with the Father, as the veritable Son of God, is nevertheless a life derived, a being generated, an honour given. He here opens up on this basis a new class of instruction, and proceeds to explain the threefold nature of the testimony borne to his present claim to be the Representative and coAgent of the Father. He goes back in these words to the great text of the discourse, viz. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" (ver. 19). I (the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span> is very emphatic, the individual standing before them associates himself, and is identified, with the one Being who, as Son of God and Son of man, has done, is doing, and will yet do, wonderful things) - <span class="cmt_word">I can of mine own self,</span> from any separate or self-originating source in myself, apart from the Father, <span class="cmt_word">do nothing.</span> He subsequently said to his disciples, "Without me ye can do nothing." He claims a higher source than himself for all his own power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). When referring to the same subject (vers. 19, 20), he drew his illustration from the sense of sight. The Father "shews" to him, and he "sees" all things that the Father doeth. Here he adds, with special reference to the last and consummating manifestation of relation with the Father, <span class="cmt_word">As I hear, I judge: and my judgment of men is righteous; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him</span> <span class="cmt_word">who sent me</span>. Christ refers to his judgments of absolution or condemnation upon things or men, positively declaring them to be either right or wrong; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> he claimed the power to say, "Thy sins be forgiven;" "The faith hath saved thee;" "It is better for this man that he had never been born;" "Come unto me;" "Depart from me;" "I never knew you." These and all his other judgments on scribes and Pharisees, on devils and hypocrites, on Pilate and Herod, on Jerusalem and the world, are revelations of the Father's mind - are in themselves just judgments, absolutely free from any selfhood, from any reflex influence or reaction from men to himself. They are the true and infallible expression of the Divine will. Because of the entire conformity of his will and himself to the Divine will, the judgment must correspond to that which is, in its very nature, right and true. If this be so, we can scarcely refrain from asking, "Wherein, then, lies the consolation and encouragement derivable from the fact that the execution of judgment is placed for man's sake in the hands of the Son of man?" It lies here, that the Incarnation is perfect; that the manhood has not obliterated the Divinity, nor the Godhead absorbed the manhood, of the Christ. The human consciousness of the Son becomes the basis for the Father's judgment, which is uttered thus absolutely and finally through human lips. It is impossible to imagine thoughts like these arising in the mind of some thinker of the second century. Great as the prologue to this Gospel unquestionably is, this unveiling of the heart of the Son of God incarnate is immeasurably greater. The consciousness of Christ is unique. Neither legend nor imagination, to say nothing of history, has ever transcended it. Here, too, the enormous difference between the Johannine Christ and the Philonic Logos comes into startling prominence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
