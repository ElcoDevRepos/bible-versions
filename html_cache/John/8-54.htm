This dialogue occurs during the Feast of Tabernacles, a time when Jesus was teaching in the temple courts. His response is part of a larger discourse where He reveals His divine nature and relationship with the Father.<p><b>If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing.</b><br>Here, Jesus emphasizes the principle of humility and divine validation. In Jewish culture, self-promotion was often viewed with skepticism. Jesus contrasts human glory with divine approval, indicating that true honor comes from God, not self-exaltation. This reflects the biblical theme that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>The One who glorifies Me is My Father,</b><br>Jesus identifies God the Father as the source of His glory. This statement underscores the intimate relationship between Jesus and the Father, a recurring theme in the Gospel of John. It also points to the divine endorsement of Jesus' mission and identity, as seen in events like His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>) and transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>), where the Father publicly affirms Him.<p><b>of whom you say, &#8216;He is our God.&#8217;</b><br>Jesus addresses the Jewish leaders' claim to know and worship the true God. This phrase highlights the irony and tension in the narrative: the religious leaders profess allegiance to God yet fail to recognize His Son. It echoes the prophetic critique found in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God condemns those who honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him. Jesus challenges their understanding and calls them to a deeper recognition of God's work through Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the Jewish leaders, emphasizing His relationship with the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>- God the Father, who glorifies Jesus, affirming His divine authority and mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>- The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, who claim God as their own but fail to recognize Jesus as the Son of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The setting of this discourse, a city central to Jewish religious life and the location of many of Jesus' teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>- While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the broader context of <a href="/bsb/john/8.htm">John 8</a> suggests that this conversation takes place in or near the Temple, a significant place for Jewish worship and teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_glory.htm">Understanding True Glory</a></b><br>Jesus teaches that self-glorification is meaningless.

In a culture where religious leaders loved public applause (<a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1-2</a>), Jesus refuses to play that game.
