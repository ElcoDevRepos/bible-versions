His finding of Nathanael signifies the importance of personal testimony in the Christian faith. Nathanael, also known as Bartholomew, is introduced here, highlighting the relational aspect of Jesus' ministry. This encounter emphasizes the pattern of disciples bringing others to Jesus, a theme seen throughout the New Testament.<p><b>We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law</b><br>This phrase refers to the Messianic prophecies found in the Pentateuch, particularly <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, where Moses speaks of a prophet like himself whom God will raise up. The Law, or Torah, is foundational to Jewish belief, and the identification of Jesus as the fulfillment of these writings underscores His divine mission and authority. This connection to Moses would resonate deeply with Jewish audiences, affirming Jesus as the anticipated Messiah.<p><b>The One the prophets foretold</b><br>The prophets, including Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others, spoke extensively about the coming Messiah. <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> are examples of prophecies that point to Jesus' life and mission. This phrase highlights the continuity of God's plan through the Old Testament, fulfilled in Jesus. The prophetic tradition provides a rich tapestry of expectation that Jesus embodies, affirming His role as the culmination of God's redemptive history.<p><b>Jesus of Nazareth</b><br>Nazareth, a small town in Galilee, was often looked down upon, as seen in Nathanael's later question, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>). Jesus' association with Nazareth fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light coming from Galilee. This geographical detail emphasizes the humble and unexpected origins of the Messiah, challenging preconceived notions of power and prestige.<p><b>The son of Joseph</b><br>Referring to Jesus as the son of Joseph acknowledges His earthly lineage and legal paternity, connecting Him to the house of David, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. While Joseph is not Jesus' biological father, this title affirms His rightful place within Jewish heritage and fulfills the Messianic expectation of descent from David. This phrase also underscores the mystery of the Incarnation, where Jesus is both fully divine and fully human.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles of Jesus, who plays a role in bringing others to Christ.

Nathanael is initially skeptical about Jesus being the Messiah because of His association with Nazareth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is the lawgiver and leader of the Israelites.

He is, perhaps, the same person as Bartholomew; but on this, see <a href="/john/21-2.htm" title="There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.">John 21:2</a>, and Note on <a href="/matthew/10-3.htm" title="Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;">Matthew 10:3</a>. The more formal statement of the proof in this case, as compared with that of the two brothers (<a href="/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>), agrees with the general character of Philip and with the less close relationship. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="accented">Further convictions of the disciples.</span> (<span class="accented">b</span>) <span class="accented">The theme of the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Philip findeth Nathanael.</span> He has no sooner accepted the Lord who found him, than he is eager to communicate the Divine secret to others. It seems widely accepted, though without any positive proof, that this Nathanael was identical with the Bartholomew (Bar Tolmai, son of Ptolemy) of the four lists of apostles, on the following grounds: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> In <a href="/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a> Nathanael once more appears among the innermost circle of the apostles, and is moreover mentioned there in company with Thomas. In the synoptic Gospels Bartholomew is associated also with Philip, although in Acts, Luke ranks him with Matthew. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is probable that Nathanael was one of the twelve, and, this being so, it is more probable that he should have been identical with Bartholomew than with any other, he is distinguished from Thomas and the two sons of Zebedee in <a href="/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>, and the whole circumstance of his call suggests no resemblance to that of Matthew. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> His well known name is only that of a patronymic, and suggests the existence of another and a personal name. This identification cannot be proved, but there is no other that is more probable. Nathanael (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>), as a name in Hebrew, is identical with Theodorus, "God is giver" (<a href="/numbers/1-8.htm">Numbers 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/2-14.htm">1 Chronicles 2:14</a>; see also 1 Esdras 1:9 1 Esdras 9:22). Thoma ('Die Genesis des Johannes-Evangeliums,' p. 409, etc.) endeavours to identify Nathanael with Matthew, and to institute a series of ingenious comparisons between the synoptic "Matthew and Zacchaeus" and this Israelite without guile, and to compare the marriage feast at Nathanael's "Cana" with the feast in Matthew's, or Levi's, house. The subtle fancy and dramatic moral which he attributes to every clause of the narrative render the authorship a greater puzzle than ever. Philip <span class="cmt_word">saith unto him, We have found</span> - we, the group of friends already illumined with the sublime hope - <span class="cmt_word">him of whom Moses in the Law, and the prophets, wrote.</span> This reveals the characteristics of the conversation which had passed between the Lord and the favoured three. It corresponds with what occurred on the way to Emmaus. The Lord rested upon the germinant ideas, and prophetic hopes, suggestive types, and positive predictions of the Old Testament, and met, while he refined and elevated, the current expectations of his time. There was to be no break with the old covenant, except by fulfilling it, establishing its reality and its vast place in the revelation of the supreme will of God. The question naturally arises, "Well, but who is he? what is his name? whither has he come? whence does he hail?" The continuation of the sentence is obviously not in apposition with the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, but the direct object of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">We have found Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Son of Joseph of Nazareth</span>. This is the simple utterance of a matter of fact - a current piece of intelligence now circulating in the group of the earliest disciples. The idea of his being Joseph's Son was widely diffused; the fact that the Lord spent the first thirty years of his human life in Nazareth, was a commonplace of the synoptic story. The argument of the Tubingen and Straussian criticism, that the fourth evangelist was ignorant of Christ's Birth from above, is contradicted by the prologue, with all the assertions of the Lord's pre-existence, and especially by ver. 14 with <a href="/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>, and 13. That he was ignorant of the birth in Bethlehem, with the numberless proofs of his knowledge of Matthew's and Luke's Gospels, is absurd. The language put into Philip's lips does not exhaust the knowledge of the evangelist on this subject (cf. <a href="/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Philip</span><br /><span class="grk">&#934;&#943;&#955;&#953;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Philippos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5376.htm">Strong's 5376: </a> </span><span class="str2">From philos and hippos; fond of horses; Philippus, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">found</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#8017;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Heuriskei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nathanael</span><br /><span class="grk">&#925;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#8052;&#955;</span> <span class="translit">(Nathana&#275;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3482.htm">Strong's 3482: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Nathanael, an Israelite and Christian.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">him,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
