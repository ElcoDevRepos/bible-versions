The Pharisees are skeptical and seek to discredit the miracle. This reflects their broader opposition to Jesus, as they often questioned His authority and sought to undermine His works (<a href="/matthew/12-14.htm">Matthew 12:14</a>). The question also highlights the Pharisees' focus on the actions of Jesus rather than the miraculous outcome, indicating their spiritual blindness and inability to recognize the divine nature of Jesus' works (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>).<p><b>&#8220;they asked.&#8221;</b><br>The Pharisees' repeated questioning of the healed man demonstrates their persistent disbelief and unwillingness to accept the miracle as a sign of Jesus' messianic identity. This interrogation is part of a larger pattern of religious leaders challenging Jesus' authority and miracles (<a href="/john/5-16.htm">John 5:16-18</a>). Their questioning also serves to intimidate the man and his family, as acknowledging Jesus' divine power could lead to expulsion from the synagogue (<a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>).<p><b>&#8220;How did He open your eyes?&#8221;</b><br>This question focuses on the method of the miracle, reflecting the Pharisees' preoccupation with legalistic details rather than the spiritual significance. The miracle of restoring sight to the blind is a fulfillment of messianic prophecy, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened. The act of giving sight is symbolic of spiritual enlightenment and the revelation of truth, themes central to Jesus' ministry (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).

They want facts minus faith.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6-7</a> records the plain facts: &#8220;He spat on the ground, made mud, and applied it to my eyes&#8230; I went and washed, and I received my sight.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Like the leaders in <a href="/acts/4-16.htm">Acts 4:16-17</a> who admit a notable miracle yet seek to suppress its impact, these men recognize something has happened but resist where that evidence points.<p>&#8226; Their question also echoes <a href="/john/5-10.htm">John 5:10-12</a>, where another healing on the Sabbath triggers legalistic outrage instead of praise.<p>- For us, the line exposes how unbelief reduces Christ&#8217;s works to data points while sidestepping the demand for worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they asked.</b><p>- Repetition of inquiry (<a href="/john/9-15.htm">John 9:15, 24, 26</a>) shows a strategy: wear down the witness and find inconsistencies.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/11-53.htm">Luke 11:53-54</a> describes this interrogative approach: &#8220;they began to press Him hard&#8230; lying in wait for Him, to catch Him in something He might say.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their persistence contrasts with the healed man&#8217;s growing boldness (<a href="/john/9-25.htm">John 9:25, 27</a>-30). Truth strengthens the simple; skepticism fractures the sophisticated.<p>- The phrase &#8220;they asked&#8221; underlines accountability: every person must ultimately face the evidence of Jesus&#8217; works and decide (<a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18-19</a>). Deflecting with endless questions does not erase the testimony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How did He open your eyes?</b><p>- Here the leaders spotlight method, not meaning. Yet the very wording concedes a miracle: eyes were shut, now open.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a> foretells, &#8220;Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,&#8221; a direct Messianic sign fulfilled in Jesus (<a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a> affirms, &#8220;The LORD opens the eyes of the blind,&#8221; showing the act belongs to God alone&#8212;therefore pointing to Jesus&#8217; divine identity (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>).<p>- More than physical, the question hints at spiritual sight. Later Jesus applies the episode to heart-vision: &#8220;For judgment I have come&#8230; so that the blind will see&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a> connects both realms: God &#8220;made His light shine in our hearts&#8221; just as at creation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a> prays for &#8220;the eyes of your heart&#8221; to be enlightened. The same One who touched optic nerves can, and must, illumine souls.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-26.htm">John 9:26</a> captures a clash between undeniable wonder and willful unbelief. The leaders focus on the mechanics&#8212;&#8220;What did He do&#8230; How did He open your eyes?&#8221;&#8212;while ignoring the miracle&#8217;s message: Jesus is the promised Light who grants sight inside and out. Their repeated questioning exposes hardened hearts; the healed man&#8217;s straightforward testimony magnifies Christ. The verse therefore calls every reader to move from analyzing the event to adoring the Savior who alone opens eyes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Then said they to him again.</span>--Failing to establish their denial of the fact, they repeat their questionings as to the means used. They hope, it may be, to detect some difference in the accounts, or something which they can construe into a charge against our Lord; or, perhaps, as some have suggested, their repeated questions are merely to gain time or cover their retreat. His honest boldness is too much for their craft. Their adjuration to speak as in God's presence has been answered in a way they little expected, and the questions they now repeat are asked because they know not what to say.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said therefore to him</span>,<span class="cmt_word">What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</span> They sought to draw from him the explicit proof that Jesus had broken the sabbath, or possibly to entangle him in some different statement. The fact of the supernatural change is practically conceded to the obstinacy of the man's reiterated declaration, and the identification of his person by others. Westcott here differs from the majority of recent expositors, and supposes that the "questions suggest that they were willing to believe if the facts were not decisive against belief." But the answer of the man proves that he saw the cunning of his antagonists, and was irritated by their conspicuous design to twist the infinite benefit that he had received into the material of a charge against his Benefactor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
