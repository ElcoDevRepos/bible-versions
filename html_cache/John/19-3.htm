The Roman soldiers, who were likely Gentiles, did not understand the significance of Jesus' kingship. Their actions fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected. The repetition underscores the intensity of the humiliation, as Jesus was subjected to continuous scorn.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221;</b><br>The soldiers' mockery of Jesus as "King of the Jews" is deeply ironic. While they intended to ridicule, they inadvertently acknowledged a profound truth. This title was also used by the Magi in <a href="/matthew/2-2.htm">Matthew 2:2</a> when they sought the newborn Jesus, indicating His royal lineage as a descendant of David. The phrase "Hail" mimics the Roman salute to Caesar, further mocking Jesus' claim to kingship. This mockery fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, where the suffering servant is scorned by those around Him.<p><b>and slapping Him in the face.</b><br>The act of slapping Jesus was a physical manifestation of the contempt and rejection He faced. In the cultural context of the time, striking someone on the face was a severe insult, signifying utter disrespect. This act of violence fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, where the servant of the Lord offers His back to those who beat Him and His cheeks to those who pull out His beard. The physical abuse Jesus suffered is a type of the suffering servant, illustrating His role as the sacrificial Lamb who endures humiliation and pain for the sake of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being mocked and physically abused in this passage.

The hours of that day may well be confused, for their sorrow would have made minutes seem as hours, and the sun, which on other days marked the hours, was on that day itself darkened.

The awful indignity was a wondrous prophecy. Nay, from that very hour he began to reign. That crown of thorns has been more lasting than any royal diadem. Those cruel insults have been the title-deeds of his imperial sway, by which he has mastered the nations. He was wounded, bruised, for the iniquities of us all. The representatives of the outside world thus share expressly in the shame and ban by which the Hebrew theocracy is crushed, and the prince of this world is judged.
