His action here reflects his impulsive and dedicated nature, as seen throughout the Gospels. The act of dragging the net ashore signifies Peter's role in bringing the catch, symbolizing the gathering of believers into the Church. This scene occurs after the resurrection of Jesus, on the Sea of Galilee, a familiar setting for the disciples, who were fishermen by trade. The physical effort required to drag the net underscores the abundance of the catch, hinting at the spiritual harvest to come.<p><b>It was full of large fish, 153,</b><br>The specific number, 153, has intrigued scholars and theologians. Some suggest it represents the universality of the Gospel, as ancient writers like Jerome noted that there were 153 known species of fish, symbolizing all nations. Others see it as a literal count, emphasizing the miraculous nature of the catch. The large fish indicate the significance and value of the catch, paralleling the importance of each soul brought to faith. This miraculous provision echoes Jesus' earlier miracle of the feeding of the 5,000, demonstrating His lordship over creation.<p><b>but even with so many, the net was not torn.</b><br>The intact net symbolizes the unity and strength of the Church, which, despite the diversity and multitude of believers, remains whole and unbroken. This imagery aligns with Jesus' prayer for unity among His followers in <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17</a>. The unbroken net also contrasts with the earlier incident in <a href="/luke/5-6.htm">Luke 5:6</a>, where the net began to break, highlighting the completeness and sufficiency of Christ's provision post-resurrection.

This would be talked of among the Apostles and their friends and fellow-craftsmen, and is, with the picturesque exactness which is characteristic of St. John, recorded here.<p>We have no clue to any mystical interpretation of this number, and it is probably not intended to convey one. The various meanings which men have read into it, such as that it represents one of every kind of fish known to the natural history of the day; or that one hundred represents the Gentile nations, fifty the Jews, and three the Trinity; or that there is a reference to the 153, 600 proselytes of <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.">2Chronicles 2:17</a>; or that it expresses symbolically the name of Simon Peter, take their place among the eccentricities of exegesis from which even the latest results of criticism are not free. Still, as all the more spiritual interpreters, from St. Augustine downwards, have seen, the differences between this and the earlier miracle (<a href="/context/luke/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed on him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,">Luke 5:1-11</a>) are too striking to be unintentional. That represents the visible Church, containing good and bad; the net is cast without special direction as to side; the net was broken and many escaped. This represents God's elect, foreknown by Him; all are good; the net is brought to shore, and none are lost. (See Notes on the parable of the Draw-net in <a href="/context/matthew/13-47.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:">Matthew 13:47-50</a>, and comp. especially Trench, <span class= "ital">Notes on Miracles,</span> ?? 3 and 33.)<p><span class= "bld">Yet was not the net broken.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="/luke/5-6.htm" title="And when they had this done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.">Luke 5:6</a>. This is again one of the details which point to an eye-witness as the writer. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Simon Peter went up</span>. Here again Simon is first in action, as John is the more rapid and real in his mental processes. The other disciples may have aided him, following his lead; but the singular verbs are used on both occasions (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). In like manner, though the twelve apostles took part in the transactions of Pentecost, Peter opened his mouth to speak. On other occasions, while John spake by the eloquent glances of his eye, and the rest of the disciples joined their leader in testimony and prayer, Peter's voice was that which conveyed the mighty exultation of their common heart (<a href="/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>, etc.; Acts 4:8, etc.; Acts 8:20, etc.; Acts 10:34-11:30; 15:7-11). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>, "went up," must be explained by the fact that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is used of embarking in a vessel (<a href="/john/21-3.htm">John 21:3</a>; <a href="/mark/6-51.htm">Mark 6:51</a>; <a href="/acts/21-6.htm">Acts 21:6</a>), though in each case there is some difference in the manuscripts, with reference to the text, as there is also here. If the vessel was drawn up on the shore, with the net attached to it, the form of expression is explicable. Peter went up into the boat for the lines of the net, and, having secured it, <span class="cmt_word">he drew the net to the land</span>, <span class="cmt_word">full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three.</span> Various efforts have been made from early times to give some symbolic meaning to this enumeration. Canon Westcott has detailed several of these strange guesses. Cyril of Alexandria set the example, and was followed by Ammonius the presbyter, who both in different ways regarded the 3 as representative of the Trinity, the 100 + 50 representing, in different proportions, the success of the apostolic ministry among Gentiles and Jews. Augustine observes that 10 is the number of the Law, and 7 the number of the Spirit, 10 + 7 = 17; and the numbers from 1 + 2 + 3 + 17 = 153; so that the number represents all who are brought to God under every dispensation of grace. Gregory the Great reaches the value 17 in the same fashion as Augustine, but, says he, it is only by faith in the Trinity that either Jew or Gentile ever reaches the fullness of salvation; 17 is therefore multiplied by 3 = 3 x 17, which produces 51, which is the number of true rest; multiplied again by 3, which completes the glory of the perfected, it is 153. Hengstenberg, following Grotius, supposes a reference to the 153,600 Canaanitish proselytes who were received into the kingdom in Solomon's day (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a>)! though the odd 600 certainly confuse the reckoning. Jerome refers to the opinion of a learned naturalist of the second century, Oppian, who is said to have ascertained that there were 153 different kinds of fish in the seas, and that the apostles took of every kind, revealing the ultimate success of the fishers of souls with every kind of man - an allegory based on false science and insecure data, and involving a stupendous miracle, if it be meant for an historical fact. Several of the modern T&uuml;bingen school, in various but unsatisfactory ways, see in the number one made up by the letters composing the name of Simeon (71) bar (22) Jonah (31) Kephas (29); and here even Keim follows suit. Thoma finds the number in the mystic <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3a7;&#x398;&#x3a5;&#x3a3;</span>, "Jesus Christ the Son of God, Savior." Reuss discourages mystical or occult meaning. The remark of Baumgarten-Crusius, that the number is simply an index of the authenticity of the narrative, and of the fact that the fishes were counted on the occasion, is eminently sensible (so Godet and Meyer). The fact that it is not a round number adds to the probability of this statement, and enters a caveat against allegorical interpretation. And for all they were so many, the net was not rent. This is obviously a point of contrast with the first miraculous draught of fishes, when the nets brake and the boats began to sink. This does form a probable allegory of the success with which the final ingathering of souls shall be effected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
