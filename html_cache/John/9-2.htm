This question indicates their curiosity and desire to understand the relationship between sin and suffering, a common theme in Jewish thought. The disciples' inquiry also shows their trust in Jesus as a teacher who could provide insight into complex issues.<p><b>&#8220;Rabbi, who sinned</b><br>The title "Rabbi" signifies respect and acknowledges Jesus as a teacher. The question reflects a prevalent belief in Jewish culture that suffering, such as illness or disability, was a direct result of personal sin or the sin of one's ancestors. This belief is rooted in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, which speaks of the sins of the fathers being visited upon the children. The disciples' question reveals their struggle with understanding the nature of sin and its consequences.<p><b>this man or his parents</b><br>The mention of the man or his parents highlights the two primary explanations for suffering in Jewish thought: personal sin or ancestral sin. The idea that a person could sin before birth, possibly in the womb, was a topic of debate among Jewish scholars. Alternatively, the concept of generational sin, where the sins of the parents affect their children, was a common interpretation of certain Old Testament passages.<p><b>that he was born blind?&#8221;</b><br>The condition of being born blind presents a theological dilemma for the disciples, as it challenges the notion of personal sin being the cause of suffering. This question sets the stage for Jesus to address and correct misunderstandings about the relationship between sin and suffering. The healing of the blind man later in the chapter serves as a demonstration of Jesus' power and authority, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in the Gospel of John, Jesus is the Rabbi (teacher) whom the disciples are questioning.

Not every hardship is punitive; some become platforms where the Lord&#8217;s power and compassion shine, inviting us to trust Him and look for His glory in every circumstance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Who did sin, this man, or his parents?</span>--The disciples noticed that He looked at the man, and it may be that He halted as He was walking by. Their attention is directed to the sufferer, and with suffering they connect the idea of sin. They ask a question which may have come to them many times before, and which has in various forms come to men's hearts many times since. Some of them may have heard it discussed in Rabbinic schools, and may have wished to know what answer He whom they had come to regard as greater than the Rabbis, would give. But it is a question not of the learned only, but of men generally, and those who now ask it do not propound it as a matter for discussion, but as a mystery of human life brought home to them in all its darkness, and for which they seek a solution at His hands. His teaching on the wider questions of the existence of evil and the connection of sin and suffering, though coming in the order of events after these words, and in part probably arising out of them, has in the order of the record occurred before them, and has been already dealt with in Notes on <a href="/context/luke/13-1.htm" title="There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.">Luke 13:1-5</a>. What is special to the question, as it meets us here, is that what is deemed to be the punishment had come with birth before possibility of thought or action, and therefore, as we think, before possibility of sin.<p>The form of the question puts two alternatives on precisely the same grounds; and we have no right therefore to assume that one of them is excluded by the questioners themselves. The fact of sin is stated as beyond question. The problem is, "Was the sin that of the man himself, or that of his parents?" The latter alternative is familiar to us, and daily experience shows us that within limits it holds good in both the moral and the physical worlds. It was clearly taught in the Second Commandment, and there is abundant evidence that the belief was at this time widely spread. We have greater difficulty in tracing the origin of the former alternative. It is not easy to accept the view that they thought of sin in his mother's womb, though it seems certain that the Jews currently interpreted such passages as <a href="/genesis/25-22.htm" title="And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.">Genesis 25:22</a>, and <a href="/psalms/51-5.htm" title="Behold, I was shaped in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.">Psalm 51:5</a> in this sense. That a more or less definite belief in the transmigration of souls was common among Jews at the time of our Lord's ministry, is made probable by references in Philo and Josephus. We know it was a doctrine of the Essenes and of the Cabbala; and we find it in the nearly contemporary words of the Wisdom of Solomon, "Yea rather being good, I came into a body undefiled" (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-20.htm" title="Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.">Wisdom Of Solomon 8:20</a>). Still it has been urged that it is not likely that such a belief would have made its way among the fishermen of Galilee. We have to remember, however, that among the disciples there are now men of Jerusalem as well as of Galilee, and that questions which men found hard to understand were constantly being raised and answered in the Rabbinic schools. In the meetings of the yearly festivals the answers of great Rabbis would be talked over and become generally known, and be handed on as maxims to those who knew little of the principle on which they were based. It was, then, probably with some thought that the life in this maimed body may not have been the first stage of his existence, that they ask, Did this man sin?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi.</span> This honorific appellation is found in <a href="/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38, 49</a>; <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>; <a href="/john/4-31.htm">John 4:31</a>; <a href="/john/6-25.htm">John 6:25</a>; <a href="/john/11-8.htm">John 11:8</a>; but very rarely in the other Gospels. It is applied to John the Baptist (<a href="/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>). The question seems to denote a very different frame of mind from that with which the previous chapter terminated. <span class="cmt_word">Who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</span> It was the current idea and popular doctrine, not only that all suffering in this life had its origin in sin, and was a witness to the damage done to our nature by sin, by the disruption of our normal relations with the living God, but furthermore that every peculiar disaster pointed to some special or particular sin. Doubtless the Book of Job was a formal discussion of the question. The writer of that work repudiates the right of any onlooker to infer special sins from peculiar punishments. Jesus, moreover (<a href="/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1-3</a>); had repeatedly discouraged the tendency to judge, but he did this by the still more solemn assurance that all men deserved the special fate of some. Still, the calamity of congenital blindness, with all its hopelessness, provided a very apt occasion for raising the question, "Who did sin, this man, or his parents?" It is and always will be difficult to say whether the disciples thought that they had exhausted the alternatives, or believed that they had plausible reasons for thinking either alternative possible. Some have argued that they had Scripture ground for the second of the suppositions, that the sin of the parents of the blind man was the real cause of the blindness of their son. Thus (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>) the idea is embedded in the Decalogue, and it is repeated in <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a> and <a href="/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>, that the iniquities of fathers are visited upon their children. The forty years in the wilderness was a case in point (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33, 34</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>), and numerous examples may be given of the punishment descending from parent to child; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, upon the house of Ahab, and on the sufferers from exile in Babylon. Compare the continuous threatening of vengeance for unfaithfulness upon the generation to come. The argument may have been strengthened by observation of the lot of men who have brought poverty, disease, and disgrace upon their unborn children. Ezekiel had deliberately repudiated the inference that Israel had drawn from their Scriptures, in the dictum or proverb (<a href="/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>) that "the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge," and maintained with great and passionate earnestness, "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." This may have led the disciples to put the conjectural solution. <span class="accented">Did this man sin?</span> Is there any way or sense in which the man's own sin could be the cause of so great a calamity? It seems entirely gratuitous to derive from this passage any final conclusion as to the method in which they supposed it possible that the man's personality preceded his birth, or any certain conviction that they meant more by their question than this - if sin is the cause of such fearful privation, it must either be the man's parents' or his own. It could not have been his own; was it then his parents'? There was sufficient discussion of the problem among the Jews for one or more vague and unsettled opinions to be floating in their minds. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It cannot be proved that the doctrine of metempsychosis was ever held by the Jews. The language in which Josephus refers to the views of the Pharisees is ambiguous (cf. 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 14; 'Ant.,' 18:01. 3). The view held by them was simply that "the immortal souls of the good (only) pass into another body," are raised into a new life; "but that the souls of the sinful <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, are afflicted with eternal punishment." This differs profoundly from the Oriental, or Pythagorean, or Platonic doctrine of transmigration. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Jewish speculation of the pre-existence of souls has some countenance from Wisd. 8:19, 20, where the pseudo-Solomon says, "I was a witty child, and... being good, I came into a body undefiled," modifying somewhat the Platonic idea of a harmony between the pre-existing soul and the body (see Grimm, 'Exeg.
