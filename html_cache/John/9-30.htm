This phrase highlights the irony and blindness of the religious leaders who, despite their knowledge of the Scriptures, fail to see the divine work in Jesus' actions. The word "remarkable" underscores the extraordinary nature of the miracle, which should have been a clear sign of divine intervention. This reflects the broader theme in John's Gospel of spiritual blindness versus sight, a motif that runs throughout the chapter.<p><b>the man said.</b><br>The man who was healed of blindness is speaking. His testimony is crucial as it comes from a firsthand witness of Jesus' miraculous power. In the cultural context, personal testimony was a powerful form of evidence. The man's boldness in speaking to the Pharisees also indicates a transformation not just physically but spiritually, as he begins to understand and articulate the truth about Jesus.<p><b>&#8220;You do not know where He is from,</b><br>The healed man points out the Pharisees' ignorance regarding Jesus' divine origin. This statement is significant because it contrasts with the earlier claims of the Pharisees who prided themselves on their knowledge of God and the law. The phrase also echoes <a href="/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27</a>, where there is confusion about Jesus' origins. Theologically, it underscores the theme of Jesus being sent from the Father, a key element in John's Gospel.<p><b>and yet He opened my eyes.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the miracle of physical healing as a sign of Jesus' divine authority and power. In the Jewish context, giving sight to the blind was considered a messianic act, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>. The miracle serves as a type of spiritual enlightenment, pointing to Jesus as the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).
