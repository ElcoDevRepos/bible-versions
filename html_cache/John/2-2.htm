The mention of "disciples" implies that Jesus had already begun gathering His followers, which included individuals like Peter, Andrew, James, and John. This gathering of disciples is significant as it marks the formation of a community that would later be instrumental in spreading His teachings. The presence of Jesus and His disciples at a social event like a wedding highlights His engagement with everyday life and His accessibility to the people.<p><b>had also been invited</b><br>The invitation to Jesus and His disciples suggests that they were known to the hosts, possibly indicating a relationship or connection with the family. This reflects the cultural practice of hospitality in Jewish society, where weddings were significant social events often involving the entire community. The fact that Jesus was invited underscores His acceptance and integration into the social fabric of the time, countering any notion that He was a recluse or detached from societal norms.<p><b>to the wedding</b><br>Weddings in Jewish culture were major celebrations, often lasting several days, and were occasions of great joy and community involvement. The setting of a wedding for Jesus' first recorded miracle (turning water into wine) is symbolic, as weddings represent covenant relationships, joy, and new beginnings. This setting foreshadows the new covenant that Jesus would establish through His ministry. Additionally, weddings are often used in Scripture as metaphors for the relationship between God and His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>, where the church is depicted as the bride of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs His first miracle at this wedding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and witnessing His works.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wedding_at_cana.htm">Wedding at Cana</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus performs His first public miracle, turning water into wine, symbolizing the beginning of His public ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_community.htm">The Importance of Community</a></b><br>Jesus' presence at the wedding highlights the value of community and fellowship.

Verse 2 says, &#8220;Jesus &#8230; had also been invited to the wedding.&#8221; Before any miracle takes place, we are reminded who is present.<p>- Earlier John wrote, &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). That same incarnate Word now steps into an everyday village celebration.<p>- His presence affirms that God is not distant from normal life. As Paul later declares, &#8220;Christ, who is your life&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>), joins ordinary people in ordinary events.<p>- By attending, Jesus implicitly endorses marriage as a divine gift (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>) and sets the stage for His first public sign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and</b><p>- The simple conjunction links verse 2 with verse 1, where &#8220;on the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1</a>).<p>- &#8220;And&#8221; reminds us that the Lord&#8217;s actions are never isolated. Just as the Gospel moves seamlessly from His calling of the first followers (<a href="/john/1-35.htm">John 1:35-51</a>) to this wedding, our own lives of faith are meant to flow continually with Him.<p>- Scripture often strings together God&#8217;s works with an &#8220;and&#8221;&#8212;showing His ongoing involvement, e.g., &#8220;God raised Him from the dead AND exalted Him&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32-33</a>). The conjunction quietly testifies that Jesus&#8217; participation in this feast is part of a larger, purposeful sequence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His disciples</b><p>- These early followers&#8212;Andrew, Peter, Philip, Nathanael, and likely John&#8212;have only recently acknowledged Jesus as &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41, 49</a>).<p>- Bringing them along serves several purposes:<p>&#8226; They witness firsthand the nature of their Master&#8212;one who rejoices with those who rejoice (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Their faith is about to be strengthened; after the sign they will believe more deeply (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Community is modeled: &#8220;He appointed twelve so that they might be with Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>).<p>- Discipleship, then and now, is life-on-life. We learn not only from Jesus&#8217; teachings but from His presence in daily settings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had also been invited</b><p>- The verb highlights hospitality. The hosts extended an invitation, and Jesus accepted. Revelation ends with a similar welcome: &#8220;Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<p>- Accepting invitations was typical of Jesus (<a href="/luke/7-36.htm">Luke 7:36</a>; 19:5). He meets people where they are, turning mundane gatherings into moments of revelation.<p>- The inclusion of the disciples shows generosity on the host&#8217;s part and foreshadows the widening circle of the Gospel: many are invited to come (<a href="/matthew/22-2.htm">Matthew 22:2-10</a>).<p>- For believers today, it&#8217;s a call both to invite Christ into every arena of life and to welcome others alongside us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the wedding</b><p>- Weddings celebrate covenant, mirroring God&#8217;s covenant love. Paul writes, &#8220;This mystery is profound, but I am speaking about Christ and the church&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>).<p>- By choosing a wedding for His first sign&#8212;turning water into wine&#8212;Jesus signals the new covenant joy He brings (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>).<p>- John the Baptist will soon call Jesus &#8220;the bridegroom&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>), and the Bible closes with the marriage of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>).<p>- That this event occurs in humble Cana underscores that God&#8217;s redemptive plan unfolds not merely in grand temples but in small-town celebrations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/2-2.htm">John 2:2</a> reveals a Savior who enters everyday life, bringing disciples with Him, accepting hospitality, and honoring marriage. The verse quietly but powerfully teaches that Jesus&#8217; presence sanctifies ordinary moments, invites deeper faith, and anticipates a greater wedding to come where all who trust Him will celebrate forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Was called</span>, or invited, after His arrival in Cana; but we may still think of Him, in whom purpose and result were one, as coming to Cana for the marriage. Nathanael would have known of it, and was perhaps also connected with one of the families.
