In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, honor was a significant social value, often associated with one's status and authority. By stating that all should honor the Son, Jesus is asserting His divine authority and status, which was a radical claim in a monotheistic society. This aligns with <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee shall bow to Jesus, indicating universal recognition of His lordship.<p><b>just as they honor the Father.</b><br>The comparison here underscores the unity and equality between the Father and the Son. In Jewish tradition, God the Father was the ultimate object of worship and reverence. By equating the honor due to the Son with that due to the Father, Jesus is making a profound theological statement about His identity. This is consistent with the prologue of John (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>), which presents Jesus as the Word, who was with God and was God, reinforcing the concept of the Trinity.<p><b>Whoever does not honor the Son</b><br>This phrase serves as a warning and a delineation of true faith. In the context of the Gospel of John, belief in Jesus as the Son of God is central to salvation (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-18</a>). The rejection of the Son is equated with a rejection of the Father, which was a contentious point with the Jewish leaders who claimed to honor God but rejected Jesus. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the necessity of recognizing Jesus' divine role for a proper relationship with God.<p><b>does not honor the Father who sent Him.</b><br>This statement reinforces the mission and authority of Jesus as being directly from the Father. The concept of being "sent" is significant in John's Gospel, emphasizing Jesus' divine origin and purpose (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). It also reflects the prophetic tradition where prophets were sent by God to deliver His message. However, Jesus is more than a prophet; He is the Son, and to reject Him is to reject the Father Himself, as seen in the parable of the tenants (<a href="/mark/12.htm">Mark 12:1-12</a>). This underscores the inseparable relationship between the Father and the Son in the work of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, emphasizing His divine authority and equality with God the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who sent Jesus, highlighting the unity and shared honor between the Father and the Son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the audience in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/john/5.htm">John 5</a>, questioning Jesus' authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus performed miracles and taught in the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_at_bethesda.htm">The Healing at Bethesda</a></b><br>The event preceding this teaching, where Jesus healed a man on the Sabbath, leading to the confrontation with Jewish leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unity_of_the_father_and_the_son.htm">The Unity of the Father and the Son</a></b><br>Understanding the inseparable relationship between the Father and the Son is crucial for a proper theological perspective.

It is surprising that Weiss should declare it "impossible to find any statements here as to the metaphysical unity and equality of the Son and the Father, although current apologetics believe it has succeeded in doing so" ('Life of Christ,' vol. 2:326, note). Luthardt asks, "What other form of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> than that which calls him 'Lord and God' shall belief now assume, than that which the Christian Church cherishes toward Jesus?" Thoma points to <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13</a>, and other great parallels in the New Testament. We gladly accept them, not as proof that the Johannist framed Christ's discourse from them, but as proof that the ideas of St. Paul were not originated by him. but came from the direct assertions of Christ, of which we have the historic trace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">so that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
