His role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus is significant, as he was the one who ultimately authorized Jesus' execution. Pilate's interactions with Jesus are recorded in all four Gospels, highlighting his struggle between political pressure and his own judgment. In this context, Pilate's response is to the Jewish leaders who objected to the inscription he placed on the cross, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews" (<a href="/john/19-19.htm">John 19:19</a>). This phrase reflects Pilate's authority and his decision to stand by his actions despite the protests.<p><b>&#8220;What I have written,</b><br>The inscription on the cross was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, ensuring that it was understood by all who passed by. This trilingual inscription signifies the universal nature of Jesus' kingship, as these were the major languages of the time. Pilate's statement here indicates a finality and a refusal to alter the declaration, which inadvertently affirms the truth of Jesus' identity as King, despite Pilate's likely intention to mock.<p><b>I have written.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the permanence of Pilate's decision. In a broader theological context, it reflects the unchangeable nature of God's plans and purposes. Pilate's words, though spoken in a moment of political maneuvering, align with the divine narrative of Jesus as the prophesied Messiah and King. This echoes the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah's suffering and kingship, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. The statement also serves as a type of Christ's unalterable role as the Savior, whose mission and identity are fixed and eternal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

In Pilate&#8217;s &#8220;What I have written, I have written,&#8221; God secures a public, irreversible testimony that Jesus is King. The stubbornness of a pagan governor becomes the vehicle for fulfilling prophecy, revealing Christ&#8217;s identity to every passer-by, and underscoring that when God&#8217;s word is set down, no human authority can erase or amend it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written</span>. And he curtly dismissed them. Pilate no longer dreaded their making his apparent favor to Jesus into a complaint to the emperor, and he gave way to the indomitable temper of which Philo accuses him.

"I said it, and I meant it; I have crucified your King; yes, true King in his own sense, but not in yours. You have falsely charged him with rebelling against Caesar, and you know that you have lied to my face. Let be; he is your King, and so perish all your futile attempts to shatter the arm that holds you now in its grasp." That and more was condensed in this haughty and obstinate reply. While this was going on in the Praetorium, the tragedy was proceeding at Golgotha; and St. John now returns thither, and describes an event of intense interest which occurred, as all synoptists say, at the very time of the elevation of the cross. John, however, has further facts and symbolic detail to append which were omitted by them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Pilate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#953;&#955;&#8118;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pilatos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4091.htm">Strong's 4091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pilate.
