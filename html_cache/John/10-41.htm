In the context of <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, Jesus had been teaching about being the Good Shepherd, which resonated with many who were familiar with shepherding as a common occupation in ancient Israel. The geographical setting is likely beyond the Jordan, where John the Baptist had previously ministered, a place familiar to those seeking spiritual truth.<p><b>and said,</b><br>The act of speaking to Jesus shows a level of engagement and recognition of His authority. In the cultural context, addressing a rabbi or teacher directly was a sign of respect and acknowledgment of their wisdom. This interaction reflects the Jewish tradition of dialogue and debate as a means of understanding spiritual truths.<p><b>&#8220;Although John never performed a sign,</b><br>John the Baptist's ministry was characterized by preaching repentance and baptizing, rather than performing miracles. This distinction is important because it highlights the different roles within God's plan. John was the forerunner, preparing the way for Jesus, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. His lack of miraculous signs did not diminish his authority or the truth of his message, which was validated by the fulfillment in Jesus.<p><b>everything he said about this man was true.&#8221;</b><br>This affirmation underscores the reliability and prophetic nature of John the Baptist's testimony about Jesus. John had declared Jesus as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), pointing to His role in salvation history. The truthfulness of John's words is confirmed by Jesus' life and ministry, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah.

<a href="/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>).<p>&#8226; This highlights that authentic ministry is rooted in truth, not spectacle.<p>&#8226; The crowds recognize that John&#8217;s authority came from his message, echoing <a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a> where Naaman affirms a prophet&#8217;s word over wonders.<p>&#8226;

John&#8217;s prophetic words about Jesus have proven entirely reliable, and the people respond by coming to Christ themselves. The passage invites every reader to weigh the evidence, trust the faithful witness of Scripture, and come to the Savior whose identity has been confirmed in both word and deed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">And many resorted unto him.</span>--It is one of the key-notes of this Gospel, struck in its opening words (see Note on <a href="/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a>), and recurring at frequent intervals, that in the midst of even the deepest darkness the light is never absent. In contrast with the rejection at Jerusalem there is the reception on the old ground, which brings memories of early days and bright hopes, which are not without their fulfilment now. The mission of the Seventy, and Christ's own work in Galilee before the Feast of the Dedication (comp. Note on <a href="/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.">John 10:22</a>), accounts for the number who now come to Him.<p><span class= "bld">And said, John did no miracle: but all things . . .</span>--Better, as before, <span class= "ital">John did no sign</span> . . . This was not said to Him, but was a general remark suggested by the associations of the spot. The remark assigns to John the position as a witness which he claimed for himself, and which the Evangelist has made prominent in the narrative of His work. He did no sign, and therefore came short of the glory of Him whose signs they had seen and heard of; but more than any other he had recognised that glory, and directed men to it. His spiritual intuition, in advance of the generation in which he lived, was itself a sign, and all things which he had said about the Messiah had, in the events which had taken place since they had seen Him in that place before, been proved to be true. The witness of the past is linked to that of the present. The enthusiasm which John had kindled still burns.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41, 42.</span> - "The posthumous fruit of John's labors" (Bengel). <span class="cmt_word">Many came to him, and they said,</span> one to another, rather than to the Lord, <span class="cmt_word">John indeed did no sign</span>. It was not John's function to work miracles or startle the world with visible proofs of his Divine commission. John stood on the natural sphere, found a place in contemporaneous history, and exerted all his influence by the force of his prophetic word. But as a remarkable confirmation of the whole revelation enacted by the life and deeds of Christ, we read, <span class="cmt_word">But all things that John spake of this Man were true.</span> The testimonies of John were to the effect that Jesus was "mightier" than he - that he was the Son of God, the "Baptizer with the Holy Ghost and with fire," and "<span class="accented">the</span> Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world." The absence of the miraculous nimbus from the record of John's ministry is one of the subsidiary evidences we possess of the supernatural power wielded by our Lord Jesus Christ. John was a historic contemporary of Jesus, whose following survived for some centuries, but not until comparatively recent times did credulity or the mythopceic tendency clothe him in a supernatural glory. He was believed to be the Elijah of the new covenant, but he was not supposed to have gone to heaven, like his prototype. A rumor grew up that Jesus was John raised from the dead, but nothing came of it. There was all the material for a splendid myth, but no evolution of one. The reasoning, therefore, is fair - since Jesus <span class="accented">is</span> reported by <span class="accented">John's disciples</span> to have wrought great signs; these reports are not to be put down to credulity or fiction. The evangelist distinctly asserts that all these testimonies which he had himself recorded in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1</a>, when followed up by the visible and wonderful presence of the Son of God himself, were held to be true. We need not wonder, then, that <span class="cmt_word">many believed on him there.</span> <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Many</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(polloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4183.htm">Strong's 4183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many; often. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;lthon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
