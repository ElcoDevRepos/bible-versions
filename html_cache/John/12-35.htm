It is important to note that this occurs during the final week of Jesus' earthly ministry, shortly before His crucifixion. Jesus often used these moments to impart crucial teachings and prepare His followers for His impending departure.<p><b>For a little while longer, the Light will be among you.</b><br>Here, "the Light" refers to Jesus Himself, as He previously declared in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, "I am the light of the world." The phrase "a little while longer" signifies the limited time remaining before His crucifixion. This is a call to urgency, emphasizing the need to embrace His teachings and presence while He is still physically with them. The concept of light is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, symbolizing God's presence, truth, and guidance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>.<p><b>Walk while you have the Light,</b><br>"Walk" implies living or conducting one's life. Jesus is urging His listeners to live according to His teachings and example while they have the opportunity. This echoes the biblical theme of walking in the light, which is associated with righteousness and fellowship with God, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>.<p><b>so that darkness will not overtake you.</b><br>Darkness symbolizes sin, ignorance, and separation from God. Jesus warns that without His guidance, people are susceptible to being overwhelmed by spiritual darkness. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of light versus darkness, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-14</a>, where believers are called to live as children of light.<p><b>The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</b><br>This statement highlights the confusion and lack of direction inherent in a life apart from Christ. It underscores the spiritual blindness that results from rejecting Jesus, as illustrated in <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>. The imagery of walking in darkness is a powerful metaphor for living without divine truth and guidance, leading to spiritual lostness and peril.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the crowd, offering them guidance and a warning about the urgency of following Him, the Light.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking.

The word connects what follows closely with what has gone before. It was because of their question that Jesus said this. And yet it is not said that "He answered them," because what He said was not a direct answer. They are asking questions in which we may trace the spirit, if not the very words, of the formal, literal objectors who had, with like technicalities, stifled the truth whenever it was springing up in their minds. Such questions cannot be really answered, because they are not really questions. And now the day has gone, and the night is at hand.

It is but a little while, and He warns them with all the solemnity of this thought.<p><span class= "bld">Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you.</span>--The better reading is, <span class= "ital">Walk according as ye have the light</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "Walk as men who are conscious that the light is among them, use your opportunities; do not ask questions to raise objections, but ask them in order that you may know the truth." The man who thus used the light would by no means walk in darkness, but would have the light of life (<a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>). For him that neglected to use the means and faculty he had, both would cease to exist. (Comp. Note on <a href="/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>.)<p>The words "come upon," or "overtake," is used of some sudden seizure. There are two parallels in Biblical Greek, "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness that the day should <span class= "ital">overtake</span> you as a thief" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" title="But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.">1Thessalonians 5:4</a>), and "Be sure your sin will <span class= "ital">find you out"</span> (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm" title="But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.">Numbers 32:23</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - Christ's reply is introduced with a simple <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said to them</span>, not in answer to their question, but by taking up a title of dignity that he had claimed before, he evidently assumes to be the Light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), and now the time is almost over when they could see its luster or discern other things, either themselves, or their sins, or this world, or the next world, by that Light. The time for further instruction, or remonstrance, or declarations is at an end. The evangelist sums up, in vers. 44-50, the general substance of our Lord's teaching with reference to himself and his disciples and the world which would not believe; and thus, then, in a wonderful way, justifies, as it were, the non-answer to the captious question, "Who is this Son of man?" <span class="cmt_word">Yet a little while is the Light amongst you.</span> The "little while" of our Lord's day of ministry was often upon his lips (<a href="/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33</a>; <a href="/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>; <a href="/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>; <a href="/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16</a>). Verily to his consciousness it must have been but as the twinkling of an eye, and now it was a very little while even for his hearers. Based on this solemn fact, he makes a last public appeal to individuals, propounding gracious invitation, Divine promise, solemn warning; and so he terminated his public ministry, and vanished from before them. As far as the memory of his living words and deeds might influence them, the Light, though not among them, might still shine, and the glory of Pentecost would renew the appeal. <span class="cmt_word">Walk as ye have the Light</span>; make progress in the understanding of self, of duty, of time, of eternity, and act accordingly. The <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> is the reading preferred to the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of the T.R. in this and the following verse by Tischendorf, Meyer, Westport and Hort, and the Revisers' text. Meyer here differs from Godet and others who, accepting the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>, give it, in virtue of certain passages in the classics, the sense of <span class="accented">quamdiu</span>, and justly maintains the sense "as," "in the measure that." According to the light that you see, <span class="cmt_word">walk, lest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, "in order that not") <span class="cmt_word">darkness overtake you: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth;</span> lest the possibility of seeing the Divine revelation in <span class="accented">me</span> be taken from you, and lest there be taken away from you that which you seem to have (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>). Then, in harmony with the great sayings of <a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4, 5</a> and John 11:9, "In the night no man can work;" "In the night, when men cannot see the light of this world, they stumble over unseen perils and pitfalls;" so here, he says, in the darkness that will come upon men from making no use of the Light of the world, "they will not know whither they are going," they will find no work, have no perception of imminent danger, but, driven on and on by measureless force, they will drift over the fathomless unknown into infinite and endless suspense. When the Light of the world is spurned, and a godless evolution made to supply its place, humanity and the world have no goal set before them; there is no end at which they aim - no mind or will to guide the progress of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
