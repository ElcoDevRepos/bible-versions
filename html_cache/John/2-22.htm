The resurrection is seen as the ultimate validation of Jesus' divine nature and His victory over sin and death. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which speak of the Messiah's suffering and subsequent exaltation. The resurrection is also a pivotal moment that transformed the disciples' understanding and faith, as it confirmed Jesus' predictions about His death and resurrection (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>, <a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>).<p><b>His disciples remembered that He had said this</b><br>The disciples' remembrance highlights the human tendency to understand spiritual truths more fully in hindsight. Jesus had foretold His death and resurrection multiple times (e.g., <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="/mark/9-31.htm">Mark 9:31</a>), but the disciples did not fully grasp these predictions until after they were fulfilled. This moment of realization underscores the importance of Jesus' teachings and the role of the Holy Spirit in bringing understanding (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p><b>Then they believed the Scripture</b><br>The disciples' belief in the Scripture indicates their recognition of the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. Passages such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, and <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a> are seen as foretelling the suffering, death, and resurrection of Christ. This belief signifies a deeper comprehension of the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus.<p><b>and the word that Jesus had spoken</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and truth of Jesus' words. Throughout His ministry, Jesus spoke with divine authority, often prefacing His teachings with "Truly, truly, I say to you" (e.g., <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). The disciples' belief in His words after the resurrection reflects their acknowledgment of His identity as the Son of God and the reliability of His promises. This belief is foundational for the Christian faith, as it affirms the trustworthiness of Jesus' teachings and His role as the living Word of God (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose resurrection and prior words are the focus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who recalled His words and believed after His resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead, which is pivotal to Christian faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/scripture.htm">Scripture</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophecies and writings that pointed to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, it is the city where Jesus was crucified and resurrected.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_scripture.htm">The Importance of Scripture</a></b><br>The disciples' belief was strengthened by recalling Scripture.

At the time, few grasped that He meant His body, yet the empty tomb proved His words true (<a href="/luke/24-6.htm">Luke 24:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The fact that John places the resurrection first in the verse underscores that everything which follows&#8212;memory, belief, and confidence in Scripture&#8212;is rooted in this historical, bodily event.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His disciples remembered that He had said this</b><p>&#8226; Memory became revelation. After the shock of Calvary and the wonder of Easter morning, the Spirit brought Jesus&#8217; earlier words to mind (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p>&#8226; What had once sounded cryptic (&#8220;Destroy this temple&#8230;&#8221;) suddenly made perfect sense. The disciples connected the dots between Jesus&#8217; metaphor and His physical resurrection (<a href="/john/2-21.htm">John 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments of Spirit-prompted recollection appear in <a href="/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16</a> and <a href="/luke/24-8.htm">Luke 24:8</a>, reminding us that God often clarifies His truth in hindsight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they believed the Scripture</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Scripture&#8221; here points to the Old Testament passages that foretold Messiah&#8217;s sufferings and triumph. <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> (&#8220;You will not abandon my soul to Sheol&#8230;&#8221;) and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-11</a> anticipated both death and victory.<p>&#8226; The disciples moved from mere familiarity with these texts to wholehearted conviction.

The resurrection supplied that clarity.<p>&#8226; From this point on, the apostles preached with unshakeable assurance (<a href="/acts/4-33.htm">Acts 4:33</a>).

It becomes in the mouth of false witnesses the accusation by means of which its meaning is accomplished. The death on the cross is the destruction of the Temple, but it is not unaccompanied by the rent veil; the two meanings are linked together.<p>It fixed itself, too, on the disciples' minds; but weeks, months, years, did not cast any light upon it until the Resurrection. These passages of those familiar Old Testament writings then came to men who had been slow of heart to see them, with the quickening power of a new life. They saw that Christ ought to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory. They saw in Moses and the Prophets the things concerning Him, and they believed in a new and higher sense the written and the spoken word. (Comp. <a href="/luke/24-26.htm" title="Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?">Luke 24:26</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this</span> (to them), <span class="cmt_word">and believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus said.</span> This frequent contrast instituted by the apostle between the first impression produced on the disciples (himself among them) and that which was produced by subsequent reflection after the resurrection of Jesus and gift of the Spirit, becomes a powerful mark of authenticity (compare the passages which Godet has here cited, <a href="/john/4-32.htm">John 4:32, 33</a>; <a href="/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>; <a href="/john/11-12.htm">John 11:12</a>; <a href="/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16, 33</a>; <a href="/john/13-28.htm">John 13:28</a>; with many others). "A pseudo-John imagining, in the second century, this ignorance of the apostle in regard to a saying which he had invented himself, is 'criticism' dashing itself against moral impossibility." These quiet "asides" and reflections of the biographer on the mistaken ideas which he cites and corrects, are of consummate value, as pointing out the stages by which the most stupendous ideas that have taken human spirits captive dawned on the most susceptible minds. The "Word" and the "Scripture" helped the disciples to subsequent faith. Why is "Scripture" in the singular, seeing that John used this form of expression ten times when he had one definite passage of Scripture in his mind, and used the plural when the general authority of Scripture was appealed to? Many have looked to one or another definite Scripture text supposed to predict the resurrection of Christ, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> (some, very wrongly, to <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>, where no reference can be established to this great event). Dr. Moulton points back to <a href="/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, and the impression which the Lord's "zeal" had produced on the disciples. It seems better to recall Christ's own words, and the comment of Luke, in Luke 24:25-27, where the whole Scripture seems to have been laid under contribution to establish the grand expectation. Further, of <a href="/john/20-9.htm">John 20:9</a>, where John, referring to the same subject, uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> in the singular, for the general tendency of Scripture. All the passages which couple suffering and apparent defeat with triumph and victory, did prepare the mind of thoughtful men for the better understanding of the Resurrection. Thus <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. and the closing words of <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>; <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> thereupon come into view; and, in fact, all the Scriptures which anticipate the glorious reign and victory of the Christ and the extension of his kingdom, when coupled with those which portrayed the sorrows of Messiah and of the ideal Sufferer, implicitly convey the same thought. Consequently, numerous passages in Isaiah, Micah, Daniel, Zechariah, Malachi, with <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a> and Psalms 72, 45, etc., taken in connection with prediction of the sorrows of Messiah, did prepare the disciples to believe that the Holy One could not be holden by the pangs of death (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>, etc.). Before closing this paragraph, we must notice that, in this entire transaction, the Lord is not separating himself from the existing theocracy, but interpreting its highest meaning. In the cleansing of the temple at the last he was judging and condemning. The vindication by our Lord of his own action was very different on the latter occasion from what it is here (cf. <a href="/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a> with <a href="/mark/11-17.htm">Mark 11:17</a>), and numerous other accompaniments are profoundly different; nor did he then speak of the destruction of the temple, although, as we have seen, much exaggerated and mis-apprehensive talk concerning him had been floating among the people (<a href="/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
