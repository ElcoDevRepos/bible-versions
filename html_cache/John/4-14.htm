In the context of <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, Jesus is speaking to the Samaritan woman at the well, contrasting the physical water from Jacob's well with the spiritual water He provides. The "water" symbolizes the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>, where Jesus speaks of the Spirit as living water. This offer is universal, extending beyond the Jewish people to include Samaritans and all humanity, reflecting the inclusivity of the Gospel.<p><b>will never thirst.</b><br>This promise of never thirsting again speaks to the complete satisfaction and fulfillment found in a relationship with Christ. In the ancient Near East, water was a precious and often scarce resource, making this metaphor particularly powerful. Spiritually, it signifies the end of the soul's search for meaning and purpose, as echoed in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>, where the psalmist longs for God as a deer pants for water. The assurance of never thirsting again points to the eternal security and contentment found in salvation.<p><b>Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water</b><br>Here, the transformation that occurs within the believer is emphasized. The "fount of water" suggests an internal, self-replenishing source of life and vitality, indicating the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit. This internal change is a hallmark of the New Covenant, prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit. The imagery of a fount also suggests abundance and overflow, indicating that the believer's life will impact others.<p><b>springing up to eternal life.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "springing up" conveys a dynamic, active process, suggesting that the life given by the Spirit is not static but continually growing and renewing. This eternal life is not just a future promise but a present reality, as seen in <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, where Jesus defines eternal life as knowing God and Jesus Christ. The concept of eternal life is central to the Gospel message, fulfilling the prophecies of a restored relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1-3</a>, where the invitation to come and drink is extended to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, offering the "living water" that leads to eternal life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_woman.htm">Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>The recipient of Jesus' message, representing those who are spiritually thirsty and seeking truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob's_well.htm">Jacob's Well</a></b><br>The physical location where this conversation takes place, symbolizing the old covenant and traditions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The region where the event occurs, highlighting the breaking of cultural and religious barriers by Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Though not directly involved in this verse, they are present in the broader account, learning from Jesus' interaction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gift_of_living_water.htm">The Gift of Living Water</a></b><br>Jesus offers a gift that satisfies the deepest spiritual thirst, unlike any earthly solution.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life_through_christ.htm">Eternal Life Through Christ</a></b><br>The living water symbolizes the eternal life that begins now and continues forever, available through faith in Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/breaking_barriers.htm">Breaking Barriers</a></b><br>Jesus' interaction with the Samaritan woman shows that the gospel transcends cultural and social boundaries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_indwelling_spirit.htm">The Indwelling Spirit</a></b><br>The living water is a metaphor for the Holy Spirit, who indwells believers, providing ongoing spiritual renewal and growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/invitation_to_all.htm">Invitation to All</a></b><br>The offer of living water is universal, inviting everyone to partake in the life Jesus offers.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_4_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_4_14_Jesus_as_eternal_satisfaction.htm">How does John 4:14 illustrate Jesus as the source of eternal satisfaction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_never_thirst_signify.htm">What does "never thirst" in John 4:14 imply about spiritual fulfillment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_do_John_4_14_and_Psalm_23_1_relate.htm">How does John 4:14 connect with Psalm 23:1 about lacking nothing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_living_water_daily_2.htm">How can we apply the promise of "living water" in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_quench_spiritual_thirst.htm">What steps can we take to ensure we "never thirst" spiritually?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_does_living_water_mean_in_John_4_14.htm">What does "living water" symbolize in John 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_4_14_s_link_to_eternal_life.htm">How does John 4:14 relate to eternal life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_never_thirst_key_in_John_4_14.htm">Why is the concept of "never thirst" significant in John 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/key_themes_in_john.htm">What are key themes in the Book of John?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'come_to_jesus_moment'_mean.htm">What is the Fountain of the Water of Life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_did_jesus_interact_with_women.htm">How did Jesus interact with women?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/join_us_at_the_waters.htm">Will you come to the waters for refreshment?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 4:14 Mean</div><b>But whoever drinks the water I give him</b><p>- Jesus presents Himself as the exclusive source: &#8220;the water I give.&#8221;

Spiritual hunger is settled because our acceptance before God rests on Christ&#8217;s finished work (<a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>).<p>- Practical outflow: believers still desire growth, yet that longing is anchored in assurance, not emptiness.

It is not an external supply, which must be sought to meet the recurring physical want, but it is the inner never-failing source, the fountain of living water, which satisfies every want as it occurs. He who has it, therefore, can never thirst. Coming from the source of all life, it issues in eternal life. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37-38</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But whosoever shall have drunk of the water which I will give him</span> (of which I am speaking) <span class="cmt_word">shall not</span> (by any means, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thirst again forever.</span> How different from the words of the son of Sirach (Ecclus. 24:21), "They who drink of me," says Wisdom, "shall thirst again"! They will experience neither continuity nor completeness of enjoyment, but periods of incessant and recurrent desire. Jesus speaks of a Divine and complete satisfaction. The spiritual thirst once slaked, the heavenly desire once realized by appropriating the gift of God, is fundamentally satisfied. The nature itself is changed. How closely this corresponds with the idea of birth into a new world! and how nearly akin to the promise of living water in <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>, etc. (see also the language of <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>)! But the water that I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water leaping up (welling, bubbling up and forth) into eternal life. This is the explanation of the full satisfaction of desire. I do not give a simple "drink of water," but I cause a spring, a perennial fountain, a river of Divine pleasure to issue and flow from that inward satisfaction which follows a reception of my gifts; and it is so abundant that it is enough foreverlasting needs. The water that I give becomes a fountain, and the fountain swells into a river, and the river expands into and loses itself in the great ocean of eternity. The beauty of the image is lost if, with Luthardt and Moulton, we attach the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is not elsewhere applied to water, and this use of it gives the metaphor all the more force). The imagery is not without its difficulty. We are tempted to conclude from it that the Divine life, once given, becomes consciously a self-dependent force within the soul; but this would not be justified by all the analogy of the Divine working in humanity, which, though abundant, efficacious, and satisfying, never repudiates its Divine source, but continually proclaims it. If the desire for what God alone can supply is eager and quenchless, and if God meet the craving, then the desire is absolutely satisfied. There is a superfluous fulness in the girt of God which will transcend all the needs of this life, and be enough for eternity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">drinks</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#943;&#8131;</span> <span class="translit">(pi&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4095.htm">Strong's 4095: </a> </span><span class="str2">To drink, imbibe.
