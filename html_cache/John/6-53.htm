The context is a discourse following the feeding of the 5,000, where Jesus is teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. This setting is significant as Capernaum was a central hub for Jesus' ministry in Galilee.<p><b>Truly, truly, I tell you</b><br>The repetition of "truly" (Greek: "amen, amen") emphasizes the importance and certainty of what Jesus is about to say. This phrase is used to underscore the authority of His teaching, a common rabbinic method to highlight a critical truth.<p><b>unless you eat the flesh</b><br>This statement is metaphorical, pointing to the necessity of accepting and internalizing Jesus' sacrifice. In Jewish culture, eating flesh was a vivid metaphor for complete participation. This phrase foreshadows the Last Supper and the institution of the Eucharist, where bread symbolizes Jesus' body.<p><b>and drink the blood</b><br>Drinking blood was strictly forbidden in Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), making this statement particularly shocking. It signifies the new covenant in Jesus' blood, which is essential for eternal life. This anticipates the sacrificial death of Christ and the shedding of His blood for the forgiveness of sins.<p><b>of the Son of Man</b><br>"Son of Man" is a title Jesus frequently used for Himself, emphasizing both His humanity and His messianic role. It connects to <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given authority and an everlasting kingdom, highlighting Jesus' divine authority and mission.<p><b>you have no life in you</b><br>This phrase underscores the spiritual death that exists apart from Christ. It emphasizes the necessity of a personal relationship with Jesus for eternal life. This teaching aligns with <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life, indicating that true life is found only through Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the necessity of spiritual sustenance through Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Present during this teaching, they are challenged to understand the deeper spiritual meaning of Jesus' words.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Includes both followers and skeptics, who are grappling with the radical nature of Jesus' teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The location where Jesus delivers this discourse, a town on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper (Event)</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned here, this teaching foreshadows the institution of the Lord's Supper.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_nourishment.htm">Understanding Spiritual Nourishment</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that true life comes from Him.

Others may even have pressed this to the <span class= "ital">reductio ad horribile.</span> Eat His flesh! Shall we, then, drink His blood too? In no less than seven passages of the Pentateuch had the eating of blood been forbidden (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm" title="But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not eat.">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm" title="It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that you eat neither fat nor blood.">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/7-26.htm" title="Moreover you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.">Leviticus 7:26-27</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-26.htm" title="You shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall you use enchantment, nor observe times.">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-16.htm" title="Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth as water.">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-23.htm" title="Only be sure that you eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and you may not eat the life with the flesh.">Deuteronomy 12:23-24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-23.htm" title="Only you shall not eat the blood thereof; you shall pour it on the ground as water.">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>); and we find in later times the strength of the feeling of abhorrence, as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-32.htm" title="And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.">1Samuel 14:32</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/33-25.htm" title="Why say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall you possess the land?">Ezekiel 33:25</a>, and in the decree of the first Judaeo-Christian Council (<a href="/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.">Acts 15:29</a>). In the fullest of these passages (<a href="/context/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), the prohibition is grounded upon the facts that the blood is the physical seat of animal life, and that the blood maketh atonement for the soul. It was the life-element poured out before God instead of the life of the soul that sinned. Such would be the thoughts of those who strove among themselves as to what His words could mean; and to these thoughts He speaks with the "Verily, verily," which ever expresses a spiritual truth that He alone could reveal. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 53, 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said to them,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and have drunk his blood, ye have not life in yourselves</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He that eateth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "eateth with pleasure, eagerness," is repeated four times, as perhaps a stronger expression than <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> This result, it should be seen, is <span class="accented">identical with the promises made to</span> "<span class="accented">beholding</span>," "<span class="accented">coming</span>," "<span class="accented">believing</span>." Life and resurrection will really follow these acts and conditions; but then it is obvious that "beholding," "coming," "believing," must veritably cover what is contained in this last statement. There is no mere tautology. These words express more fully the original condition. They are not new conditions, but a further imaginative exposition of the former ones. The believing involves an assimilation into the very substance of the believer's nature of that which he here specifies as "flesh and blood." Reuss and Luthardt, and to some extent Moulton, admit that by "flesh and blood" he means no more than "flesh;" that under "flesh" is included "blood;" that by both he simply means "himself." Lunge urges that by "flesh" is meant "human nature" - his "manhood;" but by "flesh and blood" (see <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>), "inherited nature" - the humanity of Christ in "<span class="accented">historical manifestation</span>." But he passes on to say that this manifestation culminates, is completed, in death, and, thus completed, the life of Christ is the nourishment of the real life of man. Tholuck: "The addition of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f78;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> only expresses, by its main constituents, the sensible human nature." The great bulk of interpreters take the additional mention of drinking of his blood to connote an entire acceptance of the atoning sacrifice, of the Paschal blood shedding, to be effected for the deliverance of the world (so Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Grotius, Lucke, Neander, Keim, Meyer, Weiss, etc.). "Eating of the flesh," then, would mean acceptance of his humanity, of the manifestation of the eternal love in the Son of man; and "drinking his blood" would mean entire mental assimilation also of the terrible culmination of his mission in violent, sacrificial death. This momentous condition of life eternal is stated both negatively and positively. Without the participation in this twofold aspect of the Lord and his work, there is no <span class="accented">life</span>. Unless "coming to him," "believing on him," means an acceptance of his humanity, an apprehension of that Personality in whom the Word was incarnate, and an utter surrender of the soul to the rending of that flesh and shedding of the blood which is the life, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the death of the Son of man, it is not the coming to him and believing on him of which he has already spoken. He that does thus eat and drink will satisfy a craving after nourishment and refreshment. Unless a man consciously or unconsciously accepts, absorbs, the sublime and wondrous gift of the Divine humanity from the second Man, the Lord from heaven, rather than from the first man, he has no life in himself. Human nature apart item the new creation and the new beginning is a dying, not a living, entity. The new life quickened by the Incarnation is not all that Christ would give. The blood of the Son of man, to be accepted in the same way. is a further exposition of the object of faith. The "eating" and "drinking" are therefore phrases which portray the very intimate and close form of that contact with, and dependence upon, the incarnation and the sacrifice of the Son of God, which Christ erewhile defines in broader, vaguer metaphor. A great question has arisen on these verses - whether our Lord is pointing to, or making prophetic reference to, the institution of the Eucharist, about which the fourth evangelist is strangely silent. Certain of the early Fathers - Chrysostom, Cyril, and Theophylact - have given it this meaning, though the great bulk of the patristic writers - Ignatius, Irenseus, Origen, Clemens Alex., Tertullian, and even Cyprian (though the passage may be applied by them to the Eucharist as <span class="accented">one</span> way or method of spiritually eating and drinking the Son of man) - do most obviously interpret the passage itself of direct and spiritual, not the indirect and sacramental manducation of the living Bread. The same view is presented by Eusebius, Athanasius, and Cyril of Alexandria. For the first four centuries all that was done was to apply the argument of ch. 6, in order to press the importance of communicating sacramentally. This led the Romanist writers to go further, and regard the participation in the sacramental body and blood as essential to life eternal. Pope Innocent I., Bishop of Rome, A.D. 402, was the first distinguished man who brought up out of this passage "the necessity of communicating infants;" and from the time of his synodical epistle (A.D. 417) the Latin Chinches interpreted the passage, "Except you receive the Eucharist, you have no life in you." The views of Augustine were vacillating or are dubious. Fulgentius shows that he had, to some extent, broken loose from this narrow view when he concluded that baptism without the Eucharist did convey all the benefits of the body and blood of Christ. Numerous Schoolmen (see Albertinus, 'De Eucharistia,' lib. <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. 30; and Wake, 'Disc. of the Eucharist,' p. 20) rejected the sacramental interpretation, and the Reformers most justly repudiated it. Luther, Melancthon, Beza, Grotius, Owen, Lampe, Cocceius, asserted that the whole construction of the passage, which treats "coming," "believing," as the complete conditions of life and resurrection, must not be held to transform an, as yet, uninstituted ceremonial into the sole method of "believing." Notwithstanding this wide protest, the opponents of the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel - Bretschneider, Strauss, Baur, Thoma, Hilgenfeld, and numerous others - see in this passage the conception of a mystically disposed second-century divine, who placed the Eucharistic ceremony in the lips of Jesus long before the institution. But while this view can be without hesitation rejected, it is obvious that there was a spiritual participation in the "humanity" and the "sacrifice" of the Son of God which Christ called upon the Capernaites to experience - one which must have been possible to Old Testament saints, to little children; to all who are acceptable to God and accepted by him. Such participation is, without doubt, aided and rendered peculiarly possible, thinkable, in the Eucharist. These words were timed, therefore, to bear the rich and twofold sense of Holy Scripture. Observe: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>, in every account of the institution of the Supper, is not without special meaning; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> meaning the whole of his humanity, and the entire fulness of the sacrifice for the world; while <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> suggest that organized personal life in which the Incarnation culminated, and the blood which was shed for the remission of sins. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is not without reference to the new "body" in which the spirit would be ultimately enshrined. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The phrase, "drinking of the blood," is peculiar to these verses. In the Eucharist we "drink of the cup which is the new covenant in the blood of Christ." "The hand of history," says Edersheim, "has drawn out the telescope; and, as we gaze through it, every sentence and word sheds light upon the cross, and light from the cross carrying to us the twofold meaning - his death and its celebration in the great Christian sacrament." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-53.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
