The disciples were a group of men who followed Jesus closely, learning from His teachings and witnessing His miracles. Being a disciple meant having a unique and intimate relationship with Jesus, which makes Judas's later actions more significant and tragic. The role of a disciple was to learn and eventually spread the teachings of their master, which highlights the gravity of Judas's betrayal.<p><b>Judas Iscariot</b><br>Judas Iscariot is often remembered as the disciple who betrayed Jesus. His surname, "Iscariot," likely indicates his place of origin, possibly Kerioth in Judea, distinguishing him from the other Judas among the disciples. Judas's role in the narrative of the Gospels is pivotal, as his actions lead to the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus. His character is often examined in theological discussions about free will, sin, and redemption.<p><b>who was going to betray Him</b><br>This phrase foreshadows the impending betrayal of Jesus by Judas. The betrayal is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend lifting his heel against the psalmist. Judas's betrayal is a critical event in the Passion narrative, leading to Jesus's arrest and crucifixion. It raises questions about predestination and human responsibility, as Judas's actions were foreknown by Jesus, yet he acted of his own volition.<p><b>asked</b><br>The act of asking here introduces Judas's question, which is recorded in the following verses. This moment is significant because it reveals Judas's character and motivations. His question is not just a simple inquiry but is loaded with ulterior motives, as seen in the context of the surrounding verses. Judas's questioning attitude contrasts with the faith and devotion expected of a disciple, highlighting his internal conflict and eventual betrayal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, known for betraying Jesus to the religious authorities for thirty pieces of silver.

Matthew refers the speech to the disciples generally, in whom the suggestion of Judas had stirred up (without guile or blame on their part) a not unnatural inquiry. Mark says "some" murmured to themselves, "Why this waste?" (loss, destruction). John (without the malice which Renan has attributed to the writer) mentions the source of the suggestion, "Judas Iscariot, Simon's son." The word <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, contained in T.R., is omitted here in the best texts. The fact that he was the traitor, being one of the well-known and awful events of the gospel history when John wrote some half a century later, might well be introduced by the evangelist, with no other than a purely historical motive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7991;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
