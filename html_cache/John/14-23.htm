In the context of <a href="/john/14.htm">John 14</a>, Jesus is speaking to His disciples during the Last Supper, providing them with comfort and instruction before His impending crucifixion. This setting is intimate and significant, as Jesus is preparing His followers for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>If anyone loves Me</b><br>Love for Jesus is a central theme in the New Testament, emphasizing a personal and relational aspect of faith. This love is not merely emotional but is demonstrated through actions and obedience. The concept of loving God is rooted in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which calls for loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>he will keep My word</b><br>Obedience to Jesus' teachings is a natural outflow of genuine love for Him. This phrase underscores the importance of adhering to the teachings of Christ as a demonstration of faith. It echoes the covenantal language found throughout the Old Testament, where obedience to God's commands is a sign of loyalty and devotion (e.g., <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>).<p><b>My Father will love him</b><br>This statement highlights the reciprocal nature of the relationship between God and believers. The love of the Father is assured to those who love and obey Jesus. It reflects the unity and shared purpose between the Father and the Son, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, where Jesus declares, "I and the Father are one."<p><b>and We will come to him</b><br>The use of "We" signifies the presence of both the Father and the Son with the believer. This promise of divine presence is a profound assurance of God's nearness and involvement in the life of a believer. It anticipates the coming of the Holy Spirit, who will dwell within believers, as further explained in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>.<p><b>and make Our home with him</b><br>The imagery of making a home suggests a permanent and intimate relationship. This echoes the Old Testament concept of God dwelling among His people, as seen in the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). In the New Testament, this indwelling presence is fulfilled through the Holy Spirit, making each believer a temple of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). This promise assures believers of God's continual presence and fellowship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples, providing them with comfort and instruction about the relationship between love, obedience, and divine presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father is mentioned as the one who will love those who love and obey Jesus, highlighting the unity and shared mission between the Father and the Son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are called to love and obey Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/john/14.htm">John 14</a> includes the promise of the Holy Spirit, who plays a role in helping believers keep Jesus' word.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_home.htm">The Home</a></b><br>The concept of God making His home with believers signifies an intimate and ongoing relationship between God and those who love and obey Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/love_and_obedience.htm">Love and Obedience</a></b><br>True love for Jesus is demonstrated through obedience to His word.

This is not abstract theory but a direct, personal response from Jesus, much like earlier moments in <a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9-10</a> where He gently corrects misunderstandings.<p>- Every word carries the authority of the One who, according to <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, made all things; therefore, we read with confidence that His reply is final and sufficient.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If anyone loves Me</b><p>- Love for Jesus is not limited to the apostles; &#8220;anyone&#8221; opens the door to every believer, echoing <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>.<p>- True love is more than sentiment. First <a href="/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a> reminds us that we love because He first loved us, setting the foundation for genuine devotion.<p>- Notice the personal focus: &#8220;Me.&#8221; Our first loyalty is to Christ Himself, aligning with <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a> where Jesus demands pre-eminence over all other relationships.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will keep My word</b><p>- Love expresses itself in obedience. Jesus already said, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Here He repeats the thought for emphasis.<p>- Obedience is practical:<p>&#8226; It means treasuring His teaching (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>).<p>&#8226; It means doing what He says (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>- This is not legalism; it is relational loyalty, paralleling <a href="/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a> where abiding in His love and keeping His commands are inseparable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My Father will love him</b><p>- The Father&#8217;s love is active and relational, just as <a href="/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a> celebrates: &#8220;See what great love the Father has given us.&#8221;<p>- While God already loved the world (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>), this verse highlights a special, intimate enjoyment of His love reserved for obedient believers&#8212;similar to <a href="/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>, &#8220;He blesses the righteous.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We will come to him</b><p>- &#8220;We&#8221; points to the unity of Father and Son (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>).

Loving Jesus leads naturally to keeping His word; obedient believers experience the Father&#8217;s special love; and Father and Son, through the Spirit, take up permanent residence in the believer&#8217;s life. This living relationship is the heart of Christian discipleship and the daily assurance that we are never alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">If a man love me, he will keep my words.</span>--Our Lord repeats the condition necessary on the part of man in order that the manifestation of God to him may be possible.

Note on <a href="/john/14-2.htm" title="In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.">John 14:2</a>. The thought of God as dwelling in the sanctuary and among the people was familiar to the disciples from the Old Testament Scriptures (see, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm" title="And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-45.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.">Exodus 29:45</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/26-11.htm" title="And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-26.htm" title="Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the middle of them for ever more.">Ezekiel 37:26</a>), and the thought of the spiritual temple in the heart of man was not unknown to contemporary writers. Philo has a remarkable parallel in his treatise, <span class= "ital">De Cherubim,</span> p. 124, "Since therefore He (God) thus invisibly enters into the region of the soul, let us prepare that place, in the best way the case admits of, to be an abode worthy of God; for if we do not, He, without our being aware of it, will quit us and migrate to some other habitation which shall appear to Him to be more excellently provided" (Bohn's ed., vol. i., p. 199. See the whole of chap. 29). Sch&#8221;ttgen, in his note, quotes from a Rabbinical writer who says, "Blessed is the man who strives daily to make himself approved unto God, and prepares himself to receive the divine guest." (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>; and <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said to him, If a man,</span> let him be whosoever he may, love me - there is the germ and root of all - he will keep my Word (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). In Ver. 21 we see the complementary statement, "He that has and keeps my commandments loves me;" here, "He that loves me keeps my Word." In Ver. 21 obedience proves inward love, and may indicate to the world the fact of the Father's love and my own response. Here our Lord is laying down the principle of relation - the law of close intimacy, the conditions of higher knowledge. The keeping of the Word is a certain consequence of holy love. <span class="cmt_word">And my Father will love him.</span> So far Christ has only reiterated the great statement of Ver. 21, but instead of saying, "I will love him, and manifest myself," he added, <span class="cmt_word">We will come</span> - the Father and I - <span class="cmt_word">to him, and take up our abode</span>, make for ourselves a resting-place <span class="cmt_word">in his dwelling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>); cf. the analogous and wonderful parallel in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>. There is a clear utterance of Divine self-consciousness. It is worthy of note that such an expression as this sounds a profounder depth of that consciousness than any phrase (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) already delivered. Apart from the stupendous corroborative facts elsewhere on record, this seems, to mere human experience, either awfully true or infinitely blasphemous. <span class="accented">The Father add</span> g will come together in the power of the Spirit, and we will dwell within the loving and obedient soul.
