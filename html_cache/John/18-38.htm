In the Greco-Roman world, truth was often seen as relative, with various philosophical schools offering differing perspectives. Pilate's question may indicate his dismissal of the idea that there is a single, knowable truth, contrasting with Jesus' earlier declaration in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." This moment highlights the tension between worldly power and divine truth, as Pilate, a Roman governor, represents earthly authority, while Jesus embodies divine truth.<p><b>And having said this, he went out again to the Jews</b><br>Pilate's action of going out to the Jews signifies the political and social dynamics at play. The Jewish leaders had brought Jesus to Pilate, seeking a Roman execution because they lacked the authority to carry out capital punishment under Roman rule. Pilate's movement between Jesus and the Jewish leaders underscores his role as a mediator in this tense situation. The Jewish leaders were outside the praetorium to avoid ceremonial defilement before the Passover, which is why Pilate had to go out to them, highlighting the cultural and religious customs of the time.<p><b>and told them, &#8220;I find no basis for a charge against Him.&#8221;</b><br>Pilate's declaration of Jesus' innocence is significant, as it fulfills the prophetic imagery of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, who was without deceit or wrongdoing. Despite the accusations from the Jewish leaders, Pilate, representing Roman law, finds no legal grounds for Jesus' execution. This statement is crucial in the narrative, as it emphasizes Jesus' sinlessness and the injustice of His trial and crucifixion. It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice Jesus would make, as the Lamb of God, without blemish or defect, as described in <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

The passage calls every reader to move beyond curiosity to confession, embracing the One who is Truth Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?</span>--"'What is truth?' said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer." Such is Lord Bacon's well-known interpretation of Pilate's well-known question. Others have seen in it the bitterness of a mind that had been tossed to and fro in the troubled sea of contemporaneous thought, and despaired of an anchorage. Others, again; have traced the tone of sarcasm in the governor's words--"Is the son of Roman freedom and Greek thought, which had at this time been welded into one power, to learn truth of a Jewish enthusiast?" while the older interpreters, for the most part, regarded the question as that of an earnest inquirer desiring to be satisfied. These are a few among the many thoughts the passage has suggested; and yet none of them seem to give the natural impression which follows from the words. Bacon's is nearest to it, but Pilate was far from jesting. He seems rather to have been irritated by the refusal of the Jews to furnish a formal accusation (<a href="/john/18-31.htm" title="Then said Pilate to them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:">John 18:31</a>), and more so at the question of Jesus in <a href="/john/18-34.htm" title="Jesus answered him, Say you this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me?">John 18:34</a>, and the subtleties, as he thinks them, of <a href="/john/18-36.htm" title="Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.">John 18:36</a>. This seems to him to be another, and at all events it is wholly irrelevant to the question at issue. He has neither time nor will to deal with it, and at once goes from the palace again to the Jews.<p><span class= "bld">I find in him no fault at all.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I find</span> <span class= "ital">no crime in Him.</span> St. John uses the word rendered "fault" only in this phrase. (Comp. <a href="/john/19-4.htm" title="Pilate therefore went forth again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.">John 19:4</a>; <a href="/john/19-6.htm" title="When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, Take you him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.">John 19:6</a>.) It is used by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/27-37.htm" title="And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Matthew 27:37</a>) for the technical "accusation written, This is Jesus, the King of the Jews," and this seems to be the sense here. "I find no ground for the legal charge (<a href="/john/18-33.htm" title="Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?">John 18:33</a>). Whatever He may be, there is no proof of treason against the majesty of Caesar." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth</span>? The aphorism of Lord Bacon, "'What is truth?' said jesting Pilate, and did not wait for an answer," scarcely represents the reality oft-he case. Pilate was not scornfully jesting with a metaphysical problem, nor professing himself hopelessly baffled in search for it. The language was not the utterance of irrepressible homage to his mysterious Prisoner, or heartfelt sympathy with him. For on this supposition why did he not wait for some more words of strange unearthly wisdom? Nor does he go so far in his skepticism as Pliny the Eider did when he said, "that there is only one thing certain, viz. that there is nothing certain;" but as a man of the world having to do with Roman authority or intrigue and Jewish fanaticism, Pilate despised earnestness and zeal, and was utterly unable to believe in the existence of a world or region where any higher reality than force prevailed. But the governor was now, with his narrow range of thought, strongly convinced that Jesus was utterly innocent of the charge brought against him. The unanswered question is equivalent to this - What has truth to do with kingship? What has the vague shadowy region over which this poor king reigns to do with plots against Caesar? He saw enough to induce him to break off the interview within the Praetorium, and he proceeded, though vainly, to deliver a verdict on the case. <span class="cmt_word">When he had said this, he went out to the Jews, and said, I find no crime in him.</span> Here, however, must be introduced the scenes described by Matthew, Mark, and especially by Luke - scenes of loud and angry dispute and renewed and fierce accusation (<a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>; <a href="/mark/15-3.htm">Mark 15:3-5</a>; <a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4-12</a>). In all three accounts, after the admission that he was King of the Jews, the loud, fierce accusations followed in which our Lord, notwithstanding the repeated summons of Pilate, "answered nothing." At this the governor marveled greatly (Matthew and Mark). It is not impossible that the first question which Pilate put to him <span class="accented">within</span> the Praetorium was renewed and laconically answered with the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, as before I but all the wild roar of the chief priests and people could extract nothing more. This silence in face of the accusation of the mob astonished Pilate, and made him more than ever convinced of the innocence of his Prisoner. B. Weiss shows conclusively how much light this interview with Pilate throws on the synoptic narrative; that, in fact, Pilate's whole conduct is only explicable on the supposition that he had received cogent reasons to disarm all political mistrust (see 'Life of Jesus,' vol. 3. pp. 348, 349). Westcott says, "It is of great interest to compare this confession before Pilate with the corresponding confession before the high priest (<a href="/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>). The one addressed to the Jews is in the language of prophecy, the other addressed to a Roman appeals to the verdict of universal conscience. The one speaks of a future manifestation of <span class="accented">glory</span>, the other of a present manifestation of <span class="accented">truth</span>." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
