The act of drawing out the liquid signifies the transition from the ordinary to the extraordinary, symbolizing the transformative power of Jesus. In biblical symbolism, water often represents purification, while wine can symbolize joy and abundance. This miracle foreshadows the new covenant, where Jesus transforms the old (water) into the new (wine).<p><b>He said,</b><br>Jesus' command here is authoritative, reflecting His divine authority. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus' words often precede miraculous events, demonstrating His power over nature and His role as the divine Word (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>). His instructions are simple yet profound, requiring faith and obedience from those who hear.<p><b>and take it to the master of the banquet.</b><br>The master of the banquet, or the head steward, was responsible for overseeing the feast and ensuring everything was in order. Presenting the wine to him first was a customary practice, ensuring the quality of the wine before serving it to the guests. This act highlights the social customs of first-century Jewish weddings, where hospitality and the quality of the feast were of utmost importance. The miracle's revelation to the master of the banquet signifies the unveiling of Jesus' glory to those in positions of authority and responsibility.<p><b>They did so,</b><br>The servants' obedience is crucial in this narrative. Their compliance without question or hesitation reflects a theme of faith and trust in Jesus' instructions. This obedience is a recurring theme in Scripture, where faith often precedes understanding. The servants' actions also serve as a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of following Jesus' commands even when the outcome is not immediately clear.<div class="vheading2">Persons /

the brim&#8221; at Jesus&#8217; direction (<a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7</a>). Now He asks them to dip into what still looks like ordinary water. Like Joshua&#8217;s priests stepping into the Jordan before it parted (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a>) or Peter casting his net after an empty night (<a href="/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4-6</a>), this is faith expressed before the miracle is visible.<p>&#8226; Jesus involves humble servants, not the bridegroom, reminding us that God delights to use the lowly (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The instruction is simple and doable; obedience is the only requirement. As in <a href="/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2-6</a>, where common jars become vessels of God&#8217;s provision, everyday tasks become channels for divine power when done at His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;He said&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-8.htm">John 2:8</a>)<p>&#8226; The miracle hinges on the authority of Christ&#8217;s spoken word. Throughout this Gospel, what Jesus says happens: &#8220;Go&#8230;your son lives&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-50.htm">John 4:50</a>); &#8220;Lazarus, come out!&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>).<p>&#8226; His commands carry the same weight as at creation&#8212;&#8220;He spoke, and it came to be&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Trust grows when we take Him at His word, even when circumstances offer no natural proof (<a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and take it to the master of the banquet</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and take it to the master of the banquet.&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-8.htm">John 2:8</a>)<p>&#8226; The &#8220;master&#8221; is the official taster responsible for quality.

Jesus gives a clear, practical instruction; the servants act in faith; the quality of the miracle is verified openly. The verse invites believers today to trust His word, obey promptly, and expect that what He transforms privately will stand up to public scrutiny and bring glory to God (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.</span>--A vessel was let down into the pitcher, and was then carried to the ruler of the feast, who would distribute the wine in it to the guests. <span class= "ital">Ruler</span> rather than "governor." The same English word should be used throughout the two verses. What exact office is denoted by the Greek word is uncertain, as it occurs nowhere else in the Bible, and is very rare in the classical authors. The chief English commentators (Alford, Wordsworth, Trench) are agreed that he was chosen by the guests from among their own number, but this opinion has not commanded the general assent of scholars; and there seems more reason to think that the person intended is what we should call the "head-waiter," whose duty it was to taste the viands and wines, to arrange the tables and couches, and to be generally responsible for the feast.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draw forth</span> (the object of the verb is not in the sentence. He did not say the "water" which you placed there, nor the "wine" into which it has been transformed, but simply, "Draw forth"), <span class="cmt_word">and bear to the governor of the feast.</span> The traditional interpretation, that the water jars were the source of the unwonted supply, and the measure of it, strongly commends itself in preference to the suggestions of Westcott, Moulton, as well as Barnes, Olshausen, and others. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the "master of the table," is the chief servant presiding over the arrangements of the feast. This was an Attic official, referred to by Athenaeus (4, 100, 70) as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. Heliodor., 7:27). The "symposiarch," <span class="accented">arbiter bibendi</span>, is not to be confounded with him. The latter was one of the guests chosen to taste the wine, etc. (see Ecclus. 32:1, where he is called <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The "governor" is one who occupies a still higher position of importance in Greek feasts. There is no other trace of the Attic usage among the Jews. As the passage in Ecclesiasticus indicates a different custom, and the references to something similar describe the officer by different names, no very sure conclusion can be drawn. Wunsche says that, ordinarily, the master of the house was bound to serve his guests, and preside over the distribution of food and presents. Thus, at the marriage of his son, Rabbi Gamaliel served all his invited guests. Trench, Alford, and Wordsworth think that the governor here was one of the invited guests, from the freedom with which he addressed the bridegroom. Meyer, Godet, take the view that he was not. <span class="cmt_word">And they bear</span> <span class="cmt_word">it</span>, conscious of a wondrous fact, which must have filled them with consternation. At first the order must have seemed like folly, as when Moses called on Israel to "go forward" into the Red Sea, or as when Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take up thy bed, and walk." "They bear it." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(nyn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3568.htm">Strong's 3568: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle of present time; 'now'; also as noun or adjective present or immediate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">draw [some] out,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#957;&#964;&#955;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Antl&#275;sate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_501.htm">Strong's 501: </a> </span><span class="str2">To draw (generally water from a deep well in the ground); perhaps: I draw out.
