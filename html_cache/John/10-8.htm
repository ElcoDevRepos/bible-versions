In the historical context, various individuals arose in Israel claiming to be the deliverer or leader, often leading people astray. This can be seen in the context of false prophets and leaders mentioned in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>, where God condemns the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of His pasture. Jesus positions Himself as the true shepherd, contrasting with those who came before Him.<p><b>were thieves and robbers</b><br>The terms "thieves" and "robbers" suggest deceit and violence. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, thieves would sneak in to steal, while robbers would use force. This imagery is used to describe false leaders who exploit and harm the people for personal gain. <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a> also speaks against the shepherds of Israel who fed themselves rather than the flock, highlighting the selfishness and destructiveness of these false leaders. Jesus, in contrast, offers protection and genuine care for His followers.<p><b>but the sheep did not listen to them</b><br>This indicates that true believers, represented as sheep, were not ultimately deceived by these false leaders. In biblical symbolism, sheep are often used to represent God's people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>. The idea that the sheep did not listen suggests a divine protection and discernment given to those who are truly God's.

While thieves and robbers exploit, the sheep, awakened by God&#8217;s call, refuse their voices and remain receptive only to Christ. The verse reassures believers that, throughout history, God preserves His flock, guiding them away from deception and toward the abundant life found solely in the Good Shepherd.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1</a>. The Sinaitic MS. and several of the early versions read this verse without the words translated "before Me," but the balance of authority is strongly in their favour; and the fact of their being hard to understand, or having been misunderstood, is the probable reason of their omission. Retaining them, as we seem bound to do, we are also bound to give them their ordinary temporal meaning. There can be but one rendering which suggests itself to the unbiassed mind, and that is the rendering of our version. The Greek words and the English words are equally plain, and other renderings are due to the exigencies of interpretation.<p>What, then, do the words mean? Their force seems to be all-inclusive; and yet they cannot contradict Christ's own words, which have excluded Abraham, Moses, the prophets, John the Baptist, from any possibility of such thoughts. (See <a href="/john/4-22.htm" title="You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.">John 4:22</a>; <a href="/john/5-33.htm" title="You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.">John 5:33</a>; <a href="/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>; <a href="/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>; <a href="/john/7-19.htm" title="Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why go you about to kill me?">John 7:19</a>.) They cannot, on the other hand, be limited to false Christs, who did not come before but after our Lord. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/5-43.htm" title="I am come in my Father's name, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.">John 5:43</a>.) Here, as often, the true meaning seems for the most part to have been overlooked because men have sought it elsewhere than in the words themselves, and in their place among other words. The thought which precedes and which follows is that Jesus is Himself "the door." "All that ever came before Me" is in immediate contrast to this thought, and the sense is, "all professing to be themselves the door, to be the means by which men enter the fold, to be the Mediator between man and God." The Old Testament teachers cannot be meant, because they witnessed to the true door. But there had been growing up since the return from the Captivity, and the close of the Old Testament canon, a priestly caste in the place of the prophetic schools, and these men had been in practice, if not in word, claiming for themselves the position of door to the kingdom of God. There were Hillels and Shammais, heads of parties and of factions, whose word was to their followers as the word of God; there were Pharisees then standing round Him who had solemnly decreed that any one who should confess Him to be the Messiah should be shut out from Temple and from synagogue, and that they themselves would in God's name pronounce a curse upon his head (<a href="/john/9-22.htm" title="These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.">John 9:22</a>). As "thieves" were they, and as "robbers;" wolves in sheep's clothing, stealing into the flock of Christ and rending those who were the true sheep. (Comp. the analogous language of <a href="/luke/11-52.htm" title="Woe to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in you hindered.">Luke 11:52</a>.) The lawyers closed the door and plundered and oppressed those whom they kept outside. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that came before me</span> <span class="cmt_word">are thieves and robbers</span>. Great difficulty has been felt by commentators in understanding "before me." The words clearly gave the early Gnostic heretics a text on which they established their dualistic rejection of the old dispensation. Their absence from certain texts led Augustine and others to emphasize the word "came." "All who <span class="accented">came</span>," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in their own strength or wisdom, when not "<span class="accented">sent"</span> or authorized by God. Other endeavors have been made (see Meyer and Lunge) to give it a non-temporal meaning, such as <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, "independently of <span class="accented">me</span>." Wolf and Olshausen make <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>, "<span class="accented">in</span> the place" or "in the stead of me" (so Lunge, Lampe, Schleusner). De Wette and others accept the temporal meaning, "before," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in point of time, and include under it the entire <span class="accented">corpus</span> of Old Testament saints and teachers, and therefore regard the saying as inconsistent with the gentleness of Christ. But with <a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39, 45-47</a>, and many other passages in this Gospel, it is certain the words could not mean to denounce all who came as teachers or shepherds before him in mere <span class="accented">point of time</span> as "thieves and robbers," whom the sheep did not hear. Therefore the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> must be to some extent modified in meaning. We agree with Westcott and Godet in limiting <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span>, by throwing the emphasis on the "came," and by adding, moreover, to it the essential point, "came making themselves doors of the sheep" - claiming to have the "key of knowledge," professing vainly to open or shut the door of heaven. That is, no other has ever had the right or claim to be such "a door." The Baptist, the prophets, one by one, Abraham and Moses, in their day made no such profession. The dignity belongs to Christ alone. The language may receive accentuation from the pressing urgency of false Christs, as well as the hopeless system of Pharisaic pride. Theme sees here the mere dressing out of St. Paul's language, condemnatory of false prophets and ravening wolves who would not spare the flock of Christ (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>), and Christ's own words in the synoptists (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>, etc.). Special reference is made to the ceremonial superstitions, to "the hedge about the Law," to the cruel slavery of modern Pharisaism, which had done what neither prophets nor priests of old had attempted. Archdeacon Watkins emphasizes the present tense, "<span class="accented">are</span> thieves," etc., making Christ's reference obvious to the lawyers and scribes of his own day, who were closing the door, and plundering those whom they kept out of the kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">But the sheep did not hear them</span>. The true sheep have not been seduced by them. The teaching of these Pharisees has not prevailed over susceptible souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
