His response here reflects a focus on the logistical and material aspects of the situation. This moment occurs during the feeding of the 5,000, a miracle that is recorded in all four Gospels, highlighting its significance. Philip's role in this narrative underscores the human tendency to rely on visible resources rather than divine provision.<p><b>&#8220;Two hundred denarii</b><br>A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer in the Roman Empire, making two hundred denarii a substantial amount of money. This figure emphasizes the enormity of the crowd and the seeming impossibility of feeding them with available resources. The mention of such a specific amount suggests a calculated response, indicating Philip's attempt to quantify the need in human terms. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human insufficiency contrasted with divine abundance.<p><b>would not buy enough bread</b><br>Bread, a staple food in the ancient Near East, symbolizes sustenance and life. In the context of the miracle, bread also serves as a type of Christ, who later in this chapter declares Himself to be the "bread of life." The insufficiency of earthly bread to meet the crowd's needs points to the greater spiritual truth that only Jesus can truly satisfy human hunger.<p><b>for each of them to have a small piece.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "small piece" highlights the inadequacy of human solutions to meet the needs of the multitude. This situation sets the stage for Jesus to demonstrate His divine power and compassion by providing abundantly. The miracle that follows not only meets the physical needs of the crowd but also serves as a sign pointing to Jesus' identity as the Messiah. This event foreshadows the Last Supper and the Eucharist, where Jesus offers Himself as spiritual nourishment for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles, known for his practical and sometimes skeptical nature.

Philip&#8217;s immediate reply shows he is taking the question at face value, running the numbers rather than looking to the Lord for a miracle.<p>&#8211; Scripture notes that Jesus asked &#8220;to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-6.htm">John 6:6</a>). Like Gideon facing the Midianite army (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>), Philip is brought to the end of human calculation so that God&#8217;s power will stand out.<p>&#8211; Philip had earlier witnessed Jesus turn water into wine (<a href="/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-11</a>) and heal the royal official&#8217;s son (<a href="/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46-54</a>), yet he still defaults to natural reasoning. The contrast prepares us to see how faith must grow beyond what the eye can see (<a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two hundred denarii</b><p>&#8211; A denarius equaled about one day&#8217;s wage (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>). Two hundred of them represent roughly eight months of labor&#8212;an amount far beyond what the disciples carried in their common purse (<a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Mark&#8217;s parallel account records the same figure (<a href="/mark/6-37.htm">Mark 6:37</a>), confirming that the disciples had already discussed the cost. Their unanimous conclusion underscores the impossibility.<p>&#8211; Faced with a price tag he can&#8217;t pay, Philip voices the financial barrier. As with the widow&#8217;s last meal before Elijah arrived (<a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12-16</a>), God allows the need to stand in stark relief so that His provision shines brighter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Would not buy enough bread</b><p>&#8211; Even if the disciples had the money, the surrounding villages could not have supplied sufficient loaves for a crowd of &#8220;about five thousand men, besides women and children&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-21.htm">Matthew 14:21</a>).<p>&#8211; Human resources and marketplaces fall short, just as Israel once stood before the Red Sea with no path forward (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>). These moments show that only the Lord can meet needs exceeding human supply lines (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For each of them to have a small piece</b><p>&#8211; Philip isn&#8217;t dreaming of a feast; he is calculating for crumbs. His phrase pictures a token bite per person&#8212;still beyond reach.<p>&#8211; The disciples&#8217; minimalist expectation contrasts with the abundance Jesus soon provides: &#8220;So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-13.htm">John 6:13</a>). God not only meets needs but overflows (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p>&#8211; Elijah multiplied a widow&#8217;s oil until every vessel was full (<a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1-7</a>). Jesus likewise proves that divine supply never runs dry, turning the disciples&#8217; &#8220;small piece&#8221; mindset into overflowing baskets.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Philip&#8217;s reply spotlights human limitation: money is short, markets are inadequate, and expectations are small. Jesus deliberately draws this confession out so the coming miracle will unmistakably declare His sovereignty as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). When our calculations fall flat, Christ remains more than sufficient, able to turn scarcity into surplus and doubt into expanding faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Philip answered him.</span>--The answer proves that Philip has not really learnt the lessons of the earlier teaching. The question does not suggest to him the true answer of divine sufficiency, but leads him to think of the human difficulty. He looks on the vast throng of people. At the lowest estimate, it would take the value of 200 denarii to feed them--in present money-value nearly 7; in actual labour-value nearly a workman's yearly wage. The denarius is the value of a day's work in the parable (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm" title="And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:2</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In A.D. 14, on the accession of Tiberius, one of the causes of revolt in the Pannonian legions is the smallness of their pay, and one of their demands (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Ann. i.</span> 26) is a penny a day. For Philip this large sum seems an impossibility. He states the difficulty, and leaves it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Philip took a calculating method of meeting the difficulty, and looked at the question as one which their entire resources were unable to solve. He did not so much as think of the "whence," or from what quarter the loaves could be procured, as how much money would be required to meet the ease. <span class="cmt_word">Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of loaves are not sufficient for them, that each</span> <span class="cmt_word">one</span> <span class="cmt_word">may</span> <span class="cmt_word">take a little.</span> The <span class="accented">denarius</span> was equal to about eightpence halfpenny of our money; so that the sum spoken of, probably representing the entire contents of their common purse, was only six pounds fifteen shillings, and was utterly insufficient for the purpose. The conversation preserved by Mark (<a href="/mark/6-35.htm">Mark 6:35-37</a>) cannot well be made part of this language of Philip, but rather follows when the short afternoon was coming on, and the long shadows indicated the near approach of darkness. Philip had told the other disciples of the Lord's question, and they had discussed the possible perils of the case and the intentions of the Lord. It is interesting to see, in Mark, that the same sum was mentioned as being insufficient for the needs of the great multitudes. John has not only abridged the narrative of the synoptists, but added a feature which is of interest, and shows how for some hours the disciples had meditated on what they fancied would be necessary, and had come to the somewhat unwelcome conclusion that they must sacrifice their entire stock of funds. The Lord had first of all made the suggestion. They now go to him, to beseech his influence to send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and <span class="accented">buy themselves something to eat</span>. When the enigmatic words burst from his lips, "Give ye them to eat," the two hundred pennyworth of bread is once more referred to by the disciples as insufficient (<a href="/luke/9-12.htm">Luke 9:12, 13</a>; <a href="/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15-17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Philip</span><br /><span class="grk">&#934;&#943;&#955;&#953;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Philippos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5376.htm">Strong's 5376: </a> </span><span class="str2">From philos and hippos; fond of horses; Philippus, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Two hundred</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#963;&#943;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Diakosi&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Genitive Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1250.htm">Strong's 1250: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two hundred.
