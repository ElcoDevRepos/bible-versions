The "result" refers to the growing hostility from the Jewish leaders following the raising of Lazarus, which is detailed earlier in <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>. The Sanhedrin had convened to discuss how to handle Jesus, fearing that His growing influence could lead to Roman intervention (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-53</a>). This decision to no longer move publicly among the Jews marks a strategic withdrawal to avoid premature arrest and to fulfill His mission according to divine timing. This action reflects Jesus' awareness of the increasing danger and His obedience to the Father's will, aligning with the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim</b><br>Ephraim is identified as a town near the wilderness, providing a place of relative seclusion. This withdrawal is not out of fear but a deliberate choice to continue His ministry without direct confrontation with the authorities until the appointed time. Ephraim's exact location is debated, but it is generally considered to be in the region of Samaria, north of Jerusalem. This move also symbolizes a temporary retreat from the center of Jewish religious life, Jerusalem, allowing Jesus to prepare His disciples for the events to come.<p><b>in an area near the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness often symbolizes a place of testing, preparation, and divine encounter in biblical narratives. It recalls the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and Jesus' own temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). This setting provides a backdrop for reflection and teaching, away from the immediate threats posed by the Jewish leaders. The wilderness serves as a place of refuge and spiritual preparation for Jesus and His disciples as they approach the culmination of His earthly ministry.<p><b>And He stayed there with the disciples</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of Jesus' relationship with His disciples. During this time, Jesus likely continued to teach and prepare them for His impending death and resurrection. The disciples' presence indicates their commitment and the intimate community they shared with Jesus. This period of seclusion would have been crucial for reinforcing their understanding of His mission and the coming of the Holy Spirit, as later expounded in the Upper Room Discourse (John 14-16).

The move was neither fear nor retreat from mission; it safeguarded the appointed hour, provided spiritual preparation for the Twelve, and demonstrated that the Messiah governs every detail of His path to the cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(54) <span class= "bld">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews.</span>--He had heard of the decree of the Sanhedrin which had been publicly made known (<a href="/john/11-57.htm" title="Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.">John 11:57</a>), and therefore avoided persons who would have carried it into effect.<p>"The Jews" are, as before, the hostile party. The passage is a good illustration of St. John's use of the term, for He was of course among Jews, in the ordinary meaning of the word, during the sojourn at Ephraim. (Comp.

He went from Bethany, when He had heard of what had taken place at Jerusalem, "into the country." This is further defined as "near to the wilderness," and then the name of the city is given.<p><span class= "bld">Into a city called Ephraim.</span>--The position of this "city" is not known. The MSS. spell it variously as <span class= "ital">Ephraim, Ephrem, Ephram,</span> and <span class= "ital">Ephratha.</span> Eusebius and Jerome both assumed it to be the same place as Ephron, but differed as to its position, the former fixing it at eight, and the latter at twenty miles, north-east from Jerusalem. Both would place it, therefore, in Judaea; and this agrees with its position "near to the wilderness," for the desert of Judaea extended nearly as far as Jericho. In <a href="/2_chronicles/13-19.htm" title="And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.">2Chronicles 13:19</a>, we have an Ephrain or Ephron (according to the written text and the LXX.) in connection with the neighbourhood of Bethel. This is mentioned by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iv. 9, ? 9), and is near to the wilderness of Bethaven. It is possibly the place named here; but a Jew would naturally use the phrase, "the wilderness," to mean the desert of Judaea. Dr. Robinson would identify Ephraim and Ephron with Ophrah (<a href="/joshua/18-23.htm" title="And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,">Joshua 18:23</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-23.htm" title="And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.">1Samuel 17:23</a>), and fix the locality at the modern <span class= "ital">el-Taiyibeh,</span> four or five miles east from Bethel, and sixteen from Jerusalem, which would agree roughly with the position assigned by Jerome. We must be content to leave the matter in this uncertainty. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Note</span> on <a href="/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.">Luke 17:11</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - This constituted the close of his earthly ministry after his ordinary method. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore walked</span> (cf. <a href="/john/7-1.htm">John 7:1</a>) <span class="cmt_word">no more openly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>; cf. <a href="/john/7-4.htm">John 7:4</a>) a<span class="cmt_word">mong the Jews; but he deputed thence into the country nigh unto the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim</span>. Westcott says the place is mentioned in connection with Bethel (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>). Not far from Bethel, on the border between Benjamin and Ephraim, is <span class="accented">Taiyibeh</span> a conical hill with a village perched aloft, which Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:127) and Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 210) identify with this Ephraim. In this form the word does not appear in the Old Testament, but Ensebius and Jerome make it twelve miles from Jerusalem, on the east of the road leading to Sichem; and Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 4:09.9) speaks of "two little towns of Bethela and Ephraim, through which Vespasian passed and left garrisons." Hengstenberg identifies it with "Baal-hazor, which is by Ephraim" (<a href="/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23</a>). The maps of Van der Welt and of the Palestine Exploration Society place it on the site of Ephraim, Ephron (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>), or Ophrah (<a href="/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>), about seven miles north-east from Bethel, and give as second designation Apharaim. The intelligence must have reached our Lord that the Sanhedrin had formally pronounced sentence against him. This may have induced him to retire from Jerusalem until the next great feast, when he would publicly challenge their allegiance. From this neighborhood our Lord could (as we learn from the synoptists) have easily joined the caravan from Persea, which, after crossing Jordan near Jericho, there set its face towards Jerusalem, or the caravan which may have come through Samaria to Bethel. <span class="cmt_word">There he abode a</span> (<span class="accented">tarried</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with the disciples</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> (says Godet) is not synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;</span>, but equivalent to - he confined himself in the desert region north-east of Jerusalem to the company of the twelve. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-54.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As a result,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
