Throughout the Gospels, Jesus demonstrates awareness of His mission and the events leading to His crucifixion (<a href="/john/13.htm">John 13:1</a>, <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). This knowledge underscores His willing submission to the Father's plan, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. Jesus' awareness of His impending suffering and death also reflects His role as the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>stepped forward</b><br>Jesus' action of stepping forward signifies His courage and willingness to face His destiny. In the context of the Garden of Gethsemane, where this event takes place, Jesus' proactive approach contrasts with the disciples' fear and confusion. This act fulfills His earlier declaration that no one takes His life from Him, but He lays it down of His own accord (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>). It also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament types, such as Isaac willingly carrying the wood for his own sacrifice (<a href="/genesis/22-6.htm">Genesis 22:6</a>).<p><b>and asked them, &#8220;Whom are you seeking?&#8221;</b><br>By asking this question, Jesus takes control of the situation, demonstrating His authority even in the face of arrest. This question not only reveals the intentions of the arresting party but also serves to protect His disciples, as seen in the subsequent verses where He ensures their safety (<a href="/john/18-8.htm">John 18:8-9</a>). The question echoes God's inquiries throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>, where God asks Adam, "Where are you?" It invites reflection on the true identity and mission of Jesus, prompting those present to confront their understanding of Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is portrayed as fully aware of the events that are about to unfold.

His action mirrors the shepherd who &#8220;lays down His life for the sheep&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11, 18</a>).<p>&#8226; The forward step fulfills prophetic willingness: &#8220;Then I said, &#8216;Here I am; I have come&#8212;it is written about Me in the scroll&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This movement separates Him from the disciples, shielding them (<a href="/john/18-8.htm">John 18:8</a>) and illustrating <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;He was led like a lamb to the slaughter&#8221; yet without protest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and asked them</b><p>&#8226; By initiating the conversation, Jesus maintains sovereign control of the scene. Earlier He declared, &#8220;No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The God who questioned Adam, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>), now questions those coming to seize Him. The pattern reveals divine initiative in redemption: God seeks, God speaks first.<p>&#8226; His question also grants the arresting party the opportunity to state their intent, exposing their hearts (cf. <a href="/mark/10-51.htm">Mark 10:51</a>, where He asks the blind man, though He knows).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Whom are you seeking?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This direct inquiry presses for a confession: are they after a political agitator or the Son of God? Their answer, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth&#8221; (<a href="/john/18-5.htm">John 18:5</a>), will soon meet His &#8220;I am He,&#8221; a revelation that briefly drives them backward (18:6).<p>&#8226; The same question bookends the Gospel: the risen Christ will ask Mary, &#8220;Whom are you seeking?&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>). Each encounter forces a decision about Jesus&#8217; identity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38</a> shows the first disciples answering this query; now hostile forces must respond. The repeated question challenges every reader to clarify personal pursuit or rejection of Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/18-4.htm">John 18:4</a> reveals a Savior fully aware, fully willing, and fully in charge. His knowledge proves divinity, His forward step demonstrates sacrificial courage, His question asserts authority, and the inquiry itself confronts every heart. The verse invites us to trust the One who knowingly, voluntarily, and sovereignly walked into suffering for our redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come </span>(better, <span class= "ital">were coming</span>) <span class= "bld">upon him.</span>--Comp. <a href="/matthew/26-45.htm" title="Then comes he to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.">Matthew 26:45</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> probably, went forth from the garden itself.

Other possible interpretations are, "went forth from the depth of the garden;" or, "went forth from the circle of the disciples standing round;" or, "went forth from the shade of the tree into the moonlight." For the word, comp. <a href="/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1</a>, and <a href="/matthew/14-14.htm" title="And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.">Matthew 14:14</a>).

But this is perfectly compatible with the obvious fact that the eight disciples and the favored three should have shrunk behind our Lord when he calmly emerged from the entrance to the garden, and that their position would be thus sufficiently indicated. It is remarkable that John, who has been accused of personal malice to Judas (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by those who, like Renan, admit, to a certain extent, the Johan-nine authorship), does not refer to the traitor's kiss. This well-attested and traditionally sustained incident is not excluded by the narrative before us - indeed, the second reference to Judas seems to imply something special in his conduct, which is needed to account for it. We can hardly suppose that it could have taken place before the Lord Jesus had uttered his solemn word, but it may easily have occurred as the first answer to his summons. <span class="cmt_word">And saith unto them, Whom seek ye</span>? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">knowing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eid&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(panta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
