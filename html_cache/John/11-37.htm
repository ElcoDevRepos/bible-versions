The "some" refers to the Jews who had come to comfort Mary and Martha. This reflects the common human tendency to question and doubt, especially in the face of suffering and death. It also highlights the presence of skepticism and disbelief among the witnesses of Jesus' miracles.<p><b>&#8220;Could not this man</b><br>The term "this man" refers to Jesus, emphasizing His humanity. Despite His miraculous works, some still viewed Him merely as a man, not fully recognizing His divine nature.

This miracle was significant because it fulfilled messianic prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened. It also demonstrated Jesus' authority over physical ailments and His power to bring spiritual enlightenment.<p><b>also have kept Lazarus from dying?&#8221;</b><br>The question implies a belief in Jesus' power to heal but doubts His power over death. It reflects a limited understanding of Jesus' mission and foreshadows the greater miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead.

James warns of the &#8220;one who doubts&#8221; being &#8220;like a wave of the sea&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6-8</a>).

Jesus answers not with words but with an even greater demonstration, bringing Lazarus back to life and revealing that His glory exceeds prevention; it conquers the grave itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">And some of them said.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">But some of them said</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> another party of the Jews, differing from those mentioned in the last verse.<p><span class= "bld">Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind</span> <span class= "bld">. .?</span>--They refer to the greatest miracle which had taken place within the limits of their own knowledge. The other miracles of raising the dead they must have heard of, but had not believed. What they think of here is not raising the dead, but the possibility of preventing death; and their question is meant to imply that He could not have prevented this death. If He could, surely He would have done so for one whom He had loved, and would have come at once, instead of waiting until death had taken place. The inference they would draw is that, after all, the present failure is a proof that He did not open the eyes of the blind.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">some</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#953;&#957;&#8050;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
