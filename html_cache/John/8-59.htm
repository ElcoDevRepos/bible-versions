This claim to the divine name "I AM" (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>) was considered blasphemous under Jewish law, which prescribed stoning as a punishment for blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). The act of picking up stones reflects the immediate and intense anger of the crowd, rooted in their understanding of the law and their cultural and religious zeal to protect the sanctity of God's name. This moment also highlights the growing tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, who increasingly saw Him as a threat to their power and religious traditions.<p><b>But Jesus was hidden</b><br>The phrase suggests a miraculous intervention or divine protection. Throughout the Gospels, there are instances where Jesus eludes capture or harm because His time had not yet come (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>, <a href="/john/10-39.htm">John 10:39</a>). This protection underscores the sovereignty of God over the events of Jesus' life, ensuring that His mission would be completed according to divine timing. It also reflects the theme of Jesus' control over His destiny, as He willingly lays down His life at the appointed time (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>).<p><b>and went out of the temple area.</b><br>The temple was the center of Jewish religious life, and Jesus' presence there during significant feasts, such as the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2</a>), was strategic for His ministry. His departure from the temple area signifies a temporary withdrawal from public confrontation with the religious leaders. This action can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would be rejected by His own people (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). It also foreshadows the eventual shift of God's presence from the physical temple to the spiritual temple of the believer's heart through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). Jesus' exit from the temple area marks a pivotal moment in His ministry, as He continues to reveal His identity and mission to those who have ears to hear.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God who is teaching in the temple.

<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a> prescribes stoning for blasphemy, so the crowd believes they are executing God&#8217;s law.<p>&#8226; Yet their zeal is selective; they ignored <a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6-7</a>, which requires proper testimony and judgment, not mob violence.<p>&#8226;

Yet the same verse displays God&#8217;s sovereign protection and Jesus&#8217; purposeful march toward the cross. Stones cannot touch Him until the appointed hour, and the temple cannot contain Him once it rejects Him. The scene calls every reader to the pivotal choice faced by that crowd: pick up stones in unbelief, or lay them down and worship the One who truly is.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(59) <span class= "bld">Then took they up stones to cast at him.</span>--At last the meaning of His words flashes upon them. They had heard this I AM before (<a href="/john/8-24.htm" title="I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.">John 8:24</a>) without perceiving that in it He applied to Himself the name Jehovah. Now there is no room for doubt. His own Divinity is the only explanation of what He has said; and it is in these words so plainly asserted, that those who had constantly misunderstood can misunderstand no more. The subtleties of later days, by which men have tried to show that there is no claim to Divinity here, was not suggested to their minds. They will not acknowledge the claim, but they feel that He has made it. They have heard the fearful words which seemed to them as blasphemy, and they take up the stones which are at hand for the rebuilding of the Temple, in which they are, to cast at the Lord of the Temple. (Comp. <a href="/john/10-33.htm" title="The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.">John 10:33</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</span>--These words are omitted in a majority of the better MSS.

(Comp. <a href="/luke/4-30.htm" title="But he passing through the middle of them went his way,">Luke 4:30</a>.) Here we are simply told that He "hid Himself and went out of the Temple, and this does not imply more than that He passed among the crowd which was around Him, out of the Temple, and thus avoided the stones which they had taken up to cast at Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 59.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> <span class="accented">The conflict and the victory. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Therefore</span> - because he said this, which if it had no basis in [act was rank blasphemy - <span class="cmt_word">they took up stones</span> of the temple court <span class="cmt_word">to cast at</span> (upon) <span class="cmt_word">him</span>.
