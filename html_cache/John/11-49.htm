His role was significant in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. As high priest, Caiaphas held considerable religious and political influence. His mention here sets the stage for his pivotal role in the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. Caiaphas was a Sadducee, a sect known for its collaboration with Roman authorities and denial of the resurrection, which contrasts with the Pharisees' beliefs.<p><b>who was high priest that year</b><br>The phrase "that year" emphasizes the specific time of Jesus' ministry and crucifixion, highlighting the providential timing of events. The high priesthood was a lifetime position, but during Roman rule, high priests were often replaced for political reasons. Caiaphas' tenure during this critical period underscores his involvement in the trial and condemnation of Jesus, fulfilling the divine plan for salvation.<p><b>said to them</b><br>Caiaphas addresses the Sanhedrin, the Jewish council responsible for religious and legal matters. His authority as high priest gives weight to his words, influencing the council's decision-making. This moment reflects the tension between maintaining Jewish law and appeasing Roman rule, as the council grapples with Jesus' growing influence.<p><b>&#8220;You know nothing at all!</b><br>Caiaphas' rebuke indicates frustration with the council's indecision regarding Jesus. His statement suggests a lack of understanding or insight among the members, emphasizing his own perceived wisdom and authority. This phrase foreshadows his proposal to sacrifice Jesus for the perceived greater good, unwittingly aligning with God's redemptive plan. Caiaphas' words echo the prophetic nature of his role, as he unknowingly speaks of Jesus' sacrificial death for the nation and beyond.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/caiaphas.htm">Caiaphas</a></b><br>The high priest during the time of Jesus' ministry.

Out of roughly seventy leaders, the Spirit zooms in on one voice. This focus reminds us how often God singles out an individual to advance His purpose&#8212;think of Gamaliel steering the council in <a href="/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34&#8211;39</a> or Joseph speaking up in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>. Here, amid political panic, one man will articulate a plan that unwittingly serves the divine storyline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Named Caiaphas</b><p>Caiaphas is no fictional figure; he appears across the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3</a>; <a href="/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a>) and in <a href="/acts/4-6.htm">Acts 4:6</a>. History locates him as high priest from A.D. 18-36, married into the powerful household of Annas. His name anchors the verse in real time and space, reinforcing the reliability of the narrative. Just as Isaiah pinpoints &#8220;King Uzziah&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>) or Luke lists rulers (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1-2</a>), John ties eternal truth to verifiable people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who was high priest that year</b><p>The high priest carried unique authority&#8212;only he could enter the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-32.htm">Leviticus 16:32-34</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>).

In the council&#8217;s echo chamber of fear, his voice slices through the confusion.

And Annas and Caiaphas are both said to be "high priests" (<a href="/luke/3-2.htm">Luke 3:2</a>). In <a href="/acts/4-6.htm">Acts 4:6</a> Annas is spoken of as high priest, Caiaphas being associated with "John and Alexander." This becomes more comprehensible when we learn from Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02. 2 and 4. 3) that Valerius Gratus (in the year A.D. ) had deprived Annas (or Hanan, Ananias, Ananas) of the office, "when he had held it for seven years." So great, however, was the influence of Annas, that, either to consult his temper or that of the people, who would consider him the legal high priest, the office was conferred upon members of his family in succession, first on Ishmael, then on Eleazer the son of Ishmael, then on Simon his son, and finally on Joseph Caiaphas (who is declared by St. John (<a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>) to be the son-in-law of Annas, thus explaining his appointment on the one hand, and the continued influence on the other of the unscrupulous Annas, who was high priest de <span class="accented">jure</span>). Joseph Caiaphas held the office from A.D. to A.D. , and thus throughout the ministry of Jesus. The apostle's remark (repeated <a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>) that he was "high priest that same year" has been set down by Strauss, Scholton, and others to ignorance on the part of the writer of the Hebrew law of the priesthood. This is excessively improbable, even with a late author of the second century, who evidently knew as much concerning Judaea and its history as the author of the Fourth Gospel did indubitably possess. It is enough that the evangelist singles out "that memorable year" (Lucke, Meyer and Lunge, etc.) of the death of Christ; and remarks on the man who was holding the position at this solemn time, with obvious reference to the fact that now for many years the functions of the high priest were discharged only at the pleasure of the Roman governor, who might, as Caiaphas himself said, abolish the office altogether if he chose arbitrarily to do so. The first words of Caiaphas, "Ye know nothing at all," are brusque, rough, imperious, but are quite akin to what we know elsewhere of the manners of the man (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 14), and of the aristocratic clique of which he was the head. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7991;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Heis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
