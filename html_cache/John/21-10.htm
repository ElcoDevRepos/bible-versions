It is significant that Jesus, post-resurrection, continues to guide and direct His followers, emphasizing His ongoing role as teacher and leader. This moment occurs after His resurrection, underscoring His victory over death and His divine authority. The disciples recognize His voice and authority, reminiscent of <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>, where Jesus says, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."<p><b>&#8220;Bring some of the fish</b><br>The act of bringing fish is symbolic of the disciples' mission to be "fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). The fish represent the fruits of their labor and obedience to Jesus' command. This moment is a reminder of the miraculous catch of fish earlier in Jesus' ministry (<a href="/luke/5.htm">Luke 5:1-11</a>), reinforcing the idea that success in their mission comes through obedience to Christ. The fish also symbolize provision and sustenance, both physically and spiritually, as Jesus provides for their needs.<p><b>you have just caught.&#8221;</b><br>The emphasis on "just caught" highlights the immediacy and recent success of their efforts, which were only fruitful because of Jesus' guidance. This underscores the theme of divine provision and the importance of following Jesus' instructions. The miraculous catch serves as a tangible reminder of Jesus' power and the blessings that come from following Him. It also points to the new era of ministry the disciples are entering, where they will rely on the Holy Spirit for guidance and success in their mission to spread the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ who appears to His disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.

The implication is that to the scanty meal already provided, the new supply was added, and that the Lord permitted his disciples to join his repast, and to rejoice with him at the success of their labor. They and he shared in the travail, and were satisfied therewith.
