This festival was one of the three major Jewish feasts, drawing large crowds to the city. Jesus often used these gatherings to teach and reveal His identity. His response is part of a larger dialogue where He addresses the skepticism and hostility of the religious leaders. This phrase indicates a direct engagement with His audience, emphasizing His role as a teacher and authority.<p><b>I did one miracle</b><br>The miracle Jesus refers to is likely the healing of the man at the Pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath, as recorded in <a href="/john/5.htm">John 5:1-15</a>. This act of healing was significant because it challenged the Jewish leaders' strict interpretation of the Sabbath laws. The miracle demonstrated Jesus' authority over the Sabbath and His divine power to heal, which was a sign of the coming Messianic age prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>. This miracle was not just a display of power but a revelation of Jesus' identity as the Son of God.<p><b>and you are all amazed</b><br>The amazement of the people reflects the impact of Jesus' miraculous works and teachings. In the Jewish context, miracles were seen as signs of divine intervention. However, the amazement also highlights a division among the people: some were open to believing in Jesus as the Messiah, while others, particularly the religious leaders, were skeptical and even hostile. This amazement can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>, where God promises to do a marvelous work that would astonish the people.
