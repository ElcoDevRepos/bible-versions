John the Baptist, the speaker, had a direct encounter with Jesus. In the context of the Gospel of John, seeing often implies a deeper understanding or revelation. John the Baptist's role as a forerunner to Christ is emphasized here, as he was divinely appointed to recognize and announce the Messiah. This aligns with the prophetic role described in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, where a voice cries out in the wilderness to prepare the way for the Lord.<p><b>and testified</b><br>The act of testifying is central to the mission of John the Baptist. In Jewish culture, the testimony of two or three witnesses was required to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). John&#8217;s testimony about Jesus serves as a legal and spiritual affirmation of Jesus' identity. His testimony is not based on hearsay but on direct revelation from God, as seen earlier in <a href="/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32-33</a>, where he describes the Spirit descending on Jesus.<p><b>that this is the Son of God.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is a profound theological statement. The title "Son of God" affirms the divinity of Jesus, a core tenet of Christian belief. In the Old Testament, the term "son of God" could refer to angels, Israel, or the Davidic king, but in the New Testament, it uniquely identifies Jesus as divine. This title connects to <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, a messianic psalm, and is further affirmed in the New Testament in passages like <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, where God declares Jesus as His beloved Son. The recognition of Jesus as the Son of God is foundational to understanding His mission and the salvation He offers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A pivotal figure in the New Testament, John the Baptist is the one who makes the declaration in this verse.

The result of personal conviction was, that he forthwith testified to others, and continued to do so until the present. One of the sayings taught to his scholars was, "He was (existed) before me." The revelation of the baptism and the voice heard from heaven (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>) has given to this its true meaning. Teacher has now learnt, and learner is now taught, that Jesus is this pre-existent Being, the Messiah, the Son of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I for my part have seen and have borne testimony that this is the Son of God</span>. The Old Testament standpoint which John occupied enabled him from the first to identify the Messiah with the "Son of God;" but surely this is the record of the first occasion when the Baptist recognized the token that One who sustained such relation with the Father stood before him. There is much in this Gospel and the synoptic narrative to show that the disciples (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16, 17</a>) identified the Christ with the Son of God. The tempter and the demoniacs are familiar with the idea (<a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>; <a href="/mark/3-11.htm">Mark 3:11</a>; <a href="/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>). The high priest at the trial and the Roman centurion (<a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a>; <a href="/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61</a>), Nathanael (<a href="/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>), Martha (<a href="/john/11-27.htm">John 11:27</a>), hail him as Son of God. Though the Lord for the most part preferred to speak of himself as "Son of man," yet in this Gospel (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-23</a>; <a href="/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>; <a href="/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>) he frequently claims this lofty designation. Nor is it confined to this Gospel, for in <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25-27</a>, we have practically the same confession. Now, the declaration of this verse is in intimate connection with what precedes. Neither the Baptist nor the evangelist implies that, by Christ's baptism, and by that which John saw of the descent and abiding of the Spirit upon the Lord, he was there and then constituted "the Son of God." From this misapprehension of the Gospel arose the Gnostic-Ebionite view of the heavenly <span class="accented">Soter</span> descending on Christ, to depart from him at the Crucifixion. The main significance of the entire paragraph is the special revelation given to John, his consequent illumination and momentous testimony, one that sank into the soul of his most susceptible disciples, and thus made this declaration the "<span class="accented">true birth hour of Christendom"</span> (Ewald, Meyer). The narrative does not imply that Christ's own consciousness of Divine sonship then commenced. He knew who he was when he spoke, at twelve years of age, of "the business of my Father;" but it would be equally inadequate exegesis to suppose that no communication was then made to the sacred humanity which had been fashioned by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin, and by which he became from the first "the Son of God." The Lord's humanity did become alive to the solemn and awful responsibilities of this public recognition. He knew that the hour was come for his Messianic activity, and the distinct admission of this was the basis of each of the diabolic temptations from which he immediately suffered. There was a unique glory in this sonship which differed from all other usage of the same phrase. Many an Oriental mystic and Egyptian pharaoh and even Roman emperor had thus described themselves; but the Baptist did not speak of himself in this or any other sense as "Son of God." There was flashed into his mind the light of a Divine relationship between Jesus and the Father which convinced him of the preexisting life of him who was chronologically coming after him. It was probably this momentous utterance which led to the deputation of the Sanhedrin, and induced them to ask for the explanation of a mystery transcending all that John had said from the day of his showing unto Israel" (see my 'John the Baptist,' lect. 6. &sect; 1). Many commentators here encounter the unquestionable difficulty of John the Baptist's message from the prison. I prefer to discuss it at the close of ch. 3. (see my 'John the Baptist,' lect. 7: "The Ministry of the Prison"). Here it is sufficient to observe that the vivid intuition and revelation which John obtained touching the deep things of God in Christ, and the vast and far-reaching testimonies which he bore to the Son of God, to the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, the pre-existent glory of him that came after him, and to "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world," were, nevertheless, in <span class="accented">the evangelist's mind historically coincident</span> with the fact that John never did unite himself to the circle of Christ's immediate followers. The "John" of the Fourth Gospel remained in an independent position - friendly, rejoicing in the Bridegroom's voice, but not one of his followers. The preparatory work with which he began his ministry he continued and pursued to the tragic end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#7936;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(kag&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2504.htm">Strong's 2504: </a> </span><span class="str2">To also, I too, but I.
