It reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which speaks of Immanuel, "God with us." The presence of Jesus in the world signifies God's direct intervention in human history, a pivotal moment that had been anticipated by the Jewish people.<p><b>and though the world was made through Him</b><br>This highlights the role of Jesus as the divine Logos, the Word through whom all things were created, as stated in <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>. It connects to <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks creation into existence, and <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>, which affirms that all things were created through and for Christ. This underscores His preexistence and divine authority over creation.<p><b>the world did not recognize Him</b><br>Despite Jesus' divine nature and the testimony of creation itself, humanity failed to acknowledge Him as the Messiah. This reflects the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart prevalent among people, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the suffering servant as "despised and rejected by men."

Jesus truly entered the world He Himself fashioned, yet the majority failed to know their Maker. The verse calls readers to move from blindness to recognition, from indifference to worship, embracing the One who both formed the universe and walked its dusty paths for our redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">In the world.</span>--This manifestation in the flesh recalls the pre-incarnate existence during the whole history of the world, and the creative act itself. (Comp. <a href="/context/john/1-2.htm" title="The same was in the beginning with God.">John 1:2-3</a>, Note). The two facts are the constant presence of the true Light, and the creation of the world by Him. The world, then, in its highest creature man, with spiritual power for seeing the true Light, ought to have recognised Him. Spirit ought to have felt and known His presence. In this would have been the exercise of its true power and its highest good. But the world was sense-bound, and lost its spiritual perception, and "knew Him not." This verse brings back again the thought of <a href="/context/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3-5</a>, to prepare for the deeper gloom which follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="accented">The twofold effect of the pre-Incarnation activity in the elected nation and individuals.</span> The highest expression of this truth was seen in the unique "coming" of which the evangelist had been the spectator and witness; but the words cannot be limited to it - they stretch back to the beginning of the creation of the world and on to the final consummation. They explain or divide the solemn theme of the previous announcement into two related proofs of the fact that the Light which illumines every man shineth in darkness, and that the darkness apprehendeth it not. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Of him who was evermore coming into the world, it is said, <span class="cmt_word">In the world he was, and the world was made</span> (came into being) <span class="cmt_word">through him, and the world recognized him not</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is a term specially used by St. John to denote the ordered whole of the universe, viewed <span class="accented">apart</span> from God (see Introduction). Sometimes this is emphasized by the pronoun, "<span class="accented">This</span> world," when it is contrasted with the higher and heavenly "order" to which the Lord's personality belonged, both before and after this manifestation in the flesh. From being thus the scene of ordered existence apart from God, it rapidly moves into the organized resistance to the will of God, and therefore it often denotes humanity taken as a whole apart from God and grace. It may be the object of the Divine love and compassion (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>), while the redemption and deliverance of the world from sin is the great end of the ministry and work of Jesus (ver. 29); but throughout this gospel "the world" is the synonym of the adverse power and order of humanity, until it is illumined, regenerated, by the Spirit of God. The world here signifies humanity and its dwelling place, considered apart from the changes wrought in any part of it by grace. The three assertions concerning the world drop the imagery of light and life, and by their emphatic concatenation, without the assistance of a Greek particle, tell the tragic story of human departure from God. Thus only can the mystery of the previous verses be explained. At the very forefront of the argument of the Gospel is put a statement which concedes the strange perplexity of the rejection of the incarnate Logos. Not only does the entire narrative illustrate the awful fact, strange and inconceivable as such an idea appears when baldly stated, but the author generalizes the antipathy between the Logos and the world into a more comprehensive, damning, and yet undeniable, proposition. From the beginning, though the world came into being through the Logos, though he was in the world, in every atom of matter, in every vibration of force, in every energy of life, yet the world, notwithstanding all its power of recognizing the fact, yet the world, as concentrated in an antagonistic humanity, <span class="accented">did not</span> come to know him fully (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>). This is the lesson we learn from all the melancholy and tragic perversions of his glorious perfections which every heathenism and every cultus, and even every philosophy, has perpetrated. St. Paul says precisely the same thing: "The world by wisdom knew not God" (see also <a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19-22</a>, which might be taken as an inspired commentary on the whole passage). And the awful statement is still, with reference to the majority of men, true, that "the world knoweth not God, neither the Father, nor the Word, nor the Holy Ghost." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
