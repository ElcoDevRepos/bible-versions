The term "Sir" indicates respect and a recognition of authority, though the man does not yet fully understand who Jesus is. This moment occurs after the man has been cast out by the Pharisees for defending Jesus. The question reflects a genuine desire to know the identity of the one who healed him. In the broader biblical context, this question echoes the search for truth and understanding seen throughout Scripture, such as in the inquiries of Nicodemus in <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3</a> or the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>.<p><b>he replied.</b><br>The man&#8217;s response is immediate, showing his openness and readiness to learn more about the one who healed him. This reflects a heart that is prepared to receive truth, contrasting with the hardened hearts of the Pharisees. His willingness to engage in dialogue is reminiscent of other biblical figures who sought understanding, such as the Ethiopian eunuch in <a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>.<p><b>Tell me so that I may believe in Him.</b><br>This phrase indicates the man's readiness to place his faith in Jesus once he knows who He is. The concept of belief is central to the Gospel of John, where faith is not just intellectual assent but a deep trust and commitment. The man's openness to belief contrasts with the skepticism and unbelief of the religious leaders. This moment foreshadows the fuller revelation of Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>, which speaks of opening the eyes of the blind. The man's journey from physical blindness to spiritual sight is a type of the transformative power of Christ, who brings light to those in darkness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was born blind and healed by Jesus.

He knows the title but not the Person, mirroring seekers like the Ethiopian eunuch (<a href="/acts/8-34.htm">Acts 8:34</a>).<p>- Calling Jesus &#8220;Sir&#8221; shows reverence; the same word later means &#8220;Lord&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>).

He recognises Him by the voice which he had heard before, and now for the first time sees Him. He is ready to believe on the Messiah whom all expected, and he feels that this prophet, who had opened his eyes, can tell him who the Messiah is. The form of the question, "Who is He?" suggests that he half expected that He, upon whom he looked, was more than a prophet, and was none other than the Messiah Himself. In the absence of any such thought, the question would have taken a vague form, such as "Where is He?" or "When shall He appear?" He asks as one who knows that the object of his faith is at hand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He answered and said,</span> <span class="cmt_word">And who is he, that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I may believe on him?</span> The conjunction adds much to the eagerness of the reply. His faith was ready for full expression. He half suspected, as the Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>) did, that Jesus was pointing to himself. The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>; rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>; ("who?" rather than "what?") shows the intensity of the man's desire to find and hail and trust "the Son of God." The disposition, the posture, of his mind is that of faith. The adequate object for that faith has not been revealed to him. Apt symbol of many in their passage from darkness to light. When receptive, susceptible, conscious of need, with some notion, though an obscure one, of whom and of what they most of all need, many are disposed even now to utter the same importunate request. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
