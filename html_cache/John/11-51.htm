His statement was not merely a personal opinion but was influenced by divine intervention. This reflects the biblical theme that God can use even those who do not believe in Him to fulfill His purposes, as seen in examples like Balaam in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>. Caiaphas's words were part of a larger divine plan, demonstrating God's sovereignty over human affairs.<p><b>Instead, as high priest that year,</b><br>The role of the high priest was central in Jewish religious life, serving as a mediator between God and the people. Caiaphas held this position during a critical time in Jewish history, around AD 18-36. The high priesthood was a position of both religious and political power, often appointed by Roman authorities, which added complexity to Caiaphas's role. His position gave his words weight and authority, even as God used his office to deliver a prophecy.<p><b>he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation,</b><br>Caiaphas's statement unwittingly pointed to the sacrificial death of Jesus, which was central to God's redemptive plan. This prophecy aligns with Old Testament predictions of a suffering Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of one who would bear the sins of many. Jesus's death was not just for the Jewish nation but for all humanity, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that through his offspring all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).

His office lends weight, the Spirit supplies the words, and the message spotlights Jesus&#8217; substitutionary death for Israel&#8212;and ultimately for all God&#8217;s scattered children. What Caiaphas meant for expedience, God meant for redemption, confirming that every detail of the cross was scripted by heaven for our salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51) <span class= "bld">And this spake he not of himself.</span>--There is a moral beauty in the Words, in spite of the diabolical intent with which they are uttered; and St. John adds the explanation that they had an origin higher than him who spake them. Writing after the events, he has seen them fulfilled, and regards them as an unconscious prophecy. Like another Balaam, Caiaphas was the oracle or God in spite of himself, and there is in his words a meaning far beyond any that he had intended.<p><span class= "bld">Being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation.</span>--He stood, therefore, in a relation which made him the official representative of God to the people, and gave him an official capacity to convey God's truth. This was represented in the days of Samuel by the Urim and Thummim; and John, himself a Jew, still thinks of the high priest's breast as bearing the oracle which declared the will of God, whatever unworthy human thoughts may have filled the heart beneath. It may be that another reference to the high priest's office is present in these thrice-written words. It was the high priest's duty to "enter within the veil," and "make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year" (Leviticus 16). In that year the veil was rent, and the first step taken by which the holy place was destroyed, and the high priest's office ceased to exist. With the destruction of the holy place the Jewish day of Atonement lost its significance, but the high priest that year, by his counsel and action in the Sanhedrin, was causing the sacrifice which should be presented by another high priest, in the Holy of Holies as an Atonement for the world--"Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption" (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 51, 52.</span> - The evangelist discerned the presence of a deeper meaning in his words not intended by himself. As Balaam and Nebuchadnezzar and even Pharaoh had uttered unconscious or unwilling prophecies, and as in all genuine prophecies there are <span class="accented">meanings meant</span> by God beyond what the utterer of them at all conceived possible. So here. <span class="cmt_word">This he spake not from himself: but being high priest that awful, critical year, he prophesied</span>. The high priest was believed in ancient times to have the power of drawing from Urim and Thummim the Divine decisions as to future events (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>, and Caiaphas, as priest-prophet, may thus have conveyed an awful and sublime truth through base and evil dispositions. Curious instances occur elsewhere (<a href="/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27, 35</a>): "He saved others; himself he cannot save!" (<a href="/mark/15-31.htm">Mark 15:31</a>); when the people said, "His blood be upon us" (<a href="/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a>); when Pilate, by unconscious prophecy, ironically declared him to be "King of the Jews" (<a href="/matthew/27-37.htm">Matthew 27:37</a>). Wunsche quotes a curious case of unconscious prophecy, which the rabbinical writers attributed to Pharaoh's daughter, when she forecast the future legislator in the infant derelict. The substance of the prophetic word extracted from his saying was that <span class="cmt_word">Jesus should die for the nation.</span> Hengstenberg wisely <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">Caiaphas</span> could not have spoken other than of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>." When John wrote, the difference between the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> had vanished away.

According to some, the dispersed Israelites, but surely the passage corresponds with the "other sheep," of <a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>, and refers to all who enter by living faith in <span class="accented">him</span> into the full realization of the Divine Fatherhood (see <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a> and <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>) and their own sonship.
