Jesus is preparing His disciples for His impending departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit. The "things" He has told them include the importance of abiding in Him, the promise of the Holy Spirit, and the command to love one another. This reflects the intimate relationship between Jesus and His followers, emphasizing the importance of His words as a source of guidance and comfort.<p><b>so that My joy may be in you</b><br>Jesus speaks of His own joy, which is rooted in His relationship with the Father and His obedience to the Father's will. This joy is not dependent on external circumstances but is a deep, abiding sense of fulfillment and peace. By sharing His teachings, Jesus desires that His disciples experience this same joy. The concept of joy in the Bible often relates to a sense of spiritual well-being and contentment that comes from a right relationship with God. This joy is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is available to believers who remain in Christ.<p><b>and your joy may be complete.</b><br>The completion of joy suggests a fullness or perfection that can only be achieved through a relationship with Jesus. This echoes the biblical theme of joy being made perfect in the presence of God (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). The idea of completeness also ties into the biblical concept of shalom, which encompasses peace, wholeness, and well-being. Jesus' desire is for His followers to experience a joy that is not partial or temporary but complete and eternal. This joy is a testament to the transformative power of living in accordance with Jesus' teachings and being in communion with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples during the Last Supper, imparting final teachings before His crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teachings, representing all believers who follow Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, a significant event where Jesus shares His final teachings and establishes the New Covenant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_source_of_true_joy.htm">The Source of True Joy</a></b><br>Jesus is the source of true joy, which is distinct from worldly happiness.

The brightness of that joy lit up the darkest hours of His own human life, and He wills that it should light up theirs. In the consciousness of their love to God, and of God's love to them, there would be in them, as part of their true life, joy which no sorrow could ever overcome. They were as men with troubled hearts. He has told them of the true source of peace. His own peace He has given to them. He tells them now of the source of joy, and has spoken the word that they may possess the very joy which was the light of His own heart.<p><span class= "bld">And that your joy might be full.</span>--Comp. the words of the Intercessory Prayer in <a href="/john/17-13.htm" title="And now come I to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.">John 17:13</a>, and the same phrase in <a href="/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>; <a href="/john/16-24.htm" title="Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.">John 16:24</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-4.htm" title="And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full.">1John 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-12.htm" title="Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.">2John 1:12</a>. The state of which He has spoken to them--the loving and being loved of God--is the ideal perfection of human life. It supplies satisfaction for all the deepest desires of our being. The capacities of the whole man are fulfilled in it, and the result is fulness of joy. They have learnt little of the true spirit of Christianity whose religion does not impart to them a joy which sheds its light over the whole of their lives. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11</span> - <a href="/john/16-6.htm">John 16:6</a>. - <p><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The <span class="accented">results of the union between Christ and his disciples</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-16.</span> - (a) <span class="accented">To themselves</span>. The Lord moves into another and wider development of the union between himself and his disciples. He drops the metaphor of the vine and the branches, and comes to the essence of the relation between them; that is, he does much to explain the meaning and nature of his abiding in them, and the character of the fruit which they were expected by the great Husbandman and Father to bring forth and ripen. A connection between the second section and the first is revealed in the new beginning. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things I have spoken, and am still speaking, to you</span> (perfect, not aorist) with this purpose, <span class="cmt_word">that the joy that is mine may be</span> <span class="cmt_word">in you</span>. This is variously explained. Augustine, "My joyfulness concerning you," which is scarcely the burden of the previous verses; Grotius, "Your delight in me," which would be somewhat tautologous; Calvin and De Wette, "The joyfulness capable of being produced in you by me, might be in you." But the words are more simply explained by Lange, Meyer, Lucke, Westcott, Alford, and Moulton, as the communication to his disciples of his own absolute and personal joy. "The joy that is mine," like "the peace which is mine," is graciously bestowed. A joy was set before him, the joy of perfect self-sacrifice, which gave to his present acts an intensity and fullness of bliss. It was this, in its motives and character and supernatural sweetness, which would be in them. If they receive his life into them, it will convey not only his <span class="accented">peace</span>, but that peace uprising and bursting into joy; and he adds, <span class="cmt_word">in order that your joy may be fulfilled</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. <span class="cmt_word"></span>perfected</span>, reach its highest expression, its fullness of contents and entire sufficiency for all needs. <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-4</a> is the best commentary on this last clause. The Old Testament prophets had often spoken of Jehovah's joy in his people, comparing it to the bridegroom's joy, and the bride's (<a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>). This entire idea is linked with Ver. 10; where the keeping of his commandments, from motives of love, will enable the disciples to "abide in his love." He now passes the whole law of the second table into the light of his joy and the power of his example. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/15-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I have told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#955;&#951;&#954;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(lelal&#275;ka)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2980.htm">Strong's 2980: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an otherwise obsolete verb; to talk, i.e. Utter words.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
