It sets the stage for the unfolding narrative and highlights the ongoing interest and pursuit of Jesus by the crowd. The timing is significant as it shows the immediacy of the crowd's reaction to Jesus' miracles.<p><b>the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea</b><br>The crowd refers to those who had witnessed or heard of the miracle of the loaves and fishes. "The other side of the sea" refers to the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, near Bethsaida. This area was less populated and served as a retreat for Jesus and His disciples. The crowd's presence indicates their eagerness to follow Jesus, seeking more signs or teachings.<p><b>realized that only one boat had been there</b><br>This observation by the crowd is crucial as it sets up the miraculous nature of Jesus' actions. The crowd's awareness of the single boat emphasizes their understanding of the logistics involved and their curiosity about Jesus' whereabouts. It also foreshadows the miraculous crossing of Jesus over the sea, which they did not witness.<p><b>and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples</b><br>The crowd's realization that Jesus did not accompany His disciples in the boat highlights their keen observation and interest in Jesus' movements. This detail underscores the mystery surrounding Jesus' actions and sets the stage for the revelation of His divine nature. It also points to the disciples' journey across the sea without Jesus, which is significant in the context of the subsequent miracle of Jesus walking on water.<p><b>but they had gone away alone</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the separation between Jesus and His disciples at this point in the narrative. The disciples' departure without Jesus is a key detail that adds to the crowd's confusion and anticipation.
