The concept of God giving believers to Jesus is rooted in the idea of divine election and predestination, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>. This reflects the belief that salvation is initiated by God and that believers are a gift to Christ, underscoring the security and assurance of their salvation. The Father&#8217;s role in giving believers to Jesus also points to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah gathering God&#8217;s people, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>.<p><b>is greater than all</b><br>This phrase asserts the supremacy and omnipotence of God the Father over all creation. It reflects the monotheistic belief central to Jewish and Christian theology that God is the ultimate authority and power. This statement can be connected to passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25-26</a>, which speak of God&#8217;s incomparable greatness. The phrase reassures believers of the security found in God&#8217;s power, as nothing can surpass or challenge His will. It also serves as a reminder of the divine hierarchy, where Jesus, though equal with God, submits to the Father&#8217;s authority, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>.<p><b>No one can snatch them out of My Father&#8217;s hand</b><br>This phrase provides a powerful assurance of the believer&#8217;s eternal security. The imagery of being in the Father&#8217;s hand suggests protection, care, and possession. It echoes the shepherd imagery found earlier in <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the Good Shepherd who protects His sheep. The idea of being unable to be snatched away is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>, where God is depicted as the shepherd of His people. This assurance is further supported by <a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>, which declares that nothing can separate believers from the love of God. The phrase emphasizes the permanence of salvation and the believer&#8217;s safety in God&#8217;s sovereign grip.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is affirming His divine relationship with the Father and His role as the Good Shepherd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>Referred to as "My Father," He is depicted as the ultimate authority and protector of believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers/sheep.htm">Believers/Sheep</a></b><br>Those who follow Jesus, given to Him by the Father, and are under divine protection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience of Jesus' discourse, often in opposition to His teachings and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, a central place for Jesus' ministry and confrontations with religious leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty_and_security.htm">Divine Sovereignty and Security</a></b><br>God's sovereignty is emphasized as He is "greater than all," ensuring the security of believers.<br><br>Believers can find comfort in the assurance that no external force can remove them from God's protection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_relationship_between_the_father_and_the_son.htm">The Relationship Between the Father and the Son</a></b><br>The unity and shared purpose between the Father and the Son are highlighted, showing the divine plan for salvation.<br><br>Understanding this relationship deepens our appreciation for the security offered to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_salvation.htm">The Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>This verse provides assurance of eternal security for those who are in Christ, emphasizing that salvation is not dependent on human effort.<br><br>Encourages believers to live confidently in their faith, knowing they are held securely by God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith_in_divine_protection.htm">The Role of Faith in Divine Protection</a></b><br>While divine protection is assured, believers are called to remain faithful and trust in God's promises.<br><br>Encourages a life of obedience and trust, reflecting the security and love received from God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_10_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 10:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_10_29_show_God_s_control.htm">How does John 10:29 affirm God's sovereignty in your daily life?

Note on <a href="/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>. Here our version has rightly made no limiting addition to "all" (comp. last verse). In the width of the word, which extends to every creature and to every power, and even to the Son in His subordination to the Father, the Father is thought of as greater than all. Again the thought mounts with each succeeding sentence: (1) "None shall pluck them out of My hand;" (2) "They are My Father's gifts, and He is greater than all;" (3) "None shall pluck them out of My Father's hand."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - The last statement is sustained by a still loftier assumption. Before translating, it is necessary to notice the three readings of the text. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That of the T.R. and the Revisers' Text: <span class="accented">My Father who gave</span> (<span class="accented">them</span>) <span class="accented">to me is greater than all</span> the powers that can possibly be arrayed against them. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, D, <span class="accented">With reference to that which my Father</span>, <span class="accented">One greater than all</span>, <span class="accented">gave me</span>, <span class="accented">and no one is able to pluck from the hand of the Father</span>. Meyer, however, translates this differently; he supposes the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to refer to the Father "a something greater, a greater potence." Westcott and Hort prefer the reading with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; and Westcott translates, <span class="accented">That which my Father has given me is greater than all</span>, and regards it as a reference to the sheep as a collective unity. The internal reasons compel Luthardt, Godet, and Lange to fall back on T.R., and surely the extraordinary strain of the meaning justifies them. Our Lord would sustain with even stronger assurance the safety of his sheep. The Father's gift to himself, the Father's own eternal love and power, the Divine omnipotence of the Lord God himself, is pledged to their security. "My hand" becomes "my Father's hand." He seems to say, "If you question my capacity, you need not question his power. Sacrilegious violence may apparently nail my hands to the cross; the sword may awake against Jehovah's Shepherd. But none can outwit, surprise, crucify, conquer, my Father, none can invalidate his care." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">My</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(mou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
