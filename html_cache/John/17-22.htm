The concept of "glory" in biblical terms often refers to the manifestation of God's presence and majesty. In the Old Testament, God's glory was revealed in the tabernacle and the temple (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). Here, Jesus speaks of a spiritual glory, indicating the divine nature and mission He shares with His followers. This glory is not just a future promise but a present reality, reflecting the transformative power of Christ's presence in believers' lives. The giving of glory also signifies the sharing of divine attributes, such as love, holiness, and truth, which are essential for the mission of the Church.<p><b>so that they may be one as We are one&#8212;</b><br>The purpose of imparting this glory is to achieve unity among believers, mirroring the perfect unity between the Father and the Son. This unity is not merely organizational or superficial but is deeply rooted in the spiritual and relational oneness that characterizes the Trinity. The unity of believers is a recurring theme in the New Testament, emphasized in passages like <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3-6</a>, where Paul urges the Church to maintain the unity of the Spirit. This oneness is a testimony to the world of the truth of the Gospel and the love of God (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>). The unity Jesus prays for is both a present experience and an eschatological hope, pointing to the ultimate reconciliation of all things in Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is praying to the Father, expressing His desire for unity among His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The recipient of Jesus' prayer, who has given glory to Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' prayer, representing all believers who are to receive the glory and unity Jesus speaks of.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The likely setting of this prayer, part of Jesus' farewell discourse to His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory.htm">The Glory</a></b><br>Refers to the divine presence and honor that Jesus shares with the Father, which He imparts to His followers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gift_of_glory.htm">The Gift of Glory</a></b><br>Jesus has given believers the same glory He received from the Father.

Now He adds another gift&#8212;glory.<p>&#8226; What has been given is not earned; it flows freely from Christ&#8217;s love (cf. <a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Every believer is included; the pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; reaches beyond the Eleven to &#8220;those who will believe in Me through their word&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the glory</b><p>&#8220;The glory&#8221; is the radiant manifestation of God&#8217;s presence and character.

In Jesus that longing is met: &#8220;We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This glory is moral and relational, not merely visual. It shines through holiness, love, and truth (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; It is shared, not hoarded. <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a> says we are &#8220;heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ,&#8221; destined to be &#8220;glorified with Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You gave Me</b><p>Christ&#8217;s glory is both eternal and received.

The gift has a goal: unity. God never gives without design (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The glory of Christ is the adhesive that binds His people.<p>&#8226; Like oil on Aaron&#8217;s beard (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1-2</a>), glory flows downward to create harmony.<p>&#8226; Wherever saints lose sight of Christ&#8217;s beauty, division grows; wherever His glory captivates, unity blossoms (<a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they may be one</b><p>Unity is not uniformity but a Spirit-wrought oneness of heart, mind, and purpose (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul pleads, &#8220;Make my joy complete by being of the same mind&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The Body has many members, yet &#8220;in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The world notices: &#8220;By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as We are one</b><p>The pattern for Christian unity is nothing less than the relationship within the Godhead.

Unity is therefore not a side project but the very aim of the gift.

Here, as all through this Intercessory Prayer, the future which immediately grows out of the present is regarded as present; the fulness of the glory which awaits Him at His Father's right hand is thought of as already given to Him; and the believers who have become, and will become, one with Him, to whom He has given eternal life (<a href="/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2</a>), are thought of as sharers in it. It is the thought which is expanded by St. Paul when he speaks of the children being "heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if we suffer with Him to the end that we may be also glorified with Him" (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>); and by St. John when he speaks of <span class= "ital">"</span>children of God being like Him because we shall see Him as He is" (<a href="/context/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.">1John 3:1-2</a>). In the original the pronoun "<span class= "ital">I</span>" is emphatically expressed. "The glory which Thou hast given Me," our Lord's words seem to mean, "I have on My part given to them. I have fulfilled the work which Thou hast given Me to do. I have made and declared an atonement between man and God. My work is done. I pray that Thou wouldst fulfil Thine own." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - Our Lord now proceeds to record how he has already contributed to produce this result. <span class="cmt_word">I also</span> - very emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">have given to them</span> - that is, to my disciples - <span class="cmt_word">the glory which thou gavest me</span>.

But the view variously set forth by Oldhausen, Hengstenberg, Maldonatus, Bengel, Tholuck, Moulton, and Godet appears to be in full harmony with the context, viz. the glory of the supernatural life of Divine Sonship and self-sacrificing love as of the very essence of God. This glory that he should taste death for every man, this glory of nature and character as the incarnate Head of a new humanity, I have given to them, <span class="cmt_word">in order that they may be one</span>, living in and for each other, <span class="cmt_word">even as we are one.</span> The contrast between his own relation to the Father and theirs is most wonderfully maintained. The union between the Father and Son is once more made the type, in his own unique consciousness, of the union among men who have received as his gift the eternal life and glory of a supernatural love.
