It connects to <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word who was with God and was God, and who became flesh. The concept of coming down from heaven also aligns with Old Testament imagery, such as the manna provided from heaven (Exodus 16), which Jesus later references in <a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>, identifying Himself as the true bread from heaven. This phrase underscores the incarnation, a central tenet of Christian theology, where God took on human form to fulfill His redemptive plan.<p><b>not to do My own will</b><br>Here, Jesus highlights His submission to the Father, a theme prevalent throughout the Gospels. This submission is not indicative of inferiority but rather a model of perfect obedience and unity within the Trinity. <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a> further illustrates this humility and obedience, as Jesus, though equal with God, took on the form of a servant. This phrase also reflects the cultural context of first-century Judaism, where obedience to God's will was paramount.<p><b>but to do the will of Him who sent Me</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes Jesus' mission and purpose, which is to fulfill the Father's will. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who accomplishes God's purpose. Jesus' mission is further clarified in passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-17</a>, where God's love and the sending of His Son are central to salvation. The phrase also reflects the Jewish concept of shaliach, where a sent one fully represents the sender, indicating Jesus' authority and divine mandate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is speaking about His divine mission and purpose on earth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The place from which Jesus claims to have come, indicating His divine origin and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>Referred to as "Him who sent Me," highlighting the relationship and mission given to Jesus by God the Father.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_will_of_god.htm">The Will of God</a></b><br>The divine purpose and plan that Jesus is committed to fulfilling, as opposed to His own will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_incarnation.htm">The Incarnation</a></b><br>The event of Jesus coming down from heaven to earth, emphasizing His role in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_mission.htm">Understanding Divine Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' purpose was divinely ordained, reminding us to seek God's will in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/submission_to_god's_will.htm">Submission to God's Will</a></b><br>Jesus exemplifies perfect submission, challenging us to prioritize God's plans over our own desires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God is central to the Christian life, as demonstrated by Jesus' life and mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_humility.htm">The Role of Humility</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to come down from heaven teaches us the value of humility in serving God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_purpose.htm">Living with Purpose</a></b><br>Like Jesus, we are called to live with a clear sense of purpose, aligned with God's will for our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_6_38_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 6:38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_6_38_show_Jesus_obedience.htm">How does John 6:38 demonstrate Jesus' submission to the Father's will?

He has spoken of the Father's gift and of human action. He now once more identifies His own will with that of the Father, and yet states the fact of His possessing an independent will. It cannot be that He should cast out any one who comes. He knows, indeed, with the knowledge of human nature, how hard it is for men to read the spiritual through the sensuous, and what are the hindrances in the way of every seeker of truth. Added to this, He knows, with a divine knowledge, what is the infinite love of the Father, and He has Himself come down from heaven to fulfil heaven's will in love to man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because I came down from heaven</span> (cf. <a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>), <span class="cmt_word">not that I might do my own will, but the will of him that sent me</span> (see <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19, 30</a>, notes). The practical, ethical force of this statement is to shape and defend the previous assurance. Christ's gracious reception and benediction is in willing harmony with, and not in opposition to, the Father's heart. There is no schism between the Father and Son. A separate will in and of itself assigned to the Son is not inconceivable, nay, it is imperatively necessary to posit, or we should lose all distinctions whatever between the Father and Son, between God and Christ. But the very separateness of the wills gives the greater significance to their moral oneness. "Not my will, but thine be done," "Not as I will, but as thou wilt," involve submission, voluntary surrender, to the Father's will; but here the Lord insists on absolute harmony and free cooperation. The bare idea of the Incarnation suggests the conditions of freedom which might conceivably issue in divarication of interest and aim. Christ declares that the Divine commission of his humanity is the spontaneous and free, but perfect, coincidence of his will with the Father's. Christ's embodiment of the Father's will, and coordination with it, make all his attractiveness to the human soul. His healing, feeding, and satisfying powers become a revelation of the Father's heart. If he will not cast out the coming ones, it is because he came down out of heaven to fulfil the Father's will (see further, vers. 44, 45), to explain the world wide hunger, to meet and execute the will of the Father. The frequent assertions by our Lord in this discourse (and in <a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>) of his descent from heaven as One charged with a full knowledge of the Divine will, implies that the Lord was conscious of pre-existence in the very bosom of God. This was language which, with more of the same import, led St. John to the overwhelming conclusion that the Jesus whom he knew in the flesh was the Only Begotten of the Father - was the Logos made flesh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have come down</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#941;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(katabeb&#275;ka)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2597.htm">Strong's 2597: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go down, come down, either from the sky or from higher land, descend.
