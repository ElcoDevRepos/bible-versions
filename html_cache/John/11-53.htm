The "day" refers to the aftermath of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, an event that significantly increased His following and influence. This miracle, performed in Bethany near Jerusalem, was a direct challenge to the religious leaders' authority. The phrase indicates a turning point where the religious leaders' opposition to Jesus becomes more resolute and organized. Historically, this reflects the growing tension between Jesus and the Jewish authorities, who felt threatened by His teachings and miracles.<p><b>they plotted</b><br>The religious leaders, primarily the Pharisees and the chief priests, are the "they" in this context. Their plotting signifies a deliberate and calculated decision to eliminate Jesus. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, which speaks of rulers conspiring against the Lord's Anointed. The plotting also highlights the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart among the leaders, who, despite witnessing Jesus' miracles, chose to reject Him.<p><b>to kill Him</b><br>The intent to kill Jesus underscores the severity of the threat He posed to the established religious order. This decision to seek His death was not just a political maneuver but also a spiritual battle, as Jesus' mission was to bring salvation and challenge the legalistic and corrupt practices of the time. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who would be "despised and rejected by men." It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice Jesus would make on the cross, fulfilling His role as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, whose teachings and miracles are the foundation of Christian faith.

Some of their number, a small minority, including Joseph of Arimathaea, disapproved of this counsel, and withdrew from their society (<a href="/luke/23-51.htm">Luke 23:51</a>), but the majority overruled the dissidents. This is the very climax of their perversity. They have resolved on the death-penalty. The sentence has been recorded against the Holiest. Priesthood and prophecy have pronounced their final verdict. They have extinguished themselves.
