This division is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the polarizing effect of Jesus' ministry. In the Jewish context, the crowd would have been familiar with the Messianic prophecies, yet their expectations of a political or military Messiah clashed with Jesus' spiritual mission. This division is reminiscent of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>, where the Messiah is described as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, causing many to fall.<p><b>because of Jesus.</b><br>The cause of the division is explicitly linked to Jesus Himself, underscoring His role as a catalyst for decision and belief. Jesus' claims about His identity, such as being the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>) and the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), challenged the religious leaders and the crowd's understanding of God and the Law. This division is not merely a social or political disagreement but a spiritual one, as Jesus' presence and message demand a response. The division also fulfills the prophecy of Simeon in <a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>, where Jesus is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and a sign that will be spoken against.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, whose teachings and identity are causing division among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A diverse group of people gathered in Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles, reacting to Jesus' teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, a significant location for Jewish religious festivals and teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A major Jewish festival during which this division occurs, highlighting the religious and cultural context of the event.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitable_division.htm">The Inevitable Division</a></b><br>Jesus' presence and message often lead to division.

People heard Jesus declare, &#8220;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>), and they reacted with sharp opinions about His identity.<p>&#8226; Scripture presents these reactions as real historical responses, not merely literary devices. The narrative flows directly from earlier conversations on the final day of the Feast of Tabernacles, underscoring that what comes next is an actual consequence of Jesus&#8217; public teaching.<p>&#8226; Cross references show similar cause-and-effect moments: after the Sermon on the Mount, &#8220;the crowds were astonished at His teaching&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>); when He healed on the Sabbath, &#8220;the Pharisees went out and plotted&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-6.htm">Mark 3:6</a>). The word &#8220;So&#8221; signals that kind of immediate aftermath here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there was division</b><p>&#8226; The Greek-speaking world spoke of schismata, literal rifts. Scripture records them plainly: &#8220;There was a division among the Jews because of His words&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-19.htm">John 10:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Division is not an accidental by-product&#8212;it is foretold. Simeon prophesied that Jesus would be &#8220;a sign that will be spoken against&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later confirms that Christ is &#8220;a fragrance of life to some, and of death to others&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15-16</a>). The Word divides truth from error and hearts from hearts (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Bible is inerrant, this report of division is historically accurate and doctrinally significant: those who embrace truth and those who reject it cannot remain neutral.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the crowd</b><p>&#8226; The crowd represents everyday festival-goers, not just leaders. Ordinary people wrestled with extraordinary claims.<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s Gospel often highlights public reaction&#8212;Nicodemus among religious elites (<a href="/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1-2</a>), the Samaritan woman among outcasts (<a href="/john/4-28.htm">John 4:28-30</a>), and here a mixed multitude at a feast.<p>&#8226; Similar scenes appear elsewhere: Jerusalem crowds debated after the Triumphal Entry (<a href="/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10-11</a>), and Antioch&#8217;s whole city gathered to hear Paul, provoking conflict (<a href="/acts/13-44.htm">Acts 13:44-46</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail reminds us that Jesus confronts every tier of society. No one is exempt from deciding what to do with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of Jesus</b><p>&#8226; He Himself is the dividing line. The text assigns no blame to circumstances, politics, or misunderstanding; it squarely says the division was &#8220;because of Jesus.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus predicted this effect: &#8220;Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51-53</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter later affirms that Christ is &#8220;a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7-8</a>), fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>.<p>&#8226; The exclusivity of His claims&#8212;&#8220;I am the way and the truth and the life&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>)&#8212;forces a verdict. His person and work cannot be compartmentalized or relativized.<p>&#8226; The literal record stands: when Jesus is proclaimed as He truly is, division happens, and that division exposes the heart&#8217;s allegiance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/7-43.htm">John 7:43</a> captures a historical moment and an enduring reality: whenever Jesus is declared in truth, people sort themselves in response to Him. The connector &#8220;So&#8221; ties the division directly to His prior words; the phrase &#8220;there was division&#8221; shows the inevitable split between belief and unbelief; &#8220;in the crowd&#8221; underscores that every listener must respond; and &#8220;because of Jesus&#8221; places the cause squarely on the person and claims of Christ. Scripture faithfully records this pattern, reminding today&#8217;s readers that the same Jesus still calls for a decisive response, and the same Word still distinguishes those who receive Him from those who refuse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">There was a division among the people.</span>--The word for division is our word "schism." It is found in the earlier Gospels in one instance only, "the rent is made worse" (<a href="/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.">Matthew 9:16</a>; <a href="/mark/2-21.htm" title="No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.">Mark 2:21</a>). This is nearer to the older meaning of the word, which is used, for example, of the hoofs of animals, and the leaves of trees. St. John uses it only to mark this rent into two parties of the Jewish multitude, here and in <a href="/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>; <a href="/john/10-19.htm" title="There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.">John 10:19</a>. In St. Paul it is used of the divisions of the Church at Corinth (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.">1Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.">1Corinthians 11:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-25.htm" title="That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.">1Corinthians 12:25</a>). The use of the word in its ethical sense may belong in some special way to Ephesus, for only in writings from this city do we find it in Biblical Greek. Later, both the word and the fact denoted by it passed into the history of the Church. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
