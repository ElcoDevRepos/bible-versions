This highlights the power of Jesus' words, which convict the conscience. The law of Moses required witnesses to cast the first stone (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>), but Jesus' challenge exposes their own sinfulness.<p><b>they began to go away one by one</b><br>The gradual departure of the accusers signifies their acknowledgment of personal guilt. This act of leaving one by one suggests a moment of introspection and realization of their own unworthiness to judge. It reflects the broader biblical theme of self-examination before judging others (<a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-5</a>).<p><b>beginning with the older ones</b><br>The older accusers leaving first may indicate their greater awareness of personal sin due to life experience. In biblical culture, elders were respected for their wisdom and judgment (<a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>). Their departure first could symbolize a recognition of their own need for mercy.<p><b>until only Jesus was left</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Jesus' unique sinlessness and authority. As the only one without sin, He alone is qualified to judge. This moment foreshadows His role as the ultimate judge of humanity (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-27</a>) and highlights His divine nature.<p><b>with the woman standing there</b><br>The woman remains, symbolizing her vulnerability and need for grace.

In the emptying courtyard stands the gospel in miniature: every sinner must finally face Jesus alone, and only those who remain before Him receive grace instead of stones.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) The readings of the texts here differ considerably, but without any essential difference of meaning. "Being convicted by their own conscience" is probably an addition made by some copyist to explain the meaning, which is quite clear without it.<p><span class= "bld">Beginning at the eldest.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">beginning at the elders;</span> but our version gives the right sense, and prevents the possible mistake of understanding the word to mean the elders of the people. So "the last" should probably be taken, not of the lowest in official rank, but of the last who went out.<p><span class= "bld">And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span>--The scribes and Pharisees had probably stood close to Him. The woman was at some little distance, naturally shrinking from their gaze; but there is a crowd of people, including the disciples, around her, for they are in the Temple, and before this interruption He was engaged in teaching the people (<a href="/john/8-2.htm" title="And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them.">John 8:2</a>). Her accusers had "set her in the midst" (<a href="/john/8-2.htm" title="And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them.">John 8:2</a>), where she now stands. The whole scene is pictured with the minute detail of an eye-witness, who remembers how the persons were grouped, how the accusers went out one after another, and then, how Jesus was left alone, apart from the crowd, but that the others were still present.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they when they heard it</span> (<span class="cmt_word">being convicted by</span> <span class="cmt_word">their</span> <span class="cmt_word">own</span> <span class="cmt_word">conscience</span>), <span class="cmt_word">they went out one by one.</span> Their conscience convinced them that the spirit of the Law is greater than its letter. The phrase expressing the action of conscience was probably an explanatory and true gloss, which accounted for the sudden change of front. It was a proof of the ally which Divine law has within the human breast. The whole crowd, rather than the humbled woman, is condemned, but self-condemned and silent. This event speaks for the moral sense which had been paralyzed rather than obliterated in this people. (The expression, "one by one," <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c2;</span>, in which <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c2;</span> is treated as indeclinable, is occasionally found in later Greek, but only once in the New Testament (<a href="/mark/14-19.htm">Mark 14:19</a>), is not in D, but in several of the codices and cursives, and it is retained in R.T.) The slow rather than simultaneous disappearance of the gang of accusers is a highly dramatic touch, and the remaining clause, <span class="cmt_word">beginning from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the eldest, even unto the last,</span> heightens the impression. The phrase <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> need not refer to office, but to age, and the "last" need not necessarily mean the youngest, but those that were left when the most responsible men found that they had carried their question too far, and had retired. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus was left alone</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so far as these accusers were concerned. The multitudes who had gathered round him were still waiting for his words (see ver. 2). This fact is involved in the substance of the narrative, whether the <span class="accented">pericope</span> belongs to the Gospel of John or not. And <span class="cmt_word">the woman where she was,</span> <span class="cmt_word">in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the midst</span> of the assembly that remained, more likely cowering in shame and mortal fear than standing brazen-faced or daring before that awful Presence. These two ("Miseria et Misericordia," as said Augustine), "Misery and Pity," face one another, and in the presence of a multitude of disciples and other listeners, Misery waits for Pity to speak - for perfect holiness and perfect mercy to do its will. There is One seated there who <span class="accented">is</span> without sin.
