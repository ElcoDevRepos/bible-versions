It reflects Jesus' genuine human concern and empathy, as He seeks to engage with the mourners and understand the situation. The question also demonstrates His willingness to be involved in the lives of those He loves. In biblical context, this moment is significant as it precedes one of Jesus' most profound miracles, the raising of Lazarus from the dead. This question can be seen as a precursor to the revelation of His divine power over life and death. It echoes the human experience of loss and the search for understanding in times of grief.<p><b>He asked.</b><br>The act of asking shows Jesus' relational nature and His approachability. It highlights His role as a teacher who often used questions to engage with people and lead them to deeper truths. This method is consistent with His teaching style throughout the Gospels, where He often asked questions to provoke thought and reflection. It also underscores His humility, as He does not assume knowledge but seeks to connect with those around Him.<p><b>&#8220;Come and see, Lord,&#8221; they answered.</b><br>The response of the people reflects their respect and recognition of Jesus' authority, as they address Him as "Lord." This title acknowledges His position and the faith they have in Him, even in the midst of their sorrow. The invitation to "come and see" is reminiscent of other biblical invitations to witness God's work, such as in <a href="/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5</a>, "Come and see what God has done." It also foreshadows the invitation to the disciples in <a href="/john/1-39.htm">John 1:39</a>, where Jesus says, "Come and you will see." This phrase invites Jesus into their grief, showing their openness to His presence and intervention. It sets the stage for the miraculous event that follows, where Jesus will demonstrate His power over death, affirming His identity as the resurrection and the life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God who demonstrates His divine authority and compassion throughout the events of <a href="/bsb/john/11.htm">John 11</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>The brother of Mary and Martha, Lazarus has died, and his resurrection by Jesus is the focal miracle of this chapter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_and_martha.htm">Mary and Martha</a></b><br>Sisters of Lazarus, they are deeply grieving his death and are significant figures in the account, showcasing faith and human emotion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>The village where Lazarus, Mary, and Martha lived, located near Jerusalem.

His question is practical, yet packed with compassion.<p>&#8226; Just as the Lord asked Adam, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>, here He seeks relationship rather than information. He already knows, yet He invites them to participate in the unfolding miracle.<p>&#8226; This question highlights Christ&#8217;s personal involvement in human sorrow, echoing <a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>: &#8220;In all their affliction, He was afflicted.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s interest in the location of the tomb signals His intention to confront death directly, prefiguring His own resurrection (<a href="/john/20-6.htm">John 20:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He asked</b><p>&#8220;He asked&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-34.htm">John 11:34</a>b)<p>&#8226; The eternal Word (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>) humbly asks&#8212;a stunning blend of deity and humanity.<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear when Jesus inquired, &#8220;Who touched My garments?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30</a>) or &#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-5.htm">Mark 8:5</a>). Each question draws faith to the surface.<p>&#8226; By asking, He models compassionate listening (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>) and shows us that genuine ministry begins with understanding the need.<p>&#8226; His question also sets the stage for eyewitness verification; no one could later claim that Lazarus was alive all along (<a href="/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39&#8211;40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come and see, Lord</b><p>&#8220;Come and see, Lord,&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-34.htm">John 11:34</a>c)<p>&#8226; The mourners echo the words first spoken to Jesus by would-be disciples: &#8220;Come and see&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-39.htm">John 1:39</a>). What began as an invitation to fellowship now becomes an invitation to confront death.<p>&#8226; Their address, &#8220;Lord,&#8221; acknowledges His authority (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>). Even in sorrow they voice trust.<p>&#8226; This simple response illustrates active faith: they do not merely tell Him where the tomb is; they escort Him there, much like Jairus leading Jesus to his dying daughter (<a href="/mark/5-22.htm">Mark 5:22-24</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a> urges, &#8220;Taste and see that the LORD is good.&#8221; These mourners will soon &#8220;see&#8221; His goodness in a breathtaking way.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they answered</b><p>&#8220;they answered.&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-34.htm">John 11:34</a>d)<p>&#8226; A communal reply underscores that many witnesses were present, fulfilling the legal standard of <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a> for confirmed testimony.<p>&#8226; Their response demonstrates unity in grief and in expectation; together they give Jesus access to the tomb, paving the way for a shared experience of His power (<a href="/john/11-45.htm">John 11:45</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that Christ&#8217;s miracles are never performed in a vacuum; they are public signs meant to stir belief (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/11-34.htm">John 11:34</a> captures a tender exchange where the Lord of life steps into the darkest human moment&#8212;death. His question shows involvement, His asking displays humility, the invitation &#8220;Come and see&#8221; reflects trust, and the collective answer provides a platform for undeniable witness.
