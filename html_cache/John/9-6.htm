It also connects to the broader theme in John of Jesus as the Light of the World, bringing spiritual and physical sight.<p><b>He spit on the ground</b><br>Spitting on the ground to make mud was a common practice in ancient times, believed to have medicinal properties.

It also prefigures the new creation that believers experience through faith in Christ.<p><b>and applied it to the man&#8217;s eyes</b><br>By applying the mud to the man's eyes, Jesus engages in a personal and intimate act of healing. This physical touch signifies compassion and the breaking of social norms, as touching a blind person or using saliva was considered unclean. It also foreshadows the sacramental nature of Jesus' ministry, where physical elements are used to convey spiritual truths and grace.

The marginal rendering, <span class= "ital">and He spread the clay upon the eyes of the blind man</span> (or, <span class= "ital">upon his eyes</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> is to be preferred.<p>The details given in this and the next verse are evidently to be regarded as part of the sign. They impressed themselves as such upon the eye-witnesses, and they have been recorded as such for us. We have then to seek their interpretation. At the outset we are met by the undoubted fact that our Lord here made use of means which, in part at least, were natural, and found their place in the ordinary prescriptions of the day. We know from the pages of Pliny, and Tacitus, and Suetonius, that the <span class= "ital">saliva jejuna</span> was held to be a remedy in cases of blindness, and that the same remedy was used by the Jews is established by the writings of the Rabbis. That clay was so used is not equally certain, but this may be regarded as the vehicle by means of which the saliva was applied. Here, then, as elsewhere, we may recognise the Divine manifested by means of the human, and see the ordinary remedy of every-day life blessed to meet a case that was beyond human power. Physicians had applied such means commonly to cases of post-natal blindness, but congenital blindness had always been regarded as incurable, and no instance to the contrary had ever been heard of (<a href="/john/9-32.htm" title="Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.">John 9:32</a>). The Great Physician, then, by using the ordinary means, will teach men that the healing powers of nature are His gracious gift, and that they are increased at the Giver's will. Our daily sustenance in health and strength, our restored power after sickness or accident, the whole of ordinary life, which we too commonly connect only with ordinary means, is lifted to the higher region of union with Him in whom we live, and move, and have our being.<p>Another interpretation sees in the use of clay a symbolism which is to be traced to the first Creation, when man was formed from the dust of the earth. We find this as early as Irenaeus, and it may well, therefore, represent an oral explanation, going back to the days of the Evangelist himself. The thought would be that our Lord will here exercise the same creative power as that which made man, and will complete, by the gift of sight, this man, who had hitherto been maimed and without the chief organ of sense.<p>The use of means by which the healing power is conveyed is common to this instance with that of the blind man at Bethsaida (<a href="/context/mark/8-22.htm" title="And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man to him, and sought him to touch him.">Mark 8:22-26</a>), and that of the deaf and dumb man in Decapolis (<a href="/context/mark/7-32.htm" title="And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand on him.">Mark 7:32-37</a>); while the two blind men in the house (<a href="/context/matthew/9-27.htm" title="And when Jesus departed there, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, You son of David, have mercy on us.">Matthew 9:27-31</a>), and the two blind men at Jericho (<a href="/context/matthew/20-29.htm" title="And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.">Matthew 20:29-34</a>), are touched and receive their sight. The reader is referred to the Notes on these passages of St. Matthew and St. Mark. Here it will be enough to observe that in each case the loss of a channel of communication between the individual man and the outer world is compensated by some special means which may help to assure him of the presence of the true Healer, and may furnish a foundation for his faith and hope. The deaf man cannot hear the tones of a voice that tells of mercy and love, but the touch applied to the ear may in part convey the same gracious truths. The blind man cannot see the look of compassion which others can see, but the saliva or the clay applied to the eye gives force to the word which is heard by the ear. In every case we should remember that the means is chiefly moral, preparing in the sufferer a mental condition which can receive the gift of healing, and that the physical gift is itself regarded as a stage in the spiritual education. The wisest physicians of the body, and the wisest physicians of the soul, have alike sought to follow in the steps of Him who is their common Master. There are conditions of physical disease for which the truest medicines would be faith, and love, and hope--a mind at peace with itself and with God. There are morbid states of spiritual life that have their cause in physical derangement, and would find their truest remedy in the healthy tone of a restored and vigorous body. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and with the</span> <span class="cmt_word">clay thereof anointed his</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">eyes</span> (of the blind man). The precise meaning and motive of the process here described has been a source of great perplexity to the commentators. We see that, on other occasions, our Lord used his own saliva as a means of cure (<a href="/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>; <a href="/mark/8-23.htm">Mark 8:23</a>). Theme finds in the spittle the symbol of the impurity of the man thus dealt with (<a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5, 6</a>), but somewhat inconsistently compares the "clay" with the "collyrium" of <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17-19</a>, and the "ausfiuss des Logos." On some occasions Jesus touched the diseased or deficient organ, put his hand on the leper, and his fingers in the ears of the deaf mute. On other occasions, again, he healed with his word only, and even from a distance, those who. in the freeness and royalty of his love, he elected to relieve from their sufferings. He was moved, doubtless, in every case by the 'special condition and temperament of the objects of his compassion. The use of these means was probably intended to evoke the nascent faith that predisposed him to receive healing, to stir the mind of the sufferer into some conscious relation will himself through those other powers of tactile sensitiveness which were in all similar cases singularly acute. Moreover, the virtue of saliva in cases of blindness was well understood. Lightfoot gives some curious proof of this, and Tacitus ('Hist.,' 4:81) and Suetonius ('Vesp.,' <a href="/john/7.htm">John 7</a>.) both record the healing of a blind man by the Emperor Vespasian by the use of <span class="accented">jejuna saliva</span>. Pliny (' Hist. Nat.,' 28:7) speaks of the same remedy for the diseases of the eye. "Clay" also is spoken of as being sanative by a physician by name <span class="accented">Serenus Samonicus]PGBR> (see Tholuck, Wetistein, Lange, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). These ideas may have had some truth in them, and for the blind man to find the process described, applied to himself by One who spoke of the Divine operations being wrought in him, would work some powerful effect on his moral, physical, and spiritual nature. Such result our Lord intended to produce. But this was only part of the healing process. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When [Jesus] had said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eip&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
