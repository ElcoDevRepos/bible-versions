The Jews often questioned Jesus' statements, reflecting their skepticism and misunderstanding of His spiritual teachings. This questioning attitude is seen throughout the Gospels, where the Jewish leaders frequently challenge Jesus' authority and teachings.<p><b>&#8220;Will He kill Himself,</b><br>The Jews' question reveals their misunderstanding of Jesus' statement about His departure. In Jewish culture, suicide was considered a grave sin, and the suggestion that Jesus might kill Himself shows their confusion and perhaps a degree of mockery. This reflects their inability to grasp the spiritual nature of Jesus' mission and His reference to His eventual crucifixion and ascension.<p><b>since He says,</b><br>This part of the phrase indicates that their question is a direct response to Jesus' previous statement. It shows their attempt to interpret His words literally rather than spiritually. Jesus often spoke in parables and metaphors, which required spiritual insight to understand.<p><b>&#8216;Where I am going,</b><br>Jesus is referring to His return to the Father, a theme He frequently mentions in the Gospel of John. This statement points to His divine origin and destiny, emphasizing His unique relationship with God the Father. It also foreshadows His death, resurrection, and ascension.<p><b>you cannot come&#8217;?</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual separation between Jesus and those who do not believe in Him. It underscores the idea that access to the Father is only possible through Jesus. This echoes <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life.

Where I am going, you cannot come&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-21.htm">John 8:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Hearing that, the crowd is puzzled. Earlier they had wondered, &#8220;Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him?&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-35.htm">John 7:35</a>). Their continued confusion shows how far their thoughts are from Jesus&#8217; heavenly mission.<p>&#8226; Scripture often notes this pattern of misunderstanding whenever hearts are hardened (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>). The question they raise exposes spiritual blindness rather than honest seeking.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will He kill Himself, since He says,</b><p>&#8226; Their first guess is shocking: &#8220;Will He kill Himself?&#8221; They leap to a dark conclusion because they cannot fathom any other destination outside their earthly frame of reference.<p>&#8226; The irony is thick. Jesus will indeed &#8220;lay down His life of His own accord&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>), but not in despair. He will offer Himself as the spotless Lamb (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>) and rise again (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture treats self-murder as the tragic end of those in desperation (<a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>; <a href="/acts/16-27.htm">Acts 16:27</a>). Jesus&#8217; sacrifice, by contrast, is an act of obedience and love (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Their flawed assumption underlines their lack of revelation; &#8220;the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Where I am going, you cannot come&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; Jesus speaks of returning to the Father, the glory He shared &#8220;before the world existed&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>).

The promise becomes true for every believer (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; For Jesus&#8217; hostile listeners, the statement is a solemn warning; apart from repentance, they will never share His eternal home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The crowd&#8217;s cynical question reveals spiritual blindness, not curiosity. Jesus is not plotting suicide; He is preparing the cross, resurrection, and ascension. His words spotlight a stark divide: unbelief keeps sinners from God&#8217;s presence, while faith in the crucified and risen Christ opens the way to follow Him where He is going.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself?</span>--They see the deeper meaning of His words, and yet cannot see how that meaning is to be fulfilled. "He is going away, and He clearly refers to His death. But the issues of life are in the darkness of the future. Who can know the hour of His own departure? There is only one class of persons who can speak with certainty of thus going away, and these are persons who by their own act fix the limit of their own lives."<p><span class= "bld">Because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>. Then they had asked in scorn if He would go to the Dispersion and teach the heathen? If so, they certainly could not follow Him. Here there is the same scorn. If He intends to go to Hades, He will indeed be beyond their reach. They expect to go to Abraham's bosom: between Him and them there will be the great gulf which no one can pass. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/luke/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;">Luke 16:22-26</a>.) Many expositors have seen here a reference to the deeper darkness which, in current Jewish belief, fell on the souls of those who had by their own act passed to the other world. This is supported by the speech of Josephus at Jotapata (<span class= "ital">Wars, </span>iii. 8, ? 5). Their words may imply, "If He is going to that depth, well may He say 'Whither I go, ye cannot come.'" But if this meaning were expressed in their words, we should have expected some reference to it in the answer of our Lord; and if it be expressed at all it is in <span class= "ital">their</span> words. It has no sanction in thought or word from Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore said</span> (were saying one to the other), <span class="cmt_word">Will he kill himself, that</span> (because) <span class="cmt_word">he saith, Whither I go, thither ye cannot come?</span> This query was one of harsh mockery, and can hardly be exaggerated in malign intent. The suicide was supposed to have his place in Gehenna, According to Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:08. 5), "the darkest regions of Hades would receive the souls of such." The Jews then scoff at his departure as a spontaneous resort to a fate towards which they did rot care or mean to follow him. Edersheim declares this passage of Josephus not to be sustained by rabbinical authority, and he doubts this aspect of their scorn. He limits it to the Jewish guess that Jesus must be contemplating self. murder, and as putting deliberately such a distance between them and him that they could not traverse it. The very fact that they had it in their hearts to destroy him makes it probable that they were looking beyond the act of suicide, either to the hell of popular belief or the hatred of contemporaries. They obviously thought that none but a suicide can determine the time of his departure. Christ proceeded to show them that the reason why his death would separate them from him was a fundamental difference of nature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
