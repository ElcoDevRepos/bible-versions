The concept of being "born again" was foreign to Jewish thought, which emphasized physical lineage and adherence to the Law. Nicodemus's question reflects a literal interpretation, common in Jewish teaching, where age and wisdom were highly valued. His confusion highlights the radical nature of Jesus' teaching on spiritual rebirth, which transcends physical age and human understanding.<p><b>Nicodemus asked.</b><br>Nicodemus is a significant figure, representing the religious elite of Israel. His approach to Jesus at night suggests a cautious curiosity, possibly due to fear of being seen with Jesus, who was controversial among the Pharisees. This encounter is unique to the Gospel of John, which often emphasizes themes of light and darkness, both literal and metaphorical. Nicodemus's role in later passages, such as defending Jesus (<a href="/john/7-50.htm">John 7:50-51</a>) and assisting in His burial (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>), indicates a progression in his understanding and faith.<p><b>&#8220;Can he enter his mother&#8217;s womb a second time to be born?&#8221;</b><br>This question underscores Nicodemus's literal interpretation of Jesus' statement about being "born again." The imagery of re-entering the womb is intentionally absurd, highlighting the impossibility of physical rebirth. This reflects a common teaching method in Jewish culture, where hyperbolic questions were used to provoke deeper thought. Jesus' response in the following verses clarifies that He speaks of a spiritual rebirth, a transformation brought about by the Holy Spirit. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>, which speaks of a new heart and spirit, and <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, which describes believers as new creations in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nicodemus.htm">Nicodemus</a></b><br>A Pharisee and a member of the Jewish ruling council, the Sanhedrin.

What seems impossible to man becomes gloriously possible through the saving power of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">How can a man be born . . .?</span>--Nicodemus understands the words "born again" in the sense given above. The thought is not wholly strange to him. The Rabbis were accustomed to speak of proselytes as children, and the term "new creature" (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>) was in frequent use to express the call of Abraham. But he is himself a child of Abraham, a member of the theocratic kingdom, and is expecting the glory of Messiah's reign. He is a teacher of the Law, a ruler of the chosen people. He is not as a heathen who can be born into the holy nation. The ordinary spiritual sense of the words cannot hold in his case. What can they mean? He does not wilfully misinterpret, for this is opposed to the whole character of the man, nor does he really suppose the physical meaning is intended; but after the method of Rabbinic dialogue, he presses the impossible meaning of the words in order to exclude it, and to draw forth the true meaning. "You cannot mean that a man is to enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born. What is it, then, that you do mean?"<p><span class= "bld">When he is old</span> does not necessarily apply to Nicodemus himself. It is the most difficult special case coming under the general term, "a man." In Philo's artificial division of the lifetime, based on that of Hippocrates, the "old man" (<span class= "greekheb">?????</span>) is one more than fifty-six years (<span class= "ital">De Mund. Opif.</span> ? 36). If we understand this of Nicodemus personally, it will make the identification with Nak'dimon (Note on <a href="/john/3-1.htm" title="There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:">John 3:1</a>) barely possible.<p>(4) The proper meaning of the word rendered "sound" (<span class= "greekheb">????</span>) is articulate "voice." It is used in fifteen passages in this Gospel only, and everywhere translated "voice" except here. Let the reader substitute the one meaning for the other in any of these passages, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/john/1-23.htm" title="He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.">John 1:23</a>; <a href="/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>; <a href="/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a>; <a href="/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,">John 5:28</a>; <a href="/context/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3-5</a>; <a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>, and he will find that they are not interchangeable. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nicodemus saith</span> <span class="cmt_word">to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</span> The numerous endeavours to interpret the motive or mind of Nicodemus show almost as much misunderstanding of the <span class="accented">naivete</span> of his amazement, as Nicodemus did of the deepest significance of this solemn utterance of the Lord. Two things are perfectly clear: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Nicodemus saw a grave and amazing difficulty in the idea of a second birth of a man old, like himself, in years, prepossessions, habits of thought, ways of acting, social ties, ancestral and traditional customs, and in venerable ideas consecrated by long usage. He might have known the language of the prophets concerning circumcision of heart (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>) and concerning a <span class="accented">new heart</span> and right spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26, 27</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-4.htm">Psalm 86:4</a>); but the full bearing of these prophetic ideas were beyond and different to the almost drastic form of Christ's call for spiritual change and "birth from the beginning." There is no necessity for us to accuse him either of "narrowness" (Meyer) or of imbecility (Reuss, Lucke), or to make such a charge react upon the spirit or temper of the evangelist in delineating him. It is enough that Nicodemus should have seen a grave difficulty; and Thoma here is justified in referring to the language of the apostles, when the narrow entrance into the kingdom was set forth under the image of the camel and the needle's eye; and to Mary, when she cried, "How can this thing be?" Moreover, the same perplexity, after eighteen hundred years of Christian experience, still encumbers this utterance of the Master. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Nicodemus did not, by the form of his question, put such query to the Lord in any literal baldness or insolent worldliness. Surely such a view ignores all the tropical methods of speech current in the rabbinical schools. He virtually said," Birth such as you speak of is as impossible as the second physical birth of an old man, as preposterous as would be re-entrance into the womb of his mother for the purpose of a second birth." Christ had spoken of a fundamental change - one going right down to the very sources and beginnings of life. The Lord had used this difficult image, and propounded his view in a term capable of various interpretation. Nicodemus simply expresses his alarm and incredulity in terms of the image itself. It is little more than the language of the prophet, "Can an Ethiopian change his skin, or a leopard his spots?" Are you not proposing a natural impessibility? Must not the kingdom of God, which we thought we saw in thy advent and mighty deeds, be on this understanding hopelessly veiled from human vision? The "being old" shows that Nicodemus had gone through the metaphor to the condition of mind of which it was the subject. There was no greater physical difficulty in an old man re-entering his mother's womb than for a boy of twelve to do so; but being probably, not necessarily, an old man, and belonging to a society of grave, reverend elders, with the inveterate habits, practices, traditions, of long lives behind them, how impracticable and impossible does the notion of so complete a change appear to him! Hence his question. Westcott says admirably, "The great mystery of religion is not the punishment, but the forgiveness of sins; not the natural permanence of character, but spiritual regeneration." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;How</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#8182;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(P&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4459.htm">Strong's 4459: </a> </span><span class="str2">Adverb from the base of pou; an interrogative particle of manner; in what way?; also as exclamation, how much!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(dynatai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1410.htm">Strong's 1410: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I am powerful, have (the) power, (b) I am able, I can.
