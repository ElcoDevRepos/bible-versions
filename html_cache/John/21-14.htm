The first appearance was to Mary Magdalene and the other women (<a href="/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11-18</a>), and the second was to the disciples without Thomas present (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19-23</a>). The third appearance, as noted here, emphasizes the reality and consistency of Jesus' resurrection, reinforcing the truth of His victory over death. The number three often signifies completeness or divine perfection in biblical numerology, underscoring the fulfillment of Jesus' promises.<p><b>that Jesus appeared to the disciples</b><br>The appearances of Jesus to His disciples were crucial for establishing their faith and commissioning them for their future ministry. These encounters provided undeniable evidence of His resurrection, which was foundational for the early church's proclamation of the gospel. The term "appeared" suggests a physical manifestation, countering any claims that the resurrection was merely spiritual or metaphorical. This physicality is essential for the doctrine of the bodily resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian belief.<p><b>after He was raised from the dead</b><br>This phrase affirms the central Christian doctrine of the resurrection. Jesus' resurrection is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which foretold the Messiah's victory over death. The resurrection is also a type of the future resurrection of believers, as Paul explains in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-23</a>. It signifies the defeat of sin and death, offering hope and assurance of eternal life to all who believe. The historical reality of the resurrection is supported by multiple eyewitness accounts and is a pivotal event that transformed the disciples from fearful followers into bold proclaimers of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who appears to His disciples, affirming His victory over death and His divine nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are witnesses to His resurrection and are being prepared for their mission to spread the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_tiberias.htm">Sea of Tiberias</a></b><br>The location where Jesus appears to His disciples, also known as the Sea of Galilee, a significant place in Jesus' ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead, confirming His power over death and His identity as the Son of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/third_appearance.htm">Third Appearance</a></b><br>This specific appearance is noted as the third time Jesus shows Himself to His disciples after His resurrection, emphasizing the reality and consistency of His risen presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Reality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The repeated appearances of Jesus to His disciples underscore the truth of His resurrection, which is central to Christian faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_faithfulness.htm">Jesus' Faithfulness</a></b><br>By appearing multiple times, Jesus demonstrates His commitment to His disciples, reassuring them and preparing them for their mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_witness.htm">The Importance of Witness</a></b><br>The disciples' role as witnesses to the resurrection is crucial for the spread of the Gospel; believers today are also called to testify to the risen Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_doubt.htm">Encouragement in Doubt</a></b><br>Just as Jesus appeared to His disciples in their uncertainty, He meets us in our doubts and strengthens our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_mission.htm">Preparation for Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' appearances serve to equip and empower His disciples for the task ahead, reminding us of the importance of being prepared for our own callings.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_21_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 21:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_21_14_s_role_in_affirming_resurrection.htm">How does John 21:14 affirm Jesus' resurrection and its importance for believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_faithfulness_in_John_21_14.htm">What does Jesus' third appearance in John 21:14 teach about His faithfulness?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_disciples_recognition_daily.htm">How can we apply the disciples' recognition of Jesus to our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_21_14_to_other_Gospel_accounts.htm">How does John 21:14 connect with other resurrection accounts in the Gospels?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_deepen_belief_in_Jesus_resurrection.htm">What steps can we take to strengthen our belief in Jesus' resurrection today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jesus_appear_again_in_John_21_14.htm">Why did Jesus appear to His disciples a third time in John 21:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Jesus_3rd_appearance.htm">What significance does the third appearance of Jesus hold in John 21:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_21_14_s_role_in_Jesus_resurrection.htm">How does John 21:14 affirm the resurrection of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_john_denying_being_elijah_a_contradiction.htm">In Matthew 11:14, Jesus identifies John as Elijah, but John 1:21 records John denying this.

That there were other manifestations is not obscurely hinted by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;</span>.
