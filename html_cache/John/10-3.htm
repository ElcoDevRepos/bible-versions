This imagery highlights the role of divine authority and order. The gatekeeper can be seen as a representation of God the Father, who grants Jesus, the Good Shepherd, access to His flock. This aligns with the biblical theme of Jesus being the only legitimate way to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The gatekeeper's role underscores the legitimacy and divine approval of Jesus' ministry.<p><b>and the sheep listen for his voice</b><br>Sheep are known for their ability to recognize the voice of their shepherd, distinguishing it from others. This phrase emphasizes the intimate relationship between Jesus and His followers, who are attuned to His teachings and guidance. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the call for believers to discern and follow the voice of truth amidst the many voices in the world (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>). The ability to hear and respond to Jesus' voice is a mark of true discipleship.<p><b>He calls his own sheep by name</b><br>This phrase illustrates the personal and individual care Jesus has for each of His followers. In biblical times, shepherds often named their sheep, indicating a deep familiarity and bond. This personal calling signifies the intimate relationship Jesus desires with each believer, echoing the theme of God's personal knowledge and care for His people (<a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>). It also reflects the prophetic fulfillment of the Messiah as a shepherd who knows His flock intimately (<a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>).<p><b>and leads them out</b><br>The act of leading the sheep out signifies guidance and provision. In the historical context, shepherds would lead their sheep to pastures for nourishment and safety. This imagery is a metaphor for Jesus leading His followers to spiritual sustenance and protection. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of God as a shepherd leading His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>. This leadership is not coercive but invitational, reflecting Jesus' role as a guide and protector who leads His followers to abundant life (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gatekeeper.htm">The Gatekeeper</a></b><br>Represents God or the Holy Spirit, who opens the way for Jesus, the Good Shepherd, to enter and lead His flock.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shepherd.htm">The Shepherd</a></b><br>Jesus Christ, who is the Good Shepherd, knows His sheep personally and leads them with care and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep.htm">The Sheep</a></b><br>Believers who recognize and follow the voice of Jesus, indicating a personal relationship with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheepfold.htm">The Sheepfold</a></b><br>Symbolizes the community of believers or the Church, where the sheep are gathered and protected.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice.htm">The Voice</a></b><br>Represents the teachings and guidance of Jesus, which the sheep recognize and follow.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_the_shepherd's_voice.htm">Recognizing the Shepherd's Voice</a></b><br>Believers are called to discern and follow the voice of Jesus amidst the many voices in the world.

There is no further interpretation of what, in the spiritual fold, corresponds to the office of the porter, whereas the door and the shepherd are successively made the texts of fuller expositions of Christ's own work. We are not, therefore, to regard "the porter" as an essential part of the allegory (comp. <a href="/john/10-5.htm" title="And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.">John 10:5</a>), nor need we trouble ourselves with the various expositions which have been given of it. At the same time, we should not forget that the thought is one which impressed itself on the mind of St. Paul. At Ephesus "a great and effectual door was opened unto him" (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm" title="For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.">1Corinthians 16:9</a>); "when he came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel a door was opened unto him of the Lord" (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>); the Colossians are exhorted to pray that "a door of the word (the gospel) may be opened, to speak the mystery of Christ" (<a href="/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>); at the close of the first missionary journey he and Barnabas told how "God had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles" (<a href="/acts/14-27.htm" title="And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.">Acts 14:27</a>). We have St. Paul's authority, therefore, for understanding by the "door-keeper," if we are to interpret it here, the Holy Spirit, whose special work it is to determine who are shepherds and sheep, and to call each to the work and position given to him by God. We must be careful to note, with this interpretation, that St. Paul gives divine titles to Him who thus opens the door, lest, from the humble position of the porter in the material fold, we should be led to unworthy thoughts of Him who is "neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding."<p><span class= "bld">And the sheep hear his voice.</span>--The reference is here to the whole of the sheep in the fold; they are all roused as they hear a shepherd's cry, which is the signal for their being led forth to the pastures. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To him the porter openeth</span>. The doorkeeper of the fold has been variously interpreted. Bengel and Hengstenberg say, "God himself" is meant; Stier, Alford, and Lange, "the Holy Spirit;" against which interpretations may be urged the subordinate position assigned to the "porter," as compared with the shepherds themselves. Lampe and Godet think that "John the Baptist" was intended; while Meyer and De Wette say that it is one of those elements of the parable which is dropped out of our Lord's own exposition for which we need not seek any special application. Westcott thinks it must vary with the special sense attributed to "sheep" and "shepherd," and float we must think of it as "the Spirit working through his appointed ministers in each case." The "doorkeeper," if Christ be himself the "Door," is the keeper of that door - the agency, the ministry, the ordinances by which the excellences and power of Christ were or are manifested. We are reminded of subsequent use of the imagery in Paul's Epistles (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; cf. <a href="/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>); but the full meaning of the phrase is only suggested, and we had better wait for Christ's interpretation of some parts of this allegory. The context provides a specific filling out, first of one part of the imagery, and secondly of another part of it. The two interpretations are not to be forced at one and the same time upon the parable. Our Lord continues: <span class="cmt_word">And the sheep hear his</span> <span class="cmt_word">voice</span>. When a shepherd approaches the door to fetch the folded sheep which belong to him, the porter opens that door for him <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a true shepherd who has at heart the interests of the sheep and of their supreme Owner, finds the way made ready for him. In the fold are many flocks. All the sheep give heed to his voice. <span class="cmt_word">He calleth</span> <span class="cmt_word">his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</span> They know a shepherd calls, and then that shepherd addresses his own sheep by name, and he leads these forth into the pasture. Even in our own pastures the shepherds know each sheep by name. Aristotle ('Hist. Anim.,' 6:19) tells us the bell-wether knew his name, and obeyed his shepherd. Archdeacon Watkins gives a quotation from Theocritus' 'Idylls,' charmingly illustrating the habit. The shepherd, by the mere call to his own sheep, would separate them from these which did not belong to him, and lead them forth to their pasture in the wilderness. This method of Oriental life illustrates the function of all true shepherds of men. It has had many partial fulfillments in the history of the Church and of the world. Daring the period of the old theocratic dispensation, many "thieves and robbers" made havoc of the flock; still there were prophetic and kingly men who, sent by God, found their way to the heart of Israel; many came to know that a prophet had been among them, and they followed him. It is equally true now, though all the external conditions are changed. The full application of this part of the allegory is only seen when "the good Shepherd" seeketh his sheep; but the meaning of the first picture is obscured by hurrying on to the enlarged and double exposition which Christ gave of the two parts of his own parable, and much is lost by endeavoring to force into a primary exposition of vers. 1-6 the features borrowed from a twofold interpretation of the separate ideas suggested by the composite image. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
