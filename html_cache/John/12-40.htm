It echoes <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where God commissions Isaiah to deliver a message that will harden the hearts of the people. This blinding is not arbitrary but a response to persistent unbelief. In the New Testament, this concept is seen in <a href="/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8</a>, where Paul speaks of a "spirit of stupor" given to Israel. The blinding serves as a judicial act, emphasizing the seriousness of rejecting God's revelation.<p><b>and hardened their hearts</b><br>The hardening of hearts is a recurring biblical theme, notably seen in Pharaoh's resistance to Moses in Exodus. This hardening is both a divine act and a human choice, illustrating the tension between God's sovereignty and human responsibility. In the context of <a href="/john/12.htm">John 12</a>, it highlights the Jewish leaders' refusal to accept Jesus as the Messiah despite witnessing His miracles. This hardening fulfills prophecy and serves as a warning against the dangers of unbelief.<p><b>so that they cannot see with their eyes</b><br>This phrase underscores the spiritual incapacity to perceive truth. It is not a physical blindness but a metaphorical one, where individuals are unable to recognize Jesus' identity and mission. This inability is a consequence of the hardening process, illustrating the tragic outcome of rejecting divine revelation. The inability to "see" is a common motif in the Gospels, where spiritual insight is contrasted with physical sight.<p><b>and understand with their hearts</b><br>Understanding with the heart implies a deep, inner comprehension that goes beyond intellectual assent. In Hebrew thought, the heart is the center of will and emotion. The lack of understanding signifies a failure to grasp the spiritual truths about Jesus and His kingdom. This phrase connects to the parables of Jesus, where understanding is granted to those who are open to His message (<a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>).<p><b>and turn</b><br>Turning, or repentance, is a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments. It involves a change of mind and direction, moving away from sin and towards God. The call to turn is a call to repentance, which is necessary for salvation. In the context of <a href="/john/12.htm">John 12</a>, the lack of turning is a result of spiritual blindness and hardening, preventing the people from experiencing the fullness of God's grace.<p><b>and I would heal them</b><br>Healing here is symbolic of spiritual restoration and salvation. It reflects God's desire to restore those who turn to Him in repentance. This healing is not just physical but encompasses the whole being, offering forgiveness and reconciliation with God. The promise of healing is a consistent biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, where God's willingness to heal is contingent upon repentance and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of John, whose teachings and miracles are the focus of the account.

Our Lord, as we have seen, quotes them as explaining His own teaching (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm" title="And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:">Matthew 13:14</a>); St. John quotes them here to explain the rejection of that teaching; St. Paul quotes them in <a href="/acts/28-26.htm" title="Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:">Acts 28:26</a>, to explain the rejection of the Gospel by the Jews at Rome. Yet we are to remember that the prophet and those who quote him are all witnesses that within Israel there were eyes which were not blinded and hearts which were not hardened. Isaiah, and John, and Paul, were all Jews; and our Lord Himself was, in His human nature, of the seed of Abraham. Isaiah's prophecy is accompanied by the promise of a holy seed (<a href="/john/12-13.htm" title="Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.">John 12:13</a>); St. John quotes these words, and adds that "even of the rulers many believed" (<a href="/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>); St. Paul quotes them when "some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not" (<a href="/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24</a>); our Lord quotes them, and immediately says, "But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear." There is, indeed, a judicial blinding and a judicial hardening--let no man therefore presume; but these come only to eyes that will not to see, and to hearts that will not to hear--let no man therefore despair. The quotation in this place does not follow exactly either the Hebrew or the Greek of the passage in Isaiah. In the Hebrew text, as in the Authorised version, the prophet is commanded to "make the heart of this people fat." . . . The Greek text says simply, "The heart of this people was hardened." . . . St. John represents the action which God commanded to be done as done by Himself, and speaks of it in the past tense.<p><span class= "bld">And I should heal them.</span>--The pronoun here refers to Christ. St. John in his interpretation of the prophecy has made God ("He") the author of the judicial blindness and hardness, and represents Christ as the physician. This clause is, however, not to be taken separately, but is governed by "that not" which precedes, The effect of their not turning was that Christ could not heal them. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - There are several illustrations in this verse that the <span class="accented">diction</span> of the evangelist differs from that which he uses when recording the words of Christ.

These words are used, not to mitigate the charge, but to show that, though individuals did believe, even among the rulers, they had not courage to avow their faith. The instances of Nicodemus and Joseph and others lie upon the surface. Godet thinks rather of Gamaliel and the like, "the Eras-muses of those days." Theirs was, indeed, an hypocrisy of unbelief, and it is not 'altogether banished from the modern world, and notwithstanding Christ's rejection by the nation as a nation, individuals saw his glory and believed. It is still true of municipalities, nations, even Churches, that they reject Christ, while individuals among them are molded by and obedient to the faith. <span class="cmt_word">But by reason of the Pharisees</span> - our Lord's most deadly enemies, from <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. to <a href="/john/12.htm">John 12</a>. - <span class="cmt_word">they were making no confession</span> - or, <span class="accented">acknowledgment -</span> of his claims, <span class="cmt_word">lest they should be put out of the synagogue</span>; become the excommunicate, fall under the terrible ban (see <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>). The fear of class exclusion, the dread of running counter to the current opinion of the Church or the world, has led to much of the misery of both. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;He has blinded</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#949;&#964;&#973;&#966;&#955;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Tetyphl&#333;ken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5186.htm">Strong's 5186: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make blind, physically or mentally.
