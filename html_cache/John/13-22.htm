The disciples' reaction of looking at one another indicates a shared confusion and concern. This setting is intimate, highlighting the close relationship between Jesus and His followers. The disciples' physical proximity to each other and to Jesus underscores the communal nature of their fellowship. This phrase also reflects the human tendency to seek understanding and reassurance from those around us in times of uncertainty.<p><b>perplexed</b><br>The disciples' perplexity reveals their lack of understanding regarding Jesus' prediction of betrayal. Despite having spent significant time with Jesus, they are still grappling with the full implications of His teachings and the events unfolding. This confusion is a common theme in the Gospels, where the disciples often struggle to comprehend Jesus' mission and the nature of His kingdom. Their perplexity also highlights the unexpected nature of the betrayal, as Judas was one of their own, trusted and part of their inner circle.<p><b>as to which of them He meant</b><br>This phrase indicates that the disciples did not immediately suspect Judas, showing that his betrayal was not obvious to them. It suggests that Judas was outwardly indistinguishable from the other disciples in terms of behavior and commitment. This moment fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where it is foretold that a close friend would betray the Messiah. The uncertainty among the disciples also serves to emphasize the gravity of the situation, as they each question their own loyalty and faithfulness to Jesus.

St. Matthew and St. Mark both state that they expressed their doubt in words, and St. Luke's narrative implies this questioning, but as addressed to one another, not to our Lord ("And they began to inquire among themselves"). St. John remembers the look of astonishment, and the way in which each tried to read the countenance of his brother as they all heard the words, which asserted that there was a traitor in their midst. He was nearest to our Lord, and knew what others may not have known, how Peter beckoned to him, and how he put the question to our Lord. This is the moment which has been caught in Leonardo da Vinci's famous masterpiece in the refectory of the Dominican Fathers at Milan. The painting itself has almost passed away, but perhaps no work of art is so widely known. The three Apostles mentioned in the text are all on the right of our Lord. John is nearest to Him, and leaning towards Peter, who stretches behind Judas to speak to "the disciple whom Jesus loved." Judas, clutching the bag and upsetting the salt, declaring in every feature of that wondrous face, which cost Da Vinci a whole year's study in the lowest quarter of the city, that he is the traitor, is on the right hand of John, and between him and Peter. This verse can have no better comment than a study of this great picture, accompanied by the chapter in Lanzi's <span class= "ital">Storia Pittorica</span> or Mrs. Jameson's <span class= "ital">Sacred and Legendary Art,</span> would provide, and Englishmen have a noble copy of it in their own National Gallery.
