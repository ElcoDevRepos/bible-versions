The Roman governor was already uneasy about the situation, and this claim added a layer of religious and political tension. Pilate's role as a Roman official required him to maintain order, and the mention of Jesus' divine claim would have been particularly troubling, given the Roman pantheon and the emperor's own divine status.<p><b>he brought Jesus out</b><br>Pilate's action of bringing Jesus out signifies a public display, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. This act was meant to show the crowd that he was taking their accusations seriously. It also highlights the Roman practice of public trials and judgments, which were often conducted in open spaces to ensure transparency and maintain public order.<p><b>and sat on the judgment seat</b><br>The judgment seat, or "bema," was a raised platform where officials would sit to pronounce legal decisions. This setting underscores the formal and legal nature of the proceedings. The bema was a symbol of Roman authority and justice, and Pilate's position there indicates his role as the arbiter of life and death in this case. This moment is pivotal, as it represents the official Roman judgment on Jesus, fulfilling the legal requirement for a death sentence.<p><b>at a place called the Stone Pavement</b><br>The Stone Pavement, or "Lithostrotos" in Greek, refers to a paved area used for official gatherings and judgments. Archaeological evidence suggests that such pavements were common in Roman administrative centers. This location would have been significant for its association with Roman authority and governance, providing a stark contrast to the spiritual kingdom Jesus proclaimed.<p><b>which in Hebrew is Gabbatha</b><br>Gabbatha, the Aramaic term for the Stone Pavement, connects the Roman legal proceedings to the Jewish cultural context. This dual naming highlights the intersection of Roman and Jewish worlds in Jerusalem. The use of both names underscores the universality of the events taking place, as they were significant to both Jewish and Gentile audiences. This moment fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being rejected by His own people and judged by the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

The precise location&#8212;Gabbatha&#8217;s stone pavement&#8212;anchors the scene in history while symbolizing the hardness of human hearts and the immovable resolve of God&#8217;s redemptive love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">When Pilate therefore heard that saying.</span>--Better . . . <span class= "ital">these sayings</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the two sayings of the previous verse.<p><span class= "bld">He brought Jesus forth</span> ., .--Comp. <a href="/john/19-9.htm" title="And went again into the judgment hall, and said to Jesus, From where are you?

His own position and life may be in danger, and he prepares, therefore, to pronounce the final sentence, which must necessarily be done from the public judgment seat outside the palace. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/27-19.htm" title="When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.">Matthew 27:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span>--Both these words occur here only, and are instances of the writer's minute knowledge of the localities in Jerusalem. It may have been better to have preserved the Greek name (<span class= "ital">Lithostr?ton</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> as well as that by which the place was known in the Hebrew (Syro-Chaldaic) of the time. The word literally means "stone-paved," and was the Greek name for the tesselated "pavement" of marble and coloured stones with which from the time of Sylla the Romans delighted to adorn the Praetorium. The Chaldee word means "an elevated place," so that the one name was given to it from its <span class= "ital">form,</span> and the other from the material of which it was made. Suetonius (<span class= "ital">Life,</span> chap. 46) tells us that Julius Caesar carried about with him such pieces of marble and stone, but the mention of the <span class= "ital">"</span>place" bears the impression that it was a fixture in front of the Praetorium at Jerusalem, in which the Bema was placed; or it may have been a portion of the northern court of the sanctuary to which Pilate came out, if we identify the Praetorium with the tower Antonia. (Comp. Note on <a href="/matthew/27-27.htm" title="Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered to him the whole band of soldiers.">Matthew 27:27</a>.)

Some commentators and harmonists here introduce the "hand-washing" (see above, <a href="/john/18-40.htm">John 18:40</a>); but such a proceeding at this moment, when he was straightening up his back for the last act of injustice, would have roused fresh and dangerous charges against his personal honor. <span class="cmt_word">He brought Jesus out</span> from the Praetorium to a place in view of the peoples <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">sat down</span> (not, as some say, caused Jesus, in mockery, to take his place upon the judgment-seat (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> has the transitive sense in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, but not in John; and undoubtedly it has the intransitive sense, not only in John, but in <a href="/acts/25-6.htm">Acts 25:6, 17</a>. Moreover, the mockery was the act of the soldiery and of Herod's men of war, not of Pilate). It is remarkable, as Dr. James Drummond (Theological Review, 1877) points out, that Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 1:35) apparently refers to this supposed transitive usage of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> in this very connection by John, by the words, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. It is reasonable inference that Justin read John's Gospel, and supposed him to give transitive force to the verb (see Dr. Salmon, 'Introduction to New Testament,' p. 89, note). <span class="cmt_word">Upon the judgment-seat in a place called</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the tessellated <span class="cmt_word">Pavement</span> - equivalent to "stone-joining" - in which Romans delighted from the days of Sulla; a decoration which Julius Caesar carried about with him (Suet., 'Vit.,' 46.) for purposes of judgment - <span class="cmt_word">but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha</span>. This was probably an elevated and fixed platform overlooking the temple-courts, or joining the Castle of Antonia with the temple. Its etymology is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, the ridge of the house or temple.
