The concept of being "sent" by God is rooted in the Old Testament, where prophets were often described as being sent by God to deliver His messages (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>). Jesus, however, is unique in that He is not merely a prophet but the Son of God, fulfilling the ultimate mission of salvation (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-17</a>). This sending underscores the divine authority and purpose behind Jesus' ministry.<p><b>speaks the words of God</b><br>Jesus' teachings are not His own but are directly from God, emphasizing His divine authority and the truth of His message (<a href="/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>, <a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>). This aligns with the Jewish understanding of a prophet as one who speaks God's words, but Jesus surpasses this role as He embodies the Word of God (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1, 14</a>). His words are life-giving and eternal (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63, 68</a>), and they fulfill the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>).<p><b>for God gives the Spirit without limit</b><br>This phrase highlights the unique relationship between Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Unlike the Old Testament prophets who received the Spirit in a limited measure for specific tasks (e.g., <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>), Jesus possesses the fullness of the Spirit (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). This unlimited anointing empowers His ministry and signifies the new covenant era, where the Spirit is poured out abundantly (<a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-18</a>). It also points to the Trinitarian relationship, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit work in perfect unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, referred to as "the One whom God has sent."

It is the divine image in man which recognises divinity. Every human faculty finds its true work, and true satisfaction, and the true object of its being, in Him; and therefore the whole man knows that His words are true, and recognises that He speaks the words of God. (Comp. <a href="/1_john/5-10.htm" title="He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son.">1John 5:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</span>--The italics will show that the words "unto Him" are added in our version; and it is probable that the word "God," which has been repeated from the first clause of the verse, should be also omitted here. We have then to read, "For He giveth not the Spirit by measure;" or, possibly, "For the Spirit giveth not by measure." If, however, we remember that John the Baptist is the speaker, and that he had seen "the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon Him" (see Note on <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>, and comp. such passages as <a href="/luke/11-13.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?">Luke 11:13</a>, and in this Gospel <a href="/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>), we shall still interpret the words in the sense which our version gives. The words "by measure," in the sense of limitation, are frequent in the classical and rabbinical writings. The Rabbis seem to have applied the phrase to prophets and teachers, saying that the Spirit dwelt in the prophets only in a certain measure. Comp. <a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.">2Kings 2:9</a>, where Elisha prays for "a double portion," or, more exactly, <span class= "ital">a portion of two</span>--the portion of the first-born son (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm" title="But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he has: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>)--of the spirit of Elijah. The same thought meets us in St. Paul (himself a pupil of Gamaliel), who speaks of "the self-same Spirit dividing to every man severally as He will" (see <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1Corinthians 12:4-12</a>). The opposite of this thought, then, is before us here. God gives in this case not as in others. The Son who cometh from above is above all. There is no gift of prophet, or of teacher, which is not given to Him. He has the fulness of the spiritual gifts which in part are given to men, and He speaks the very words of God. It will be noted that John is still expounding to his disciples the meaning of his own declaration, "He must increase, but I must decrease." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> shows that the former utterance is sustained. <span class="cmt_word">For he whom God sent uttereth the words of God.</span> The full, many-sided, abundant expression of the thought of God. He has been sent for this purpose. Some take this clause to refer to all the ambassadors of God, and pre-eminently to the "man (<a href="/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>) sent from God, whose name was John." But, on the ether hand, observe that throughout the Gospel, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> are used of the "Lord from heaven" (ver. 17). Christ certainly is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as well as <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and this great statement, viz. that Christ speaks the words of God, is a justification of the fact that, in accepting the witness of Christ to invisible and eternal things, and in the admission that he has been sent from heaven charged with the words of God, every separate believer becomes a seal, a ratification, of the veracity of God. The clause that follows (seeing that "<span class="accented">to</span> him" <span class="accented">is</span> unquestionably a gloss of translators, and is not found in any manuscripts) may be translated in three different ways. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">For God giveth not the Spirit by measure</span>; for if <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is omitted, still the same subject, "God," might be and is generally supplied, and the object, supposed to be either Christ or any of his servants to whom in these days of the baptism of the Spirit, the Holy Ghost is poured forth from an inexhaustible treasure. Augustine and Calvin urged that it was said concerning Christ; for we read in ver. 35 that "the Father hath given all things into his hand;" but exclusively to limit the object of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> to Christ is more than the passage will justify. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">For he</span> (the Messiah, <span class="accented">sc.</span>) <span class="accented">giveth not the Spirit by measure</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. He</span> is exalted to pour forth from the heart of the Deity the Spirit of the Father and Son. This is preferred by Westcott, and by those who see in the entire passage the reflections of the author of the Gospel (cf. <a href="/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">For the Spirit giveth not by measure</span>; the object (<span class="accented">sc.</span>) being "the words of God," which he who is sent and is coming from heaven, and is above all, is now lavishing upon the world. This translation (Godet) is in harmony with the vision of John at the baptism, when the Holy Spirit after the manner of a dove descended and abode upon him. With an unmeasurable supply of spiritual energy was the <span class="accented">humanity</span> of him who came (<span class="accented">qua</span> his Divine nature and personality) from heaven enriched for his prophetic and Messianic functions as the beloved Son of God on earth.
