The concept of being "clean" is rooted in Jewish purification rituals, which were essential for maintaining ceremonial purity. In the context of Jesus' ministry, being "clean" signifies spiritual purity and readiness to serve God. This statement follows Jesus' teaching on the vine and branches, emphasizing the disciples' connection to Him. The cleansing here is not through ritual but through the transformative power of Jesus' presence and teaching.<p><b>because of the word</b><br>The "word" refers to the teachings and revelations Jesus has imparted to His disciples. In the Gospel of John, the "word" is a central theme, beginning with the declaration that Jesus is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). This highlights the power of Jesus' teachings to purify and sanctify believers. The word of Christ is living and active, capable of transforming hearts and minds, setting apart His followers for God's purposes.<p><b>I have spoken to you</b><br>Jesus emphasizes the personal nature of His relationship with the disciples. The words He has spoken are not just general teachings but direct communications to those who follow Him. This personal interaction underscores the intimate relationship between Jesus and His disciples, a relationship that is foundational for their spiritual growth and mission. The spoken word of Jesus is authoritative and life-giving, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah who would teach and guide His people (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples during the Last Supper, imparting crucial teachings before His crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, representing all believers who follow His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, a significant event where Jesus shares His final teachings and establishes the New Covenant through the breaking of bread and sharing of wine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_word.htm">The Power of the Word</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that His word has the power to cleanse and purify.

As we find in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, the Word is sharper than a two-edged sword, and capable of dealing summarily with "thoughts and intents of the heart." Augustine, on this passage, admits that it is the <span class="accented">Logos</span> which gives all its value to the water of baptism. "This purifying, sanctifying process has been performed upon you," says Christ. Then since "he who sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one," this continuance remains as the gracious possibility. The vital sap proceeds from Christ alone, and not from our corrupted nature, which must be grafted into his life and become part of him. Many may seem to be a part of Christ, to be sacramentally or outwardly united to him, and even to be drawing some real advantages from the contact, and yet their end is fruitlessness, rottenness, removal, fire. The branches which bear fruit never bring forth all they might produce, never realize their ideal. The pruning, cleansing process must pass over every soul, that it may more adequately fulfill its destiny. The cleansing, searching power of the Word will be freely exercised by the Divine Husbandman. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/15-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
