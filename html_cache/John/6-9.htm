In biblical times, children were not typically seen as significant contributors in society. This detail emphasizes God's ability to use the seemingly insignificant to accomplish His purposes, reflecting the theme of God choosing the humble and lowly (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><b>with five barley loaves</b><br>Barley was considered a staple food for the poor, indicating the modest means of the boy. Barley loaves were common in the region of Galilee, where this event took place.

This simple meal underscores the miracle's magnitude, as such a small amount of food would be insufficient for a large crowd. The fish symbolize the natural resources available, which Jesus will multiply, demonstrating His authority over creation.<p><b>But what difference will these make among so many?</b><br>This question, posed by Andrew, reflects human doubt and the limitations of human understanding. It sets the stage for Jesus to demonstrate His divine power and foreshadows the miraculous feeding of the five thousand. This phrase invites readers to consider the contrast between human insufficiency and divine abundance, a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/2_kings/4-43.htm">2 Kings 4:43-44</a>, <a href="/matthew/19-26.htm">Matthew 19:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boy.htm">The Boy</a></b><br>A young, unnamed boy who offers his small meal of five barley loaves and two fish.

A single, unnamed child stands in the foreground of a crowd numbering thousands (<a href="/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights how God uses the seemingly insignificant: David was &#8220;but a youth and ruddy&#8221; when he faced Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>), and Jesus placed a little child in the disciples&#8217; midst to illustrate kingdom greatness (<a href="/matthew/18-2.htm">Matthew 18:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The boy&#8217;s very presence assures us that every person, regardless of age or status, is seen and can be used by the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with five barley loaves</b><p>&#8226; Barley was the bread of common folk; yet these modest loaves become the raw material for a miracle, echoing Elisha&#8217;s provision for one hundred men with &#8220;twenty loaves of barley&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42-44</a>).<p>&#8226; Five literal loaves emphasize the exact, limited resources in hand&#8212;no symbolism is needed to magnify the power of what Jesus will do.<p>&#8226; Barley harvest marked provision in Israel&#8217;s agricultural calendar (<a href="/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15-17</a>), reminding us that every harvest belongs to the Lord who multiplies it at will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and two small fish</b><p>&#8226; John notes not just fish but &#8220;small&#8221; fish, underscoring insufficiency from a human perspective.<p>&#8226; Fish were the livelihood of several disciples (<a href="/luke/5-5.htm">Luke 5:5-6</a>), yet even seasoned fishermen could not foresee the scale of what Jesus intends.<p>&#8226; Later, the risen Christ will again serve fish to His followers (<a href="/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9-13</a>), bookending His earthly ministry with simple meals turned into revelations of His identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But what difference will these make</b><p>&#8226;

The episode anticipates the truth He soon declares: &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), capable of satisfying every hungry soul, &#8220;far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or imagine&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a> spotlights a lone boy&#8217;s meager lunch to contrast human limitation with divine provision. Five humble barley loaves and two small fish, laughably inadequate for thousands, become the backdrop for a miracle that points to Jesus as the all-sufficient Bread of Life. The verse invites us to bring whatever little we possess&#8212;time, talent, resources&#8212;to the Savior who delights to multiply it for His glory and the good of many.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) Again the account of the eye-witness is the more full and life-like. All tell of the five loaves and two fishes. John knows that they are barley loaves--the ordinary black bread of the Galilean peasant; and that the loaves and fishes are not the property of the disciples, but of a lad or slave who has followed the crowd, in the hope, it may be, of finding a purchaser for them.<p>The word for "lad" is a diminutive occurring only here (not in the best text of <a href="/matthew/11-16.htm" title="But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,">Matthew 11:16</a>), and in many MSS. is accompanied by "one." The word may mean a servant, but it more probably means a child. One lad! What could he bear for so many?<p><span class= "bld">Two small fishes.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">two fishes.</span> This word, too, is rightly regarded as a diminutive, but it is not a diminutive of "fish." The original root means <span class= "ital">to boil;</span> thus the substantive is used, as in Homer, of boiled meat, and then of anything eaten as a relish with bread, and specially of fish. This diminutive is used in the New Testament only here and in <a href="/john/6-11.htm" title="And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.">John 6:11</a>, and in <a href="/context/john/21-9.htm" title="As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.">John 21:9-10</a>; <a href="/john/21-13.htm" title="Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.">John 21:13</a>. A comparison of the passages will make it clear that St. John means by the word the ordinary relish of fish, which formed, with bread, the staple food of the people.<p>The whole force of Andrew's remark, with its diminutive words, rests upon the smallness of their power to help, while Philip had dwelt on the greatness of the need. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Here</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8039;&#948;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5602.htm">Strong's 5602: </a> </span><span class="str2">From an adverb form of hode; in this same spot, i.e. Here or hither.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
