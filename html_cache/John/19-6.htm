Their immediate reaction upon seeing Jesus highlights their determination to eliminate Him. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where rulers take counsel against the Lord's Anointed. The religious leaders' hostility towards Jesus had been building throughout His ministry, as He challenged their authority and exposed their hypocrisy (Matthew 23).<p><b>they shouted, &#8220;Crucify Him! Crucify Him!&#8221;</b><br>The call for crucifixion was a demand for the most severe form of Roman execution, reserved for the worst criminals. This reflects the depth of their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. The repetition of "Crucify Him" emphasizes their fervor and determination. This moment fulfills <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Suffering Servant is despised and rejected by men. The crowd's demand also echoes the scapegoat ritual in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where the sins of the people are placed upon one to be sent away.<p><b>&#8220;You take Him and crucify Him,&#8221; Pilate replied</b><br>Pilate's response indicates his reluctance to be responsible for Jesus' death. Historically, Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea, known for his political maneuvering. His statement reflects his attempt to distance himself from the decision, despite having the authority to release Jesus. This moment highlights the tension between Roman authority and Jewish leadership, as well as Pilate's internal conflict, seen in his earlier attempts to release Jesus (<a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38-39</a>).<p><b>&#8220;for I find no basis for a charge against Him.&#8221;</b><br>Pilate's declaration of Jesus' innocence is significant, as it underscores the injustice of the crucifixion. Despite multiple examinations, Pilate could not find any legal grounds for Jesus' execution. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which speaks of the Servant having done no violence nor deceit. Pilate's acknowledgment of Jesus' innocence further highlights the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, where the sinless Lamb of God is sacrificed for the sins of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_officers.htm">Chief Priests and Officers</a></b><br>Religious leaders and temple guards who were instrumental in the arrest and trial of Jesus.

The spectacle, so far from moving their pity, excites their passionate hatred, and they frustrate any other cry which may arise by that of "Crucify Him!" (Comp. <a href="/matthew/27-22.htm" title="Pilate said to them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say to him, Let him be crucified.">Matthew 27:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</span>--Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/18-31.htm" title="Then said Pilate to them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:">John 18:31</a>; <a href="/john/18-38.htm" title="Pilate said to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find in him no fault at all.">John 18:38</a>. "Crucify Him," the words mean, "if you dare to do so; there is no charge on which I can condemn Him; and I will be no party to your act."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When then the chief priests and the officers saw him</span>, they stifled every movement of possible sympathy by "loud harsh cries" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">They cried out, Crucify, crucify him</span>! Scourging and mockery do not meet the case, nor exhaust the curse and the verdict they have already pronounced. He must die the doom of the vilest. He must be done to death as a slave. Pilate saith unto them, certainly not granting to them permission to take the law into their hands, irrespective of the Praetorian court and against his will, but in angry sarcasm, and with an unconcealed threat, Take him, ye yourselves, and crucify; that is, if you dare. Go, do your deed of blood by your own hands, take all the responsibility; for I find no crime in him. Pilate thus derides their powerlessness, and repeats his verdict of acquittal (see <a href="/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a>). At this moment the so-called trial might have ended, so far as Pilate was concerned, with a frank and immediate release. It would seem as though the governor had decided, and there could be no more discussion.
