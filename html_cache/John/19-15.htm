Away with Him! Crucify Him!&#8221;</b><br>The crowd's demand for Jesus' crucifixion reflects the intense rejection He faced from His own people. This moment fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men." The repetition of "Away with Him!" emphasizes the crowd's vehement desire to see Jesus removed and executed. This scene is set during the Passover festival, a time when Jerusalem was filled with Jewish pilgrims, heightening the tension and urgency of the situation. The call for crucifixion, a Roman method of execution, underscores the severity of their demand, as crucifixion was reserved for the most heinous criminals and was considered a curse under Jewish law (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Shall I crucify your King?&#8221; Pilate asked.</b><br>Pilate's question highlights the political and religious tension of the moment. By referring to Jesus as "your King," Pilate is both mocking the Jewish leaders and probing their loyalty. This question underscores the irony of the situation: the Roman governor recognizes the claim of kingship, yet the Jewish leaders reject it. Pilate's reluctance to crucify Jesus is evident throughout the trial, as he repeatedly finds no fault in Him (<a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>; 19:4, 6). This moment also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' own prediction of His death by crucifixion (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32-33</a>).<p><b>&#8220;We have no king but Caesar,&#8221; replied the chief priests.</b><br>The chief priests' declaration is a profound statement of their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. By professing allegiance to Caesar, they deny the kingship of God over Israel, which is a significant departure from Jewish expectation and tradition. This statement is laden with irony, as the Jewish leaders, who despised Roman rule, now claim loyalty to Caesar to ensure Jesus' execution. This moment fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>, where the nations and rulers conspire against the Lord's Anointed. The chief priests' rejection of Jesus as King contrasts with the earlier acclamation of Jesus as King during His triumphal entry into Jerusalem (<a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chief_priests.htm">The Chief Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the Jewish people who played a significant role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.

The verse ultimately proclaims that in rejecting Jesus, humanity confirms its need for the very salvation His crucifixion secures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">But they cried out . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">they cried out therefore .</span> . .

The taunt is uttered in its bitterest form.<p><span class= "bld">We have no king but Caesar.</span>--They are driven by Pilate's taunt, and by their hatred of Jesus, to a denial of their own highest hopes. They who gloried in the Theocracy, and hoped for a temporal Messianic reign, which should free them from Roman bondage; they who boasted that they "were never in bondage to any man" (<a href="/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33</a>); they who were "chief priests" of the Jews, confess that Caesar is their only king. The words were doubtless meant, as those in <a href="/john/19-12.htm" title="And from thereafter Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.">John 19:12</a>, to drive Pilate to comply with their wishes, under the dread of an accusation at Rome. They had this effect.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They on the other hand therefore yelled</span> <span class="cmt_word">out, Away with him! away with (him)! Crucify him</span>! The aorists, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fee;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, imply the haste and impatience which they manifest to have done with the conflict; and Pilate, eager to thrust another envenomed dagger into the heart of their pride, and knowing that to call this Man whom he had made vile in their eyes their "KING," and to crucify One to whom such a title could be given would be gall and wormwood to them, cried, with flashing anger, <span class="cmt_word">Shall I crucify your King</span>? This wrung forth from them a cry which expressed the uttermost and basest abandonment of all their proud boasts, a heartless and fateful acknowledgment of their servility and dependence. <span class="cmt_word">The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar</span>! Our Messianic hope is dead, our national independence is at an end, our witness as a people to truth, our listening to the voice which would have gathered us together, are over. As before they had shouted, "Not this Man, but Barabbas!" so now, "Not the Lord of glory, but the damon lord of Rome; not this King of kings, but Tiberius Augustus et Dominus sacratissimus noster." In renouncing Christ by the lips of their chief priests, they put themselves under the power of the prince of this world, and terribly they answered for their crime. "They elected Caesar to be their king; by Caesar they were destroyed" (Lampe). Their theocracy fell by their mad rage against the perfect embodiment of the highest righteousness and purest love. "The kingdom of God, by the confession of its rulers, has become the kingdom of this world." How terribly symptomatic of the perpetual resistance of his claims by all those who deliberately reject his authority! "We have no king but fashion! .... We have no king but mammon!" "We have no king but the leader of our clique!" "We have no king but pleasure!" "We have no king but our royal selves!" - are voices not infrequently heard even now. This cry was too much for Pilate; he wavered, paltered with justice, vented his insolence and pride, knew better and did the thing which he felt to be base. "He who had often prostituted justice was now utterly unable to achieve the one act of justice which he desired. He who had so often murdered pity was now forbidden to taste the sweetness of a pity for which he longed" (Farrar). <span class="cmt_word">Then therefore he delivered him to them, in order that he might be crucified.</span> "IBIS AD CRUCEM. I MILES EXPEDI CRUCEM," were the awful words in which he would deliver his judgment and secure an everlasting execration. He delivered up Jesus unto them; for they, though not the positive hands by which the foul deed was done, were the sole inciting causes of the act. Luke, as well as John, involves this idea, and Peter (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>) says, "Ye slew him, crucifying him by the hands of lawless men," and (<a href="/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>) "Ye killed the Prince of Life." Yet they were profoundly anxious for his death by Roman crucifixion, not only because thus they were impelled to fulfill the great prophecy and confirm the words of the blessed Lord himself, but because they wished to stamp out in disgrace and shame all his claims; because they wished that the supreme court, the heathen and corrupting power, should dash down to earth and defile this idol of some of the people and even some of their own number; because they wished to deliver themselves from the responsibility of the act, and to avoid being called to give an account to Rome of their judicial murder; and in the act itself they wished to have a Roman guard to prevent an escape and quell an emeute. The school of T&uuml;bingen endeavor to invalidate the Johannine portraiture of Pilate, and to ascribe its fictitious creation in the second century to a desire then rampant, to charge upon the Jews all the blame of the act, and to exhibit Pilate as a symbol of the sympathy which the Gentile world was extending to Christianity and the Church. The persecutions which prevailed from the days of Nero, Domitian, and Trajan, to those of the Antonines, rebuke such a supposition. Moreover, the synoptic narrative is equally explicit with St. John in setting forth the sympathy of Pilate, or rather his desire to release Jesus (<a href="/matthew/27-14.htm">Matthew 27:14</a> and 18, 17-23, 24; <a href="/mark/15-8.htm">Mark 15:8-10</a>; <a href="/luke/23-13.htm">Luke 23:13-22</a>). Luke tells us that Peter charges the guilt of the Crucifixion upon the Jews (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; cf. <a href="/james/5-6.htm">James 5:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>). The explanation of Pilate's conduct and of his final despicable act is given only in John's Gospel; and even Reuss admits that we have in John "the true key of the problem" (see Coder, in loc., vol. 3. pp. 260-263). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
