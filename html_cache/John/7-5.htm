The Gospels mention James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas as His brothers. This familial relationship is significant because it highlights the humanity of Jesus, who grew up in a typical Jewish family setting. In Jewish culture, family ties were strong, and the expectation would be for family members to support one another. The mention of His brothers not believing in Him underscores the challenge Jesus faced in His ministry, even among those closest to Him.<p><b>did not believe in Him.</b><br>This phrase indicates a lack of faith or trust in Jesus' identity and mission. Despite witnessing His miracles and teachings, His brothers were skeptical. This disbelief is significant because it fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be rejected by His own people (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). It also highlights the theme of unbelief that runs throughout the Gospel of John, contrasting those who accept Jesus with those who do not. Later, after the resurrection, at least some of His brothers, notably James, came to believe in Him, as evidenced by James' leadership in the early church (<a href="/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>, <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>).

The verse magnifies both human hard-heartedness and the patient, transforming power of the risen Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">For neither did his brethren believe.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="/john/7-3.htm" title="His brothers therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may see the works that you do.">John 7:3</a>. The words do not admit of any other meaning than the obvious one that even His brethren did not at this time believe Him to be the Messiah. That they are found in the very first chapter of the Acts of the Apostles joining with the Apostles, and the women, and Mary, with one accord in prayer (<a href="/john/7-14.htm" title="Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.">John 7:14</a>), is one of the striking instances of the hardened ground of human hearts passing into the fruitful ground receptive of the seed, as the case of Judas at the close of the last chapter is an instance of the opposite. For the immediate cause of the decisive change, see <a href="/1_corinthians/15-7.htm" title="After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.">1Corinthians 15:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For not even did his brethren believe in him.</span> The evangelist, writing a generation later, and keenly remembering the attitude the brothers had assumed before the Resurrection, adds, "not even his brothers," who ought to have been the most prominent of his disciples, "did up to this time believe on him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> entrust themselves to him, dispose of their prejudices, change their conceptions, accept his spiritual lead, acknowledge his Divine mission, or know him to be the Holy One of God. They had not come into the position of the twelve. What ideas soever they grasped fell immeasurably short of "eating his flesh and drinking his blood," of coming to him, being given to him and drawn to him by the Father. It was a world Messiah, a theocratic King, a Prophet-Captain, a royal Christ, that they sought and would have been glad to find in him. This treatment of the Lord was another striking parallel to the temptation of Jesus as described by the synoptists, "All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me" (see note on ch. 4, and Introduction, VIII. 5). The non-belief of the brothers is in remarkable unison with the widespread unbelief of the people, who were anxious to discern the Christ of their own traditional expectations, and ready to press almost any possible claimant to premature demonstrations. The Pharisees and the people sought some sign from heaven. But while the people demanded it, they expected that he would and might gratify them if he chose. The Pharisees cynically tempted him to proclaim what they believed would prove his irremediable failure (Weiss, 'Life of Christ.,' vol. 3. Eng. trans., pp. 167-188). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
