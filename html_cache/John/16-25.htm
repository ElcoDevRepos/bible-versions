This method was common in Jewish teaching, allowing listeners to engage with the message on multiple levels. The use of figures of speech can be seen throughout the Gospels, such as in the parables of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>) and the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>). These stories were designed to reveal truths to those who were spiritually receptive while concealing them from those who were not. This approach fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> about people hearing but not understanding.<p><b>An hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you this way,</b><br>Jesus refers to a future time when His teachings will be made clear. This "hour" signifies a pivotal moment in salvation history, often associated with His death, resurrection, and the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. The disciples would soon experience a transformation in their understanding, as the Holy Spirit would guide them into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). This promise of clarity is a reassurance that the mysteries of the Kingdom will be unveiled to them.<p><b>but will tell you plainly about the Father.</b><br>The promise of speaking plainly indicates a direct revelation of God's nature and will. Jesus, as the Son, has unique access to the Father and reveals Him fully (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>). This direct communication is a fulfillment of the new covenant, where God writes His laws on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>). The clarity of Jesus' future teachings would be evident in the apostles' writings and the early church's understanding of the Gospel, as seen in the epistles where the nature of God and His plan for salvation are expounded.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being prepared for a deeper understanding of spiritual truths.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father, whom Jesus will reveal more plainly to the disciples.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/figures_of_speech.htm">Figures of Speech</a></b><br>Refers to the parables and metaphors Jesus used to convey spiritual truths.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coming_time.htm">The Coming Time</a></b><br>Refers to the period after Jesus' resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit, when the disciples will gain clearer understanding.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_through_the_spirit.htm">Understanding Through the Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in illuminating the truths of God.

For the Twelve, the symbols built anticipation: every parable about seeds, nets, vines, and shepherds pointed to the kingdom and to Jesus Himself (<a href="/john/10-6.htm">John 10:6</a>; 15:1&#8211;5).<p>&#8226;

There is a sense in which it is necessarily true of all Christ's teaching, and of all teaching in words. They are but parables until the truth which they contain has been thought out by the man that hears them. For the disciples much of Christ's teaching remained in a parabolic form, until the Spirit brought all things which He had said to the mind, and quickened their minds so that they could grasp its meaning.
