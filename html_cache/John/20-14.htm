This moment echoes other instances in Scripture where Jesus is not immediately recognized, such as the road to Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13-35</a>).

She has expressed her woe, and turns aside again to weep, when she sees another form. Weighed down by her sorrow, not looking intently, it may be, or seeing indistinctly through tear-filled eyes, she does not recognise her Lord. We know not what the appearance was. Figure, feature, clothing, there must have been; but these differing, in this as in other manifestations, from those with which they had been familiar. She, perhaps, hardly looked at all, but supposed that the only person there at that early hour would be the keeper of the garden.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Then follows the simple record of the most wonderful event in the history of the world. There and then a flash of light broke on one human soul, and on human life at large, which has been brightening and broadening in its luster till this very hour. With what awful and tender simplicity is it related! <span class="cmt_word">When she had said this, she turned herself back</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>) to what was behind her, away from the angels, and from their apparent but fruitless offer of sympathy, still weeping passionately in the utter desolation of a broken heart. But why did she turn? Was she not conscious of a presence near her which she had not seen? The blind are Often aware of the presence of unseen persons, when no footfall is heard and no word spoken. <span class="cmt_word">And beholdeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Jesus standing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, perfect participle), as though for some time he had been standing there, watching her (cf. that which he had said to the eleven (<a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>), "I will see you"). But strange, mysterious, unutterably wonderful, entirely and absolutely inconsistent with the hypothesis, to which we have often referred, that this book is a theological romance, John, on Mary's own authority, adds, <span class="cmt_word">She knew not that it was Jesus.</span> This is one of those remarkably vivid and autoptic touches that carry conviction of truth, whatever may be the explanation or the conclusion to be drawn from it. How far was this lack of recognition due to her, and how far to this the first manifestation made of "spiritual body" to human ken? Some have frigidly taken a commonplace explanation. Her eyes were blinded with continuous weeping; or the darkness of the morning; or Jesus may have stood in the shadows of the city wall, as the glare of the first beam of sunrise broke out of the purple mists on the Moab hills; or Christ's appearance was so changed by the agony through which he had passed, and by the recovery and reconstitution of his humanity, that the signs of his identity were obscured. He could not have clothed himself with the glittering garments of the Transfiguration, or with the dazzling robes of angels; for she mistook him for the keeper of the garden, either for Joseph of Arimathaea himself or his steward. "She knew not that it was Jesus." Human eyes are often holden so that they do not see the Lord, even when by some objective manifestation he makes it possible to do this thing. Thus (<a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>), "Manoah knew not that it was the angel of the Lord." And several other of the theophanies of the Old Testament, encountering the blindness of human vision, slowly dawn upon even prophetic intelligence. Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Samuel, are all instances. And we find that in <a href="/matthew/28-16.htm">Matthew 28:16, 17</a>, "some doubted" the Resurrection, even when the vision led others to adore (<a href="/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16</a>). The eyes of Cleophas and his friend were holden, even though their hearts were burning. Those who traveled with Paul to Damascus saw a light and heard a sound, but they did not see nor did they hear what the apostle saw and heard. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> of the risen Jesus was not, according to Mark (<a href="/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>), always the same. For the vision and perception of this mode of being, the eye needs special training and preparation. Though the eyes of love are the quickest to discern these wondrous realities, yet the vision tarries, and is for an appointed time, and even they who ultimately see have to wait for it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When she had said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(eipousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
