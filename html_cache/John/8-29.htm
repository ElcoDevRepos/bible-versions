In the context of the Gospel of John, Jesus frequently speaks of being sent by the Father, highlighting His divine mission and authority (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). The presence of the Father with Jesus underscores the unity within the Trinity, a central tenet of Christian doctrine. This unity is also reflected in the Old Testament, where God promises His presence with His chosen servants, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). The assurance of God's presence is a recurring theme, providing comfort and authority to those He sends.<p><b>He has not left Me alone,</b><br>This statement reflects the constant companionship and support of the Father throughout Jesus' earthly ministry. It contrasts with the human experience of abandonment and loneliness, emphasizing the divine support Jesus enjoys. This assurance is crucial as Jesus faces increasing opposition from religious leaders (<a href="/john/8-13.htm">John 8:13</a>). Theologically, it points to the fulfillment of God's promises to never forsake His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>). It also prefigures the promise of the Holy Spirit to believers, ensuring they are never alone (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-18</a>).<p><b>because I always do what pleases Him.&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus asserts His perfect obedience to the Father, a key aspect of His sinless nature. This obedience is central to His role as the perfect sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). The phrase echoes the prophetic words of <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, where the suffering servant fulfills God's will. Jesus' actions consistently align with the Father's desires, setting an example for believers to follow (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). This obedience is not merely external but stems from a deep, intrinsic alignment with the Father's will, highlighting the moral and spiritual perfection of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking about His relationship with the Father, emphasizing His obedience and the Father's presence with Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father (God)</a></b><br>Referred to as "He who sent Me," the Father is depicted as being in constant communion with Jesus, affirming the divine mission and unity between the Father and the Son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the broader context of <a href="/bsb/john/8.htm">John 8</a> involves Jesus addressing the Jewish leaders and the crowd, challenging their understanding of His identity and mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting for this discourse, where Jesus often taught and engaged with both followers and skeptics.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mission_of_jesus.htm">The Mission of Jesus</a></b><br>The event of Jesus' earthly ministry, characterized by His obedience to the Father and His role as the Savior.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_presence.htm">Divine Presence</a></b><br>Just as the Father was with Jesus, believers can trust in God's constant presence in their lives.

Together these truths assure us that Jesus speaks and acts with full divine backing, guaranteeing the reliability of His words and the sufficiency of His redeeming work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">The Father hath not left me alone.</span>--The Greek words mean exactly, <span class= "ital">the Father</span> (or, as the better MSS. read, without change of meaning, <span class= "ital">He</span>)<span class= "ital"> left Me not alone,</span> and they are sometimes taken to refer to the time of His mission into the world. The context rather points to their application to every moment of life. He was ever conscious of a Presence which they knew not of, but which the future should reveal to them. We shall find Him resting in this consciousness again when He looks on to the dark hour when the disciples shall be scattered every man to his own, and He shall be left as men would think alone. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/16-32.htm" title="Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.">John 16:32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For</span> <span class= "greekheb"><span class= "bld">?</span></span> <span class= "bld">do always those things that please him.</span>--It would be less ambiguous to read, <span class= "ital">because I do always</span> . . . The words furnish the reason for the presence of the Father in every act and moment of His life. All things done by Him at all times were in accordance with the Father's will. In His human nature perpetual communion is conditioned by perpetual obedience. The same thought recurs in His words to the disciples in <a href="/john/15-10.htm" title="If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.">John 15:10</a>. Comp. also, on the relation of the Son to the Father, Note on <a href="/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a>.<p>Emphasis should be laid here upon the pronoun, "for <span class= "ital">I</span> do always." It was true of His human nature, as distinct from all others, that no act, at any moment of life, had cast its shadow on the brightness of the vision of the Father's presence. Later in this same discourse (<a href="/john/8-46.htm" title="Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?">John 8:46</a>) He appeals to their knowledge of His holy life. Here, in words that none other in human form could ever utter, He appeals to His own consciousness of a life, every act of which was pleasing in the presence of God.<p>[(<span class= "ital">b</span>)<span class= "ital"> Jesus is Light </span>(<span class= "ital">continued</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he that sent me</span> - of whom I now plainly speak to you as "the Father" - <span class="cmt_word">is with me</span>.

This self-consciousness of Christ is one of the loftiest and most entirely unique phenomena recorded in history. This absolute confidence with reference to his whole course lifts our Lord to a pinnacle of the loftiest elevation. He declares himself absolutely free from sin, and even in thought or deed to have left undone nothing that seemed good to the Father. If such an utterance had not flashed the conviction of his Divine nature upon some of his hearers, it is impossible to conceive what would or could have done so <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
