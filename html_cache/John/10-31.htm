This statement is a profound claim of unity with God, which the Jewish audience perceives as blasphemy. The context is crucial as it highlights the escalating tension between Jesus and the Jewish leaders, who are increasingly hostile to His teachings and claims.<p><b>the Jews</b><br>In the Gospel of John, "the Jews" often refers to the Jewish religious leaders and authorities rather than the Jewish people as a whole. These leaders are portrayed as being in opposition to Jesus throughout the Gospel. Their reaction is rooted in their understanding of the Law and their perception of Jesus' claims as a threat to their religious authority and traditions.<p><b>again picked up stones</b><br>The word "again" indicates that this is not the first time the Jewish leaders have attempted to stone Jesus. A previous instance is recorded in <a href="/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>, where they reacted similarly to Jesus' claim of divinity. Stoning was a prescribed method of execution for blasphemy according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). This action reflects their belief that Jesus has committed blasphemy by equating Himself with God.<p><b>to stone Him</b><br>Stoning was a common form of capital punishment in ancient Jewish law for certain offenses, including blasphemy. The act of picking up stones signifies their intent to carry out this punishment immediately, without a formal trial. This reflects the severity of their reaction to Jesus' claim and their understanding of the law. Theologically, this moment foreshadows the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus, fulfilling the prophecies of the suffering Messiah (Isaiah 53).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching and revealing His divine nature, which provokes a strong reaction from the Jewish leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Referring to the Jewish leaders and people who were present during Jesus' teaching.

Their action follows as an effect caused by His words. The word "again" reminds us that they had done this two months before, at the Feast of Tabernacles (8:59). The words for "took up" are not the same. There the sense is, "they lifted up stones," and we are told that Jesus hid Himself; here the meaning is, "they carried stones," there being none in the cloister where they were. During this process their first burst of anger expended itself, and our Lord further disarms it with a question.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-39.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Resented and challenged</span>, <span class="accented">but vindicated by word and sign</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - That the Jews supposed him to speak of an essential unity is obvious from what follows. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews (then</span><span class="cmt_word">) took up</span> - should rather be <span class="accented">carried</span> or <span class="accented">bore</span> in their hands - <span class="cmt_word">stones again</span>, huge pieces of marble lying around in the public works then proceeding.
