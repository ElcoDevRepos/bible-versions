Stone jars were used because they were considered less likely to become ritually impure compared to earthenware. The number six, often associated with imperfection or incompleteness in biblical numerology, contrasts with the perfection of the miracle Jesus is about to perform. This setting is at a wedding in Cana, a small village in Galilee, highlighting the humble beginnings of Jesus' public ministry.<p><b>for the Jewish rites of purification</b><br>These purification rites were part of the Mosaic Law, emphasizing the importance of ritual cleanliness. The water in these jars was used for washing hands and utensils, a practice rooted in the traditions of the elders (<a href="/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3-4</a>). This context underscores the transition from the old covenant, focused on external purification, to the new covenant, which emphasizes internal transformation through Christ. The use of these jars for a miracle signifies a shift from the old ways to the new life Jesus offers.<p><b>Each could hold from twenty to thirty gallons</b><br>The large capacity of these jars, approximately 120 to 180 gallons in total, highlights the abundance of the miracle. This abundance is a recurring theme in Jesus' ministry, reflecting God's generous provision (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). The transformation of such a large quantity of water into wine also symbolizes the overflowing grace and blessings found in Christ. This miracle prefigures the new wine of the kingdom of God, as seen in the eschatological banquet imagery in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the Gospel of John, performing His first recorded miracle at the wedding in Cana.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wedding_at_cana.htm">Wedding at Cana</a></b><br>- The setting of Jesus' first miracle, where He turned water into wine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_rites_of_purification.htm">Jewish Rites of Purification</a></b><br>- Ceremonial practices in Judaism involving water for cleansing, highlighting the cultural and religious context of the event.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/stone_water_jars.htm">Stone Water Jars</a></b><br>- Large containers used for purification, symbolizing the old covenant and Jewish traditions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>- Followers of Jesus who witnessed the miracle, strengthening their faith in Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purification.htm">Symbolism of Purification</a></b><br>The stone jars represent the old covenant and the Jewish law.

These were placed in the outer court, away from the guest-chamber, for the governor of the feast is ignorant of the circumstances (<a href="/john/2-9.htm" title="When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from where it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,">John 2:9</a>). It is natural that an eyewitness should remember the number and know roughly their size. There were six of them, containing about twenty gallons apiece; but hidden meanings referring to the number or the quantity are brought to the text, not derived from it. The measure rendered "firkin" is <span class= "ital">metretes,</span> which is used for the Hebrew, "bath" in <a href="/2_chronicles/4-5.htm" title="And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.">2Chronicles 4:5</a>. This (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> viii. 2, ? 9) gives nearly nine gallons as the value of the "firkin," which multiplied by two or three gives the contents of each pitcher as from about eighteen to twenty-seven gallons; or, approximately, from 100 to 150 gallons for the whole. Our own word "firkin" is probably "a little fourth," and equal to nine gallons, or the fourth of a barrel (comp. Tierce, which is one-third). It is used only here in the Bible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there were</span> (<span class="accented">set</span>, or) <span class="cmt_word">placed there six water pots of stone, after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.</span> Stone was often used for these receptacles, as more calculated to preserve the purity of the water (Wunsche refers to 'Beza,' 2:2; Westcott quotes 'Sofa,' 4; Barclay, in his translation of 'Mishna,' &sect; 17, enumerates earthenware and other material as lawful). It is interesting that these stone jars are still used in this very neighbourhood for like purposes ('Pict. Palestine'). This large number of jars of considerable magnitude was doubtless due in part to the number of the guests, and to the scrupulous attention to ceremonial purity that was enjoined by the oral law (see 'Mishna,' &sect; 17; and Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). They were accustomed to wash, not only the hands, but "cups, brazen vessels, and tables" (see <a href="/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a> and parallel passages). (For this use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, see <a href="/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>, in which "according to" easily passes into the sense of "for the sake of, after the manner of.") The Attic measure <span class="accented">metretes</span> was equal to the Hebrew <span class="accented">bath</span> (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:02. 9), and stands for it in the LXX. of <a href="/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a>, and this equalled 1.5 Roman <span class="accented">amphorae</span>, 8 gallons + 7.5 pints. So that six jars containing 2 or 3 metretes, say 2.5 = 6 x 2.5 x 8 gallons + 7.5 pints = 6 x 2.5 &times; 71.5 pints = 134 gallons and a fraction. The jars may have differed in shape, according as they were adapted for different purposes; but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span> must be translated distributively, and we cannot evade the enormous capacity of the jars, and therefore the abundance of the gift thus provided. Various efforts have been made to reduce the extent of the provision; but the obvious implication of the narrative is that the six jars were the <span class="accented">locale</span> of the miracle. Dr. Moulton and Dr. Westcott suggest that these water pots were filled with pure water, but that the wine was "drawn" from the water supply to which the servants had access, and that no more wine was provided than that which was borne to the governor of the feast. Others have supposed that simply the water <span class="accented">drawn</span> from the jars was transformed in the process. These suppositions make the entire reference to the water pots extremely obscure and unnecessary. The large quantity of wine thus offered to these humble folks corresponds with the affluence of Nature in all her moods - the munificence of spring blossoms, the harvest of the sea, the exuberance of sunlight, the superfluity of rain that falls on the oceans, the copiousness of all God's ways. When, on other occasions, the Lord added to the supplies of food in fishes and bread, his lavish abundance corresponds with the riches of his loving kindness on this occasion. There was provided, not the material for a meal, but an ample dowry for such a bride. No mere magical change, momentarily confounding perception and leaving no trace behind, but a supply which would be a standing proof of the reality of what had been done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">six</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7955;&#958;</span> <span class="translit">(hex)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1803.htm">Strong's 1803: </a> </span><span class="str2">Six.
