In Jewish culture, early morning was a time for prayer and study, aligning with the practice of beginning the day with spiritual focus. This timing also reflects the eagerness of the people to hear Jesus, as they gathered early to listen to His teachings.<p><b>He went back into the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts were a central place of worship and teaching in Jerusalem. Jesus returning to the temple signifies His authority and role as a teacher. The temple was the heart of Jewish religious life, and His presence there underscores His fulfillment of the law and the prophets. This setting also highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, as the temple was under their jurisdiction.<p><b>All the people came to Him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the widespread interest and attraction Jesus had among the people. His teachings were accessible and compelling, drawing large crowds. This gathering of people also sets the stage for the events that follow, where Jesus' authority and wisdom are contrasted with the legalism of the Pharisees.<p><b>and He sat down to teach them</b><br>Sitting was the traditional posture of a rabbi or teacher in Jewish culture, indicating authority and readiness to instruct. Jesus sitting to teach reflects His role as the ultimate Rabbi, imparting divine wisdom. This act of teaching in the temple courts connects to other instances in the Gospels where Jesus teaches with authority, often challenging and redefining the understanding of the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, known for His teaching and authority.

There is some ground for the deviation. The scenes of the previous day had been broken up into various groups. The favouring crowd from the provinces sympathized with a portion of the Jerusalem populace; then the hostile crowd at the beck of the authorities had been checked by the "officers" who had been themselves baffled and thunderstruck with the dignity and claims of Jesus. Great excitement had prevailed, and before the stormy scenes and recriminations of the previous day recommenced, the whole temple throng came unto him. If the eighth day of the feast was referred to - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if the great day of the feast were the eighth day - the difficulty of the whole people having gathered about him is diminished, because there were special gatherings for the eighth day (see notes, <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>).
