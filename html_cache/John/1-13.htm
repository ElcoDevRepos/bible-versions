In the Jewish context, lineage and ancestry were significant, as seen in the genealogies of the Old Testament. However, this new birth transcends ethnic or familial ties, aligning with the promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It highlights the shift from a focus on physical descent to a spiritual rebirth available to all, regardless of heritage.<p><b>nor of the desire or will of man</b><br>This part underscores that the new birth is not a result of human effort or decision. In the Greco-Roman world, lineage and social status were often determined by human will and desire, such as through adoption or marriage alliances. However, this spiritual birth is distinct from human intentions or actions. It aligns with Paul's teaching in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which states that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of works, so no one can boast. It emphasizes the divine initiative in the process of salvation.<p><b>but born of God</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine origin of the new birth, indicating that it is an act of God. It reflects the concept of regeneration, where believers are made new creations in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). This transformation is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people. It also connects to Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-8</a>, where He explains that one must be born of the Spirit to enter the kingdom of God.

The nation claimed this through its descent from Abraham. But they are Abraham's children who are of Abraham's faith. There is a higher generation, which is spiritual, while they thought only of the lower, which is physical. The condition is the submissive receptivity of the human spirit.
