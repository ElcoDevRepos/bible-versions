It commemorates the Israelites' 40 years of wandering in the desert and God's provision during that time. This feast involves dwelling in temporary shelters, or booths, as a reminder of the transient nature of life and God's protection. It is a time of great joy and celebration, marked by rituals such as the water-drawing ceremony and the lighting of lamps, which have deep spiritual significance. The feast also points to the future messianic age, where God will dwell with His people, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-19</a>.<p><b>was near.</b><br>The timing of the feast is significant, as it occurs in the fall, around September or October.

The nearness of the feast suggests an urgency and anticipation in the narrative, as Jesus' public ministry is reaching a critical point.

By the first century these gatherings carried both divinely ordained meaning and national flavor.<p>&#8226; As one of the three pilgrimage feasts, every Jewish male was expected to attend (<a href="/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).<p>&#8226; These feasts formed a yearly rhythm that pointed ahead to Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>).

Finally, noting the feast &#8220;was near&#8221; sets the stage for the exact moment when Christ will reveal more of His identity, proving that heaven&#8217;s timetable is always fulfilled, no matter the human resistance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The Jews' feast of tabernacles.</span>--This began on "the fifteenth day of the seventh month" (<a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:34</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the 15th of Tishri, which answers to our September. The interval, then, from Passover to Tabernacles is one of about five months. The feast continued for seven days, during which all true Israelites dwelt in booths, in remembrance of their dwelling in tabernacles when they came out of the land of Egypt. Like the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Passover) and the Feast of Harvest (Pentecost), this Feast of In-gathering was one of the "three times in the year" when every male Jew was required to appear before the Lord God (<a href="/exodus/23-14.htm" title="Three times you shall keep a feast to me in the year.">Exodus 23:14</a>). Josephus speaks of it as the holiest and greatest of the feasts. It was at once a thankful memorial of the national deliverance, and a yearly rejoicing at the close of each succeeding harvest (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/16-13.htm" title="You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:">Deuteronomy 16:13-16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee:</span> <span class="cmt_word">for he was not willing</span> <span class="cmt_word">to walk in Judaea,</span> <span class="cmt_word">because the Jews were seeking to</span> <span class="cmt_word">kill him. Now</span> <span class="cmt_word">the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Tabernacles, was at hand.</span> The last clause supplies a valuable chronological datum. This great climacteric feast of ingathering and joyful memories of all the goodness of Jehovah was held on the fifteenth day of the seventh month (<a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>). Consequently, according to John's own statement, six months had elapsed between the transactions at Bethsaida and Capernaum, and those which he now proceeds to describe. During these six months some of the most thrilling events in the synoptic narrative must have been enacted. The Lord "walked in Galilee." He had discussed the whole question of Pharisaic and ceremonial cleansing and food, and the entire principle of revelation and tradition (<a href="/matthew/15.htm">Matthew 15</a>. and <a href="/mark/7.htm">Mark 7</a>.). He had given express illustration of his own teaching by venturing even into heathen cities, and there healing the Syro-Phoenician's child. He had journeyed towards the north of Palestine, into the Greek cities of Decapolis (<a href="/mark/7-31.htm">Mark 7:31</a>), and had made a great demonstration of his healing powers on the mountain heights above the Sea of Galilee. There too (<a href="/mark/7-1.htm">Mark 7:1-9</a>) he had once more fed multitudes by his word, on the second miraculous meal. It is probable that the multitudes were Gentiles, whose stock of food would have been exhausted by a three days' sojourn; that at least they were not excitable Galilaeans, who might come by force and make him a King. The Pharisees assailed him, asking for a sign. The disciples, by the mouth of Peter, had confessed their faith (<a href="/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-28</a>) in more explicit form and force than before (<a href="/john/6-68.htm">John 6:68, 69</a>), and Christ had explained in yet more definite terms than in the synagogue in Capernaum the needs be for his Passion, death, and resurrection. The Transfiguration on the mountain, with its ineffaceable impressions, had followed, with numerous miracles, parables, and connected instructions (<a href="/matthew/16.htm">Matthew 16, 17, 18</a>.). Jesus walked for six months in Galilee, knowing, as we learn from these verses, that the authorities in Jerusalem were utterly hostile to him, and had neither forgotten nor forgiven the assertion of his special claims when he was on the last occasion in Jerusalem at the unnamed feast (be it the Feast of Passover or Tabernacles, the Feast of Purim or Trumpets). The outburst of hostility which kept him so long from Jerusalem was circulating in angry vibrations to the very borders of Galilee. The hour for the final conflict was in abeyance until he had preached more explicitly the Divine gospel of love and redemption, and had left the indestructible seed in human hearts. There was malice in Galileo as well as in Judaea, but it took a different form. Thoma regards the sixth chapter as the ideal treatment by the fourth evangelist of the events recorded in the synoptic narrative, and, strangely enough, treats the wonders on the sea and on the land as parallels to the synoptic account of the temptation! The objection to this is not so much the underlying dissimilarity of idea as the chronological position assigned by Matthew and Luke to the temptation before John was imprisoned, whereas these events occur after his execution. Further, the synoptists record these two miracles in their proper place in the biography <span class="accented">as well as</span> describe the temptation. That the deep inner meaning and teaching of ch. 6. corresponds with that of the last Supper, no reader can miss; nor that this confession of Peter is the highest point of the earlier and later narratives we do not question; but their striking resemblance to each other, instead of transforming this Gospel into a philosophical allegory, appears to us to prove that we have the same historic Christ in Both narratives. The Feast of Tabernacles, the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or tent pitching, called by Philo <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, was the last great feast of the sacred year. It had its relation to the natural and providential goodness of God. Just as the Passover commemorated the opening of the harvest and the first fruits of the grain, and as Pentecost celebrated the completion of the harvest, so the "Tabernacles" implied the ingathering of the fruit of the vine and of the olive, and summed up the joyful acknowledgments for the whole year. Again, as the "Passover" recorded the deliverance from Egyptian bondage by the destroying angel who spared the blood sprinkled home, and the "Pentecost" probably (Maimonides) commemorated the giving of the Law, so the "Tabernacles" recalled in a festive form the time of Israel's wandering in the wilderness, when they dwelt in tabernacles. Joyfulness and astonishing ceremonial characterized the festival. The city of palaces broke out into booths of trees and leaves in every possible space, on walls and housetops in courtyards, and even in waggons and on the backs of camels. The people carried their palm branches and citrons in their hands, and great merriment, almost suggestive of heathen rites, prevailed. It probably gathered up about it, as some Christian festivals have done, other ancient or surrounding customs. The number of bullocks sacrificed during the seven days - one fewer on each day, beginning with thirteen - amounted in all to <span class="accented">seventy</span> (13+12+11+10+9+8+7 = 70). This the rabbis regarded as referring to the seventy nations of heathendom. Additional peculiarities were conspicuous in the immense number of priests who were required to take part in the sacrifices. The blasts of priests' trumpets which regulated the ceremonial, the great musical procession employed in brining water from the Pool of Siloam, then within the city wall, added another noticeable feature. The water was brought in a golden goblet, and poured into a silver funnel, which conveyed it by pipes to the Kedron, and was thus supposed to bless the thirsty land. This act was accompanied by singing the great <span class="accented">Hallel</span>, and the shouts and songs of Zion were heard far over hill and valley. At night time universal illumination prevailed, and huge candelabra in the temple court shed a radiance over the whole city. These peculiarities of the feast rendered it the most popular, if not the most sacred, of all the feasts ('Ant.,' 8:04, 1, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>). It was a time when the national sentiment often burst into fierce flame. Various historic glories of the past were called to remembrance, and spiritual privileges were symbolized in the ritual. The fact that the feast held this important place in the affections and enthusiasm of the people explains the anxiety of the family of Jesus that, whatever his claims really were, they should be canvassed in the metropolis and decided by the only authorities adequate to the task. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">However,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
