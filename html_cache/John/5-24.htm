It is a solemn affirmation, indicating that what follows is of great significance. In Jewish culture, repetition is a method of emphasizing certainty and authority. Jesus uses this phrase to assert His divine authority and the reliability of His words.<p><b>whoever hears My word</b><br>Hearing in this context implies not just the physical act of listening but an active, obedient response to Jesus' teachings. In the Jewish tradition, hearing is closely linked to obedience, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). Jesus' word refers to His teachings and the revelation of God's will through Him. This phrase underscores the importance of receiving and responding to the message of Christ.<p><b>and believes Him who sent Me</b><br>Belief here is more than intellectual assent; it involves trust and reliance on God the Father, who sent Jesus. This phrase highlights the relationship between Jesus and the Father, emphasizing the divine mission of Christ. It reflects the consistent theme in John's Gospel of Jesus being sent by the Father (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, <a href="/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>). Belief in the Father is inseparable from belief in the Son, as they are united in purpose and essence.<p><b>has eternal life</b><br>Eternal life is a present possession for the believer, not just a future hope. This life is characterized by a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. In the context of John's Gospel, eternal life is knowing God and Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). It contrasts with the temporal life and is a central theme in the New Testament, offering assurance of salvation and a transformed life.<p><b>and will not come under judgment</b><br>This phrase assures believers that they are exempt from the final judgment that leads to condemnation. It reflects the promise of <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, where there is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus. The judgment referred to here is the ultimate separation from God, which believers are spared from through faith in Christ.<p><b>Indeed, he has crossed over from death to life</b><br>This metaphor of crossing over signifies a definitive change in spiritual status. Death represents separation from God due to sin, while life represents reconciliation and union with God. This transition is immediate upon belief, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a>, where believers are made alive with Christ. It echoes the Exodus theme of passing from slavery to freedom and is a powerful image of salvation and transformation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, emphasizing His authority and the truth of His message.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father (Him who sent Me)</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, highlighting the divine mission and unity between the Father and the Son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who hear and believe in Jesus' words and the One who sent Him, receiving the promise of eternal life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>The gift promised to believers, signifying a present and future reality of life with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The divine assessment from which believers are exempt, having passed from death to life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hearing_and_believing.htm">Hearing and Believing</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of not just hearing the Word but actively believing in it.

This truth explains the "whom He willeth" of <a href="/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a> to have no limit but that of human receptivity.

He that hears this word believes not on Him only, but on Him that sent Him (comp. <a href="/john/12-44.htm" title="Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.">John 12:44</a>). It asserts that eternal life is not of the future only, but is already in germ possessed by the man who is thus brought into communion with the source of life. (Comp. <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1John 1:2</a>.) This man comes not into judgment. There can be for him no separation from God, no condemnation. He has already passed from the state of death to that of life. What remains for him is the development of life. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - In this verse the discourse turns from the relations between the Father and the Son, to deal with the relations of the living Christ (the "I," who is speaking throughout) with men. In vers. 21-23, indeed Vers. 19-23, the Lord had been speaking prominently of the ideal sonship, of "the Son" on the Divine side of his consciousness. The use of the first person, which is here resumed, calls more express attention to the consciousness of his human manifestation, which again reaches its climax in ver. 27. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you -</span> I, whose voice you now hear, whom you are misunderstanding, rejecting, and seeking to slay. <span class="accented">I say</span> with most solemn emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">He that heareth my word</span> - this term, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, suggests moral as well as physical hearing, and means whosoever allows my thought to penetrate his nature, hears and understands, hears and acts accordingly (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a><span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> 5; 13:9, 18; <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7, 17</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-22.htm">Revelation 3:22</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="accented">further <span class="cmt_word"></span>believeth him that sent me;</span> believeth <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that he has borne and is continually bearing true witness concerning me. There is a different meaning conveyed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, with the simple dative, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, and again <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>; these prepositions convey a gradually deepening sense of intercommnnion and dependence; the simple accusative is found in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>; Ellicott on <a href="/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>). To believe on a person, or in one, conveys a different idea from believing that person with regard to any special assertion he may make. Here the belief of God has emphatic reference to the testimony the Father is bearing to the claims of Jesus. Such a hearer, such a believer, <span class="cmt_word">hath eternal life</span>; even here he has entered into the "eternal now;" on earth he is in possession of the blessed consummation. Such belief in words authenticated by the Father's commission is eternal life (cf. <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). It lifts a man out of the reach of corruption and condemnation, it ushers him into eternity, it is an eternal blessedness in itself; <span class="cmt_word">and he cometh not to judgment, but has passed from the death, into the life.</span> He is already translated from the death state to the renewed, quickened state. The decision and discrimination between him and the world have taken place. The judgment is over, the books are closed, the condemnation is no longer possible. He will not perish, he has eternal life. "The believer is tree from the judgment which executes itself in the exclusion inflicted on the unbeliever, by the revelation of Jesus as the Light, because he is already in possession of the saving blessing" (Luthardt). Judgment, being completed, does not require repetition" (Godet). "When that confidence in Christ has illumined the heart wherein we recognize that we have been verily accepted, listened to, ruled, and defended by God, peace follows, and high joyfulness, which is the realization of eternal life, and which covers the sins that erewhile had clung to our weakness" (Melancthon). In this life of faith "we taste the powers of the world to come," "our citizenship is in heaven." "This eternal life is a veritable resurrection of the dead" (Augustine). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
