The Passover meal commemorates the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. This context is significant because Jesus is about to become the ultimate Passover Lamb, sacrificed for the sins of humanity. The setting is a private upper room in Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish worship and prophecy. The meal is a time of fellowship and teaching, where Jesus imparts final instructions to His disciples.<p><b>and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas,</b><br>This indicates the spiritual battle taking place behind the scenes. The devil, or Satan, is portrayed as the adversary of God and His purposes. The phrase suggests a premeditated plan, as Satan influences Judas to betray Jesus. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of spiritual warfare, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are reminded that their struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces of evil.<p><b>the son of Simon Iscariot,</b><br>Judas Iscariot is identified by his father's name, Simon, which was a common practice to distinguish individuals in biblical times. The name "Iscariot" likely refers to Judas's place of origin, possibly Kerioth in Judea, setting him apart from the other disciples who were mostly from Galilee. This geographical detail highlights Judas's unique position among the Twelve and may suggest differing cultural influences.<p><b>to betray Jesus.</b><br>The act of betrayal fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend lifting his heel against the psalmist, a foreshadowing of Judas's actions. Betrayal is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with treachery and the breaking of trust. Judas's betrayal is pivotal in the Passion narrative, leading to Jesus's arrest and crucifixion, which are central to the Christian understanding of redemption and atonement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is about to demonstrate servant leadership by washing the disciples' feet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples, known for betraying Jesus.

The fact is recorded hero to explain the references to Judas which follow in our Lord's words (<a href="/john/13-10.htm" title="Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all.">John 13:10</a>; <a href="/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>; <a href="/john/13-21.htm" title="When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.">John 13:21</a>; <a href="/context/john/13-26.htm" title="Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.

The idea came from the devil, but the purpose of the devil was not irrevocable. The evangelist looked through his tears of love to the traitor's face as he sat at meat, and felt how the very excess and uttermost and hyperbole of love was reached and scaled by the contact between the treachery of the one and the Divine humiliation of the other. The contrast between these two mental states is one of the most striking antitheses in the Gospel. But how should John know that Judas had already plotted the betrayal of his Master?
