This is significant in the context of <a href="/john/12.htm">John 12</a>, where Greeks seek Jesus. Philip's decision to consult Andrew, another apostle with a Greek name, indicates a thoughtful approach to the request. This reflects the early church's mission to reach beyond Jewish boundaries, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles. The partnership between Philip and Andrew highlights the importance of collaboration in ministry.<p><b>and both of them went and told Jesus</b><br>The act of both apostles going to Jesus underscores the importance of direct communication with Christ in matters of spiritual significance. It reflects the disciples' recognition of Jesus as the ultimate authority and source of wisdom. This moment is pivotal, as it precedes Jesus' discourse on His impending death and the glorification of the Son of Man, which is central to the Gospel's message. The involvement of both apostles also illustrates the communal nature of the early Christian movement, where decisions and revelations were shared experiences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles of Jesus, originally from Bethsaida.

The Greeks&#8217; appeal is an early glimpse of this drawing power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Andrew</b><p>&#8211; Andrew often plays the role of bringing people to Jesus: his brother Peter (<a href="/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41&#8211;42</a>) and the boy with five loaves and two fish (<a href="/john/6-8.htm">John 6:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8211; Pairing with Andrew suggests accountability and discernment; together they can confirm the appropriateness of the request (cf. <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>, &#8220;plans succeed through a multitude of counselors&#8221;).<p>&#8211; The teamwork avoids any hint of favoritism and keeps the focus on Jesus&#8217; priorities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both of them</b><p>&#8211; Unity in service: Philip and Andrew move as a united front. Jesus sent disciples out two by two (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>), underlining the safety and strength found in partnership.<p>&#8211; Working together also removes personal agendas; it&#8217;s about faithfully representing Christ&#8217;s interests, not individual preferences (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went and told Jesus</b><p>&#8211; They do not grant the Greeks direct access on their own terms; they go straight to the Lord, acknowledging His authority over every encounter.<p>&#8211; This mirrors the pattern of prayer: carrying the needs of others directly to Jesus (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>).<p>&#8211; By placing the matter before Him, they model reliance on Jesus&#8217; timing and wisdom, anticipating His response in <a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23&#8211;26</a> where He speaks of His impending glorification.<p>&#8211; Their action underscores that Jesus alone decides how and when He will reveal Himself (<a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>; <a href="/john/7-6.htm">John 7:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/12-22.htm">John 12:22</a> showcases humble, cooperative discipleship. Philip hears the Greeks&#8217; request, involves Andrew, and together they bring the matter to Jesus. Their teamwork safeguards against self-centered ministry and points every seeker straight to the Savior, letting Him determine the next steps in God&#8217;s unfolding plan to draw all peoples to Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew.</span>--It is a striking coincidence, and perhaps more than this, that the Greeks thus came into connection with the only Apostles who bear Greek names; and may themselves have had some special connection by birth, or residence, or culture with Greek civilisation. The names have occurred together before (<a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>; <a href="/context/john/6-7.htm" title="Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.">John 6:7-8</a>): they were fellow-townsmen and friends. But Andrew was also brother of Simon Peter, and is one of the first group of four in the apostolic band. (Comp. <a href="/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>.) The Greeks then naturally come to Philip, and Philip consults his friend Andrew, who is in a position of greater intimacy with the Lord than he himself is, and they come together and tell Jesus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The slight modification of text preferred by the Revised Version gives great vivacity to the picture (see below, note 1). Philip receives the respectful request of the Greeks, "Sir [my lord], we would see Jesus," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "converse with." They probably sought to bring some proposal before him. Surely they must have had, if they wished it, many opportunities of merely <span class="accented">seeing</span> Jesus, when he crossed the Mount of Olivet during those three days, or tarried in the court of the Gentiles; now they pressed for an interview. <span class="cmt_word">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew.</span> Andrew was the earliest of the disciples, who brought his own brother Simon to Jesus (<a href="/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40-42</a>). He is mentioned as in close association with Simon, James, and John, as partners with them in the fishing-trade on the lake of Galilee (see <a href="/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16, 29</a>, and Mark 3:18, compared with <a href="/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). There is some hint that Andrew and John, after the first call to become followers of Christ, clung to him, and went with him to Jerusalem, and then returned with him through Samaria, after which occurred the second call of the brothers <span class="accented">Simon</span> and <span class="accented">James</span>. The frequent references to Andrew and Philip in this Gospel correspond with the tradition preserved in the <span class="accented">Muratorian Fragment on the Canon</span>, touching Andrew's part in the composition of this Gospel. These two disciples are represented as consulting with each other on previous occasions, as though peculiarly related in sympathy. Philip sees certain difficulties, and Andrew has a practical mind, and proposes a way out of them (see <a href="/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7, 8</a>). There was something now to be said on both sides. Their ancient prophecies anticipated a world-wide aspect of the Messianic kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4, 5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3, 7</a>; as well as <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). Now, if this incident occurred after Jesus had claimed the hundred and tenth psalm as an oracle which described his own Divine claims and his universal victory as the Lord and Son of David and royal Warrior-Prest (<a href="/matthew/22-41.htm">Matthew 22:41-46</a>, and parallel passages), Philip may have felt this moment to be a most critical one in his history; for he may have been perfectly aware of the outbreak of peril which converse with Greek proselytes might at that moment have provoked in the minds of the turbulent populace. <span class="cmt_word">Andrew cometh and Philip, and they</span> (together) <span class="cmt_word">tell Jesus</span>. Jesus alone could solve the difficulty at that time, and Jesus himself is the just and reasonable Source of all enlightenment. Jesus is at this hour the highest Expression of man and his destiny, and he is also the perfect Manifestation of the Father, the only Mediator between God and man, absolutely one with both. We still go to him to know what God is and what God would have us to think and to be, and to learn what man may become. We take to him the puzzles of our logic, the accusations of our conscience, and the burdens of our heart. Additional interest is thrown round this narrative by a suggestion of Archdeacon Watkins, that, in the course of this week, our Lord had cleansed the temple and courts of its profane traffic, and declared it to be a <span class="accented">house of prayer for all nations</span>. Such grand revolutionary conceptions as those of our Lord must have deeply stirred the souls of the susceptible Greeks. Aliens were, as we know from Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:11.5), forbidden to pass beyond the balustrade round the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,. M.
