It suggests a chronological sequence, though the exact time lapse is not specified. The phrase sets the stage for a new event in Jesus' ministry, emphasizing the ongoing nature of His work and mission.<p><b>Jesus crossed to the other side</b><br>This movement signifies a deliberate action by Jesus, often seen in the Gospels as a way to reach different groups of people or to find solitude. Crossing the sea was a common means of travel in the region, highlighting Jesus' itinerant ministry. It also foreshadows the miraculous events that often occur when Jesus is near water, such as walking on water or calming storms.<p><b>of the Sea of Galilee</b><br>The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Gennesaret, is a freshwater lake in the region of Galilee. It is central to many of Jesus' miracles and teachings. The area around the Sea of Galilee was densely populated and a hub of commerce and fishing, making it a strategic location for Jesus' ministry. The sea is surrounded by hills, which can cause sudden storms, adding to the dramatic nature of events that occur there.<p><b>(that is, the Sea of Tiberias)</b><br>This parenthetical note provides a Roman name for the Sea of Galilee, reflecting the influence of Roman culture and governance in the region. Tiberias was a city on the western shore of the lake, named after the Roman Emperor Tiberius. This dual naming indicates the cultural and political context of the time, where Jewish and Roman influences coexisted. It also highlights the Gospel's audience, which included both Jewish and Gentile readers who would recognize different names for the same location.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_galilee.htm">Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>A freshwater lake in Israel, also known as the Sea of Tiberias, significant for many of Jesus' teachings and miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_other_side.htm">The Other Side</a></b><br>Refers to the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus often withdrew with His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_intentional_movement.htm">Jesus' Intentional Movement</a></b><br>Jesus' crossing to the other side of the Sea of Galilee demonstrates His intentionality in ministry.

Chronological difficulties beset our treatment of this miraculous narrative with its varied consequences and results. Many curious and even violent measures have been resorted to with a view to solve them. Some have supposed that ch. 5. and 6. have been inverted in order, and that thus the presence of our Lord in Galilee, mentioned in ch. 4, would account for the statement of ch. 6:1 and the journey to Jerusalem of ch. 5:1, be brought into closer relation with ch. 7. We cannot see the faintest indication or evidence whatever of any such treatment of the Gospel by the authors of the manuscripts or the quotations or versions. The evangelist has just completed his record of the conflict between Jesus and the recognized leaders of the people in Jerusalem. He had introduced our Lord's own vindication (based on the highest grounds) of his own right to deal with the rabbinical restrictions upon sabbath duty. These grounds were the eternal relations of his own inner nature and consciousness with the Father's. On no occasion had Christ made the uniqueness of his personal claims and powers more explicit. He called for entire obedience to his word as the condition of eternal life, and as the key to the Scriptures of God. If we had no synoptic tradition to give a closer historical setting of the narrative which here follows, we might take Meyer's view, and say that the "after these things" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) of ver. 1 referred to the discourse of the previous chapter, and that the "departed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) referred to Jerusalem as its starting point; and, notwithstanding the extreme awkwardness of the expression, we might have supposed that "the other side" of the sea was the other side of it from Jerusalem (cf. <a href="/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40</a>; <a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>). Some commentators appear to have a morbid fear of reducing a difficulty, or seeing a harmony, between these four narratives. One thing is dear, that they are independent of one another, are not derived from each other, do each involve side views of the event distinct from the rest, and yet concur in the same general representation. The synoptists, however, place the "feeding of the multitudes" in the midst of a group of most remarkable and varied events. It is for them one page out of many descriptive of the Galilaean ministry, and which ultimately led to grievous departure from and diminution of the temporary popularity of the great Prophet. It would seem that bitter hostility, as well as excited enthusiasm, was checkering his early ministry. The synoptics take pains to show the combined effect of his self-revelations <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> on his own fellow townsmen (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>; <a href="/mark/6-1.htm">Mark 6:1-6</a>);  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(tauta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">crossed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_565.htm">Strong's 565: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and erchomai; to go off, aside or behind, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the other side</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(peran)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4008.htm">Strong's 4008: </a> </span><span class="str2">Over, on the other side, beyond.
