It is a solemn affirmation, indicating that the following statement is of great significance. This double affirmation is unique to the Gospel of John and underscores the authority of Jesus' words.<p><b>when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted</b><br>This part of the verse reflects the freedom and independence associated with youth. In the cultural context of the time, dressing oneself and choosing one's path were symbols of autonomy and self-determination. This imagery is used to contrast the later loss of freedom that comes with age or circumstances beyond one's control.<p><b>but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands</b><br>The phrase "stretch out your hands" is often interpreted as a metaphor for crucifixion, a form of execution that was common in the Roman Empire. This imagery foreshadows Peter's martyrdom, as tradition holds that he was crucified in Rome. The stretching out of hands can also symbolize submission and vulnerability, as one is led by others.<p><b>and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.</b><br>This indicates a loss of personal freedom and control, suggesting that Peter will face circumstances beyond his choosing. Historically, this is understood as a prophecy of Peter's death, where he would be led to a place of execution against his will. Theologically, it reflects the cost of discipleship and the ultimate surrender to God's will, even unto death. This prophecy is fulfilled in the tradition that Peter was martyred for his faith, highlighting the theme of sacrifice and commitment in following Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who is speaking to Peter, providing him with a prophecy about his future.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter (Simon Peter)</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, who is being addressed directly by Jesus in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_galilee.htm">The Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>The location where Jesus appears to His disciples after His resurrection, as described earlier in <a href="/bsb/john/21.htm">John 21</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The broader context in which this prophecy would be fulfilled, as Peter becomes a leading figure in the early Christian community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/martyrdom.htm">Martyrdom</a></b><br>The event foreshadowed by Jesus in this verse, indicating the manner of Peter's death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophecy.htm">Understanding Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' words to Peter remind us that God knows our future and has a plan for our lives, even if it involves suffering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_following_christ.htm">Faithfulness in Following Christ</a></b><br>Peter's journey from denial to martyrdom illustrates the transformative power of Christ's love and forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Jesus' prophecy to Peter highlights the reality that following Christ may lead to personal sacrifice and suffering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/embracing_god's_will.htm">Embracing God's Will</a></b><br>Like Peter, we are called to trust in God's plan for our lives, even when it leads us into difficult circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faith.htm">Legacy of Faith</a></b><br>Peter's life and death serve as a powerful testimony to the enduring impact of a life fully committed to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_21_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 21:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_21_18_Cost_of_discipleship.htm">How does John 21:18 illustrate the cost of discipleship in your life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_when_old_for_Peter_s_path.htm">What does "when you are old" signify about Peter's future and faith journey?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_21_18_inspire_trust.htm">How can John 21:18 inspire you to trust God's plan for your future?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/John_21_18_vs_Matt_16_24_Self-denial.htm">Compare John 21:18 with Matthew 16:24.

He wants Peter&#8212;and us&#8212;to bank on every word. The same double &#8220;truly&#8221; frames pivotal teachings elsewhere (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; 5:24), underscoring that what follows is neither guesswork nor mere advice; it is certain, coming from the One who is &#8220;the way and the truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). When the risen Lord speaks with that gravity, we are invited to listen with absolute trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when you were young, you dressed yourself</b><p>The Lord recalls Peter&#8217;s earlier years of independence. He chose his own clothes, set his own agenda, and often acted impulsively (<a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28-31</a>; <a href="/john/13-8.htm">John 13:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Youthful freedom pictures self-reliance.<p>&#8226; Jesus reminds Peter of the contrast between self-directed days and Spirit-directed future ministry (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14-41</a>).<p>By highlighting the past, Jesus points to Peter&#8217;s growth from self-confidence to Christ-dependence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and walked where you wanted;</b><p>Peter once roamed fishing villages, synagogues, and even storm-tossed seas at will. Yet the Gospel had already begun redirecting his steps: &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Peter determined his own paths; soon, obedience would determine them (<a href="/acts/9-32.htm">Acts 9:32-43</a>).<p>&#8226; This line prepares him to surrender personal preference for kingdom purpose (<a href="/john/13-36.htm">John 13:36-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands,</b><p>Here Jesus foretells martyrdom. &#8220;Stretch out your hands&#8221; evokes the posture of crucifixion and the helplessness of a prisoner (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32-33</a>). Decades later Peter writes, &#8220;I know that I will soon put off my tabernacle, just as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-14.htm">2 Peter 1:14</a>), confirming he understood the prediction literally.<p>&#8226; God does not hide the cost of discipleship (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>).<p>&#8226; He also honors His servants with foreknowledge, enabling them to prepare in faith (<a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and someone else will dress you</b><p>Unlike youthful self-dressing, chains and guards will bind Peter. A glimpse appears in <a href="/acts/12-6.htm">Acts 12:6-7</a>, where soldiers fasten him between them.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows loss of personal control; yet God remains in control (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Even forced clothing&#8212;whether prison garb or burial linen&#8212;cannot strip away the robe of Christ&#8217;s righteousness (<a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and lead you where you do not want to go.</b><p>Peter once vowed to follow Jesus anywhere (<a href="/john/13-37.htm">John 13:37</a>), but martyrdom would press that vow beyond preference. The path would be painful, yet purposeful: &#8220;By this He signified by what kind of death he would glorify God&#8221; (<a href="/john/21-19.htm">John 21:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Suffering can be unwelcome, yet it still glorifies God when endured in faith (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The Shepherd who leads beside quiet waters (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>) is the same Shepherd who appoints our final steps, ensuring they serve His glory and our ultimate good (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus contrasts Peter&#8217;s youthful freedom with his later martyrdom to show the shift from self-reliance to Spirit-empowered obedience. Every detail&#8212;spoken with double &#8220;truly&#8221;&#8212;is certain: Peter will lose personal control, be bound by others, and die a death that magnifies God. The passage reminds believers that following Christ includes both joyful service and costly surrender, yet every step, even one we &#8220;do not want to go,&#8221; is held in the sovereign hands of the Lord who loves us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Verily, verily, I say unto thee.</span>--This phrase is peculiar to St. John.

Peter must have been at this time (comp. <a href="/matthew/8-14.htm" title="And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.">Matthew 8:14</a>) in middle age.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee.</span>--Do these words refer to the crucifixion of Peter? Tradition, from Tertullian downwards (<span class= "ital">Scorp.</span> xv.; <span class= "ital">De Praescr.</span> xxxv.), states that he was crucified, and, interpreting this prophecy by the event, asserts that they do. Tertullian himself so understood them, for he says, "Then is Peter girded by another when he is bound to the cross."<p>But on the other hand, (1) the girding (with chains) would precede, not follow, the crucifixion; (2) it would be more natural to speak of another stretching forth his hands if the nailing them to the cross is intended; (3) the last clause, "carry thee whither thou wouldest not," could not follow the stretching of the hands on the transverse beam of the cross.<p>It seems impossible therefore to adopt the traditional reference to crucifixion, and we must take the words, "stretch forth thy hands," as expressing symbolically the personal surrender previous to being girded by another. To what exact form of death the context does not specify. We have thus in the second pair of sentences, as in the first and third, a complete parallelism, the stretching forth of the hands being a part of the girding by another, and the whole being in contrast to "Thou girdedst thyself." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto thee</span>. This form of address links the pre-resurrection life to that which follows, proclaims the identity of the being and the unity of the Person of the Christ under new conditions. More than that, much solemnity is conferred on this final word of the Master. <span class="cmt_word">When thou wast younger than thou art now</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before thou camest under my sway; when thou wert supreme ruler of the fishing-fleet of Capernaum, with wife and family dependent on thee; when Andrew, James, and John (thy partners) were in a measure all doing thy will, following in thy train, submitting to thy behests, - <span class="cmt_word">thou girdodst thyself</span> for whatever task was set before thee; thou hadst the choice of duties and pleasures; thou hadst time at thy disposal, thy method of service in thine own hands, even as now it was thy will to gird thee for the task of swimming to my feet (see <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-17.htm">Proverbs 31:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4, 5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35-37</a>; <a href="/luke/17-8.htm">Luke 17:8</a>; <a href="/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The simple verb is used here in reference to all kinds of "girding"). So that the Lord reminds him of his natural self-will, so conspicuous and prominent, the secret of all his weakness and much of his individuality. <span class="cmt_word">And thou walkedst whither thou wouldest</span>; or literally, thou wert in the habit of walking whithersoever thou weft willing or desiring to do; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thine outward conduct, and the whole line of thy daily enterprise and duty, was not only an utterance of thine own self-mastery, but even thy wishes, the momentary waywardness of thy purposes, found immediate gratification. But a great change has come over thee; thou hast passed through a new experience. Already thou feelest that thou art not thine own; thy heart and strength, thy hands, thy feet, thy very girdle and sandal, are beginning to seem to thee no longer at thine own disposal. Thy self-will is checked, thy natural audacity and power of initiation are repressed into much narrower limits. Thou-hast found thyself weaker than a little child; thou art in need of this Divine principle of "love," deep and fervent, reverential as well as personal, not only to utter bold expressions of regard, but to form the very focus and new central force of thy whole being; and so it will come to pass that this new force will more than master thee; and <span class="cmt_word">when thou shalt be</span> old and gray with years, thy service to that other and higher wilt shall be complete: thou <span class="cmt_word">wilt stretch forth thy hands</span> in token of entire submission to the will of another, however it may be revealed to thee - whether at the instance of "the angel" or "Herod," of "Cornelius" or Nero's executioner! This remarkable phrase has often been supposed to mean the "stretching forth of the hands of the crucified" on his being appended to the cross. But such a process would follow rather than precede the "girding," which is, on such an interpretation, taken literally of the girding that preceded the nailing. There can be no doubt, from the language of St. John, that this was the final and forcible illustration of the new principle that would take full possession of Simon Peter. But meanwhile it was a long life of willing surrender to the Supreme Will which gives its highest meaning to these words. <span class="cmt_word">And another shall gird thee, and carry thee</span>(or, bring thee) <span class="cmt_word">whither thou art not wishing to go</span>. The old self-will, though it be indeed mastered, will not have utterly vanished. If it be not so, where would be the sacrifice? Even the blessed Lord himself said, "Not my will, but thine be done." Verily, even the sanctified nature of the sinless Man, prepared in the spotless womb of the blessed Virgin by the Holy Ghost, anointed by the Spirit, and in living absolute union with the only begotten Son, - even he was, in human consciousness, disposed to cry, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me," etc. We need not wonder, then, that to the very last, when the supreme will was manifested to Peter in the approaches of violent death, he should feel the will of the flesh thwarted. The exquisite legend embodied in the "Domiue, quo vadis?" (see <a href="/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>) confirms the entire representation of the character of Peter. So also does the story, preserved by Tertullian ('De Pries.,' 35; ' Ad Scorp.,' 15) and Eusebius ('Hist. Eccl.,' 3:1), that the apostle preferred crucifixion with his head downwards, on the plea that to be crucified as his Master was too great an honor for one that had denied his Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(soi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
