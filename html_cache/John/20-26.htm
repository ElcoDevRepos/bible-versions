In Jewish reckoning, "eight days" includes the starting day, making it a week later, on the following Sunday. This timing emphasizes the importance of the first day of the week in early Christian worship, reflecting the resurrection's significance.<p><b>His disciples were once again inside</b><br>The disciples are gathered indoors, likely in the same upper room where they had previously met. This setting suggests a place of safety and fellowship, as they were still processing the events of Jesus' death and resurrection. The gathering of the disciples highlights the early formation of the Christian community.<p><b>with the doors locked</b><br>The locked doors indicate the disciples' fear of persecution from Jewish authorities, as they were followers of Jesus, who had been crucified. This detail underscores the tension and danger faced by the early Christians and sets the stage for the miraculous nature of Jesus' appearance.<p><b>and Thomas was with them</b><br>Thomas, also known as Didymus, was absent during Jesus' first post-resurrection appearance. His presence here is significant because he had expressed doubt about Jesus' resurrection, insisting on physical proof. This sets up the narrative for Jesus addressing Thomas' skepticism directly.<p><b>Jesus came and stood among them</b><br>Despite the locked doors, Jesus' sudden appearance demonstrates His glorified, resurrected body, which transcends physical barriers. This miraculous entry reinforces His divine nature and the reality of His resurrection, providing comfort and assurance to the disciples.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Peace be with you.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' greeting of peace, "Shalom," is both a traditional Jewish salutation and a profound declaration of the peace He brings through His victory over sin and death.

There is no reason for thinking that they had not met together during the interval, and that their meeting was a special observance of the Lord's Day. At the same time this appearance on the recurrence of the first day of the week would take its place among the steps by which the disciples passed from the observance of the Jewish Sabbath to that of the Christian Sunday.<p>The place is obviously the same as that of the first appearance, and the doors are shut for the same reason. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>.)<p>The repetition of the greeting, <span class= "ital">"</span>Peace be unto you," is partly the natural salutation as He appears to them, but now indeed full of a new meaning, which the thoughts of the week must have written upon their hearts, and partly, it may be, is specially intended <span class= "ital">to</span> include Thomas, who was not present when it was spoken before.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after eight days</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after the Passover week was over, during which the disciples were pondering the new revelations of the Easter Day, and becoming more able to understand the meaning of a spiritual presence - to understand what the real "touching" of the risen Lord meant - <span class="cmt_word">again his disciples were within</span> the same or a similar abode referred to in ver. 19. Some have urged that this manifestation occurred in Galilee, whither the disciples had been directed to journey to receive the most convincing proofs of his power and presence. There is no evidence of this at all, and the form of expression corresponds so closely with the description of the conditions of the first meeting, that we cannot accept the suggestion of Olshausen and others. Some have urged that this is the beginning of the celebration of the Resurrection-day - the sanctification of the first day of the week. Such a conclusion cannot be positively asserted. "Eight days" having fully elapsed might bring them to the evening of the second day of the second week. The expression, "seven days," is unquestionably used for a week in the Old Testament, though Luke (<a href="/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28</a>) seems to use the expression, "about eight days," for a well-known division of time, probably "from sabbath to sabbath;" and from the Jewish way of reckoning the beginning of a day on the sunset of the preceding day, we might reckon that, from the middle of the first Sunday to the evening of the second, the period would include parts of eight days. There is nothing, therefore, to prevent the calculation of parts of eight days from the great events of Easter Day as a whole to the evening of the second Sunday. And though, as Meyer says, there is nothing indicative of any consecration of the first day of the week, it is obviously calculated to explain the custom which so rapidly sprang up in the Christian community. Nor is it without interest that John, in the Apocalypse, described himself as receiving his first great vision on "the Lord's day." <span class="cmt_word">And Thomas was with them</span>. He had not broken with the disciples, even if he could not accept their unanimous testimony. He was now, at least, sharing their excitement, and perhaps their hope, and many in addition to the eleven disciples were striving to realize with them the new condition of things, even their common relation to an invisible and triumphant Lord. The Gospel of Matthew and the undisputed portion of <a href="/mark/16.htm">Mark 16</a>. describe no appearance to the apostles in Jerusalem, and consequently the opponents of the Fourth Gospel have commented on the apostles' cowardly flight from Jerusalem, and on the unhistoric character of the two appearances to them in the metropolis. The fact is that there is no indication of flight in the synoptists, and the Fourth Gospel throws light on the return to Galilee in <a href="/john/21.htm">John 21</a>. (see Weiss, 'Life of Jesus,' vol. 3:403, 404). Matthew gives rather a summary of the appearances of forty days (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>), in an event to which probably St. Paul refers (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When the doors had been shut</span> (observe here and in ver. 19 the perfect passive participle), <span class="cmt_word">Jesus cometh, and stood in the midst, and said</span> (once more, as he saw their natural perturbation; for do not men always shrink from manifestation of pure spirit or spiritual body?), <span class="cmt_word">Peace be unto you</span> (see notes on vers. 19, 20). The repetition of the appearance at a similar hour and place confirmed and intensified their previous experience. If doubts had crept into any minds, the rectification of the first impression would be secured, and a Divine joy once more surcharge their minds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Eight</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8000;&#954;&#964;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(okt&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3638.htm">Strong's 3638: </a> </span><span class="str2">Eight.
