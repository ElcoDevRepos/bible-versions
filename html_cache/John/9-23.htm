The Pharisees, skeptical of this miracle, interrogate the man and his parents. The parents' response is cautious, reflecting the social and religious pressures of the time. The Jewish leaders had already decided that anyone confessing Jesus as the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue (<a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>). This fear of excommunication highlights the tension between the early followers of Jesus and the established religious authorities. The parents' statement is a strategic move to avoid conflict with the Pharisees.<p><b>&#8220;He is old enough.</b><br>The phrase indicates that the man was of age to speak for himself, suggesting he was at least 13 years old, the age of religious maturity in Jewish culture, known as Bar Mitzvah. This cultural detail underscores the parents' attempt to distance themselves from the controversy, placing the responsibility of testimony on their son. It also reflects the Jewish legal principle that an adult is responsible for their own testimony.<p><b>Ask him.&#8221;</b><br>By directing the Pharisees to their son, the parents avoid making a direct statement about Jesus, thus protecting themselves from potential repercussions. This response is a reflection of the fear and division that Jesus' ministry caused among the Jewish people. It also emphasizes the personal nature of faith and testimony, as each individual must confront the truth of Jesus' identity. The man's willingness to testify about his healing contrasts with his parents' reluctance, highlighting the transformative impact of encountering Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was born blind and healed by Jesus, central to the account of <a href="/bsb/john/9.htm">John 9</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parents.htm">The Parents</a></b><br>The parents of the man born blind, who are questioned by the Pharisees about their son's healing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders who are skeptical of Jesus and investigate the healing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, who performs the miracle of healing the blind man.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>The place of Jewish worship and community, where the parents feared being expelled from due to their association with Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_man_vs._fear_of_god.htm">Fear of Man vs. Fear of God</a></b><br>The parents' fear of the Pharisees highlights the struggle between fearing human authority and standing firm in faith.
