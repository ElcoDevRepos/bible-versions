The context is the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, where Jesus was teaching. The "many" refers to a significant portion of the Jewish leaders and possibly some of the crowd. This division is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John, highlighting the varied responses to Jesus' ministry.<p><b>He is demon-possessed</b><br>Accusations of demon possession were not uncommon in the ancient world, especially when someone exhibited behavior or teachings that were considered radical or threatening to the established order. In the Gospels, Jesus is accused multiple times of being under demonic influence (e.g., <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>, <a href="/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22</a>). This reflects the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart of those who opposed Him, unable to recognize His divine authority and power.<p><b>and insane</b><br>The charge of insanity suggests that Jesus' teachings and claims were perceived as irrational or beyond comprehension. In the cultural context, mental illness was often misunderstood and stigmatized. The accusation of insanity also serves to discredit Jesus' message, as it implies that His words should not be taken seriously. This reflects the tension between human understanding and divine revelation.<p><b>Why would you listen to Him?</b><br>This rhetorical question is meant to dissuade others from following Jesus. It reflects the leaders' fear of losing influence and control over the people. The question also underscores the challenge of faith, as listening to Jesus requires discernment and openness to the truth He reveals. This echoes the broader theme in John of hearing and recognizing the voice of the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3-4, 27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, whose teachings and miracles are the subject of debate and division among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish leaders and people who were divided in their opinion about Jesus, some accusing Him of being demon-possessed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, a significant location for Jewish religious life and the backdrop for much of Jesus' ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_dedication.htm">Feast of Dedication (Hanukkah)</a></b><br>The context in which this discussion occurs, a time when many Jews gathered in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/demon-possession.htm">Demon-possession</a></b><br>A term used by some of the Jews to describe Jesus, reflecting their misunderstanding and rejection of His divine nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/misunderstanding_of_jesus'_identity.htm">Misunderstanding of Jesus' Identity</a></b><br>Many people, even today, misunderstand who Jesus is.

The pattern fulfills <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;He was despised and rejected by men.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a> and <a href="/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22</a> reveal the same tactic: attributing Christ&#8217;s works to demonic power rather than acknowledging divine authority.<p>&#8226; Such claims ignore the evident goodness Jesus displayed in healing the blind man (<a href="/bsb/john/9.htm">John 9</a>) and in offering eternal life (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>).<p>&#8226; By labeling Him insane, they dismissed both His miracles and His teaching, contrary to the testimony of <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>, &#8220;Taste and see that the LORD is good.&#8221;<p>The literal wording underscores a tragic irony: the One they call mad is perfect holiness in human flesh.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why would you listen to Him?&#8221;</b><p>The scoffers not only reject Jesus for themselves but seek to silence His voice for others.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> states, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge,&#8221; yet unbelief treats divine wisdom as folly.<p>&#8226; Jesus had just said, &#8220;My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).

The literal charge to stop listening only highlights the power of Christ&#8217;s words that still draw hearts today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/10-20.htm">John 10:20</a> records an authentic moment of resistance: some listeners brand Jesus demon-possessed and insane and urge others to stop listening. Their reaction fulfills Scripture&#8217;s portrayal of hardened hearts while contrasting sharply with the promise that Jesus&#8217; true sheep will hear His voice.
