As an eyewitness to the events of Jesus' crucifixion, John provides a firsthand account, which is crucial for establishing the credibility of the narrative. In the context of Jewish law, the testimony of an eyewitness was highly valued (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). John's presence at the crucifixion is also supported by his mention in <a href="/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26-27</a>, where Jesus entrusts the care of His mother to him.<p><b>and his testimony is true</b><br>The emphasis on the truthfulness of the testimony underscores the reliability of the Gospel account. In a historical context, the early church faced various heresies and false teachings, making the affirmation of truth essential. This statement aligns with the broader biblical theme of truth, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life." The insistence on truth also reflects the Johannine theme of light versus darkness, where truth is associated with light.<p><b>He knows that he is telling the truth</b><br>This phrase highlights the confidence and certainty of the eyewitness. It suggests an intimate knowledge and conviction about the events described. In a cultural context, the assurance of truth was vital for the early Christian community, which relied on the apostles' teachings as the foundation of their faith. This assurance is echoed in 1 <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where the author speaks of proclaiming what was seen and heard.<p><b>so that you also may believe</b><br>The purpose of the testimony is evangelistic, aiming to lead others to faith in Jesus Christ. This aligns with the overall purpose of the Gospel of John, as stated in <a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>: "But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name." The call to belief is central to the Christian message, emphasizing faith as the means of receiving eternal life. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of salvation history, where belief in God's promises is a recurring theme, as seen in the faith of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_witness.htm">The Witness</a></b><br>The "one who saw it" refers to the Apostle John, the author of the Gospel.

He is not repeating rumor; he &#8220;saw&#8221; the soldier pierce Jesus&#8217; side and the blood and water flow (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>).<p>&#8226; The same writer later says, &#8220;This is the disciple who testifies to these things and wrote them down&#8221; (<a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>).<p>&#8226; His language echoes <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-3</a>, where he reminds believers he has &#8220;seen with our eyes&#8230;touched with our hands.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By stepping forward in the first person, John satisfies the biblical requirement for eyewitness confirmation (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>) and anchors the crucifixion details in verifiable history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his testimony is true.</b><p>John insists on the reliability of what he records.<p>&#8226; Jesus had already said, &#8220;You sent to John, and he has testified to the truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>); now the apostle bears that same mantle of truthful witness.<p>&#8226; Peter uses similar language: &#8220;We did not follow cleverly devised myths&#8230;but were eyewitnesses of His majesty&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement guards the church against later claims that the cross event was symbolic or spiritual only; the facts occurred exactly as written.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He knows that he is telling the truth,</b><p>John appeals to his own conscious certainty.<p>&#8226; Like Luke, who wrote &#8220;having carefully investigated everything from the beginning&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>), John writes with settled conviction.<p>&#8226; The wording underscores personal responsibility: if he were exaggerating, God would hold him accountable (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a> notes that Jesus presented Himself &#8220;with many convincing proofs&#8221;; John offers one of those proofs&#8212;the flow of blood and water&#8212;to show Jesus truly died, countering any future claim that He merely swooned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you also may believe.</b><p>The purpose moves from John&#8217;s certainty to the reader&#8217;s faith.<p>&#8226;

Faith is always built on God-given evidence (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>); eyewitness testimony is part of that evidence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/5-10.htm">1 John 5:10-13</a> links believing the testimony about the Son to possessing eternal life&#8212;exactly what John desires for his readers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a> is more than a footnote; it is a solemn certification. The apostle, standing at the cross, affirms with absolute honesty that Jesus truly died, that his record is historically accurate, and that these verified facts are written so every reader can confidently place personal faith in the crucified and risen Son of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/1-7.htm" title="The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.">John 1:7</a>. It may be better to render the word here, as elsewhere, by "witness," in order that we may get the full force of its frequent recurrence. The writer speaks of himself in the third person (comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 375), laying stress upon the specially important fact that it was an eye-witness--"he that saw it"--who testified to the fact, and one who therefore knew it to be true. The word rendered "true" in this clause is the emphatic word for "ideally true," which is familiar to the readers of this Gospel. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>.) It answers to the idea of what evidence should be, because it is the evidence of one who himself saw what he witnesses.<p><span class= "bld">And he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</span>--The witness was ideally true, and therefore the things witnessed were actually true. He cannot doubt this, and he testifies it in order that others may find in these truths ground for, and the confirmation of, their faith.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath seen hath borne</span>, and is now bearing, herein and hereby, <span class="cmt_word">witness, and his witness is veritable</span> - the highest and surest kind of witness, that of direct observation, staggering, confounding the ordinary sense, but proving that the Son of God died in his human body - <span class="cmt_word">and he knoweth, by his own inward experience, that he saith true things, that ye also</span> <span class="cmt_word">may believe</span>. A vehement effort has been made to sever this testimony from the evangelist, and refer it to a third person <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and suppose that it took place during John's absence from the cross (so Weisse, Schweizer, Hilgenfeld, and others); but, as Meyer, Godet, etc., affirm there is no necessity whatever for such an interpretation. <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used of the subject of the sentence when it is clear from the context that the speaker himself is that subject (see <a href="/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a>). Concerning a third person, the writer could not have written, "He knoweth that he saith true things, that ye may believe," but rather, "We know that he saith true things, that we may believe." But John here speaks strongly of his own invincible conviction, and, as in <a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>, it is here given to induce a stronger faith on the part of his readers - not of himself and his readers in the supernatural death, in the signs that accompanied it, adapted to convince the bystanders of its marvel, and to fill up the prophetic picture, Hilgenfeld, with strange perversity, urges that the clever forger of the narrative "falls out of his part" and forgets himself (see Luthardt on 'Authorship of the Fourth Gospel,' p. 180). The symbolical and allegorical explanations are numerous. E.g. Toplady's well-known hymn, "Rock of Ages," contains the words - <p><span class="accented">"Let the water and the blood,<br />From thy riven side which flowed,<br />Be of sin the double cure,<br />Cleanse me from its guilt and power."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [one who]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
