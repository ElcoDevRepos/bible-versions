The father, a royal official, had approached Jesus in desperation for his son's healing. His realization marks a turning point from doubt to faith, highlighting the importance of personal experience in the journey of belief. This moment of realization is crucial in the narrative, as it signifies the transition from seeking a miracle to understanding the power and authority of Jesus.<p><b>that this was the very hour</b><br>The specific timing underscores the miraculous nature of the healing. It emphasizes Jesus' authority over time and space, as He was not physically present with the boy when the healing occurred. This detail connects to the broader theme of Jesus' divine nature, as seen in other instances where His words alone effect change (e.g., the healing of the centurion's servant in <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>).<p><b>in which Jesus had told him, &#8220;Your son will live.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' words are powerful and life-giving, reflecting His divine authority. This statement is a direct promise, showcasing Jesus' role as the giver of life, a theme consistent throughout the Gospel of John (e.g., <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the resurrection and the life). The fulfillment of Jesus' words here serves as a testament to His reliability and the truth of His promises.<p><b>And he and all his household believed.</b><br>The belief of the entire household signifies the communal impact of personal faith. In the cultural context of the time, the faith of a household head often influenced the entire family. This collective belief mirrors other instances in the New Testament where entire households come to faith (e.g., <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31-34</a> with the Philippian jailer).

Recognition turns information into conviction.<p>&#8226; Faith matures when we connect God&#8217;s promise with God&#8217;s timing. What seemed like coincidence becomes clear evidence of divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that this was the very hour</b><p>&#8226; The timing is precise: &#8220;Yesterday at the seventh hour&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-52.htm">John 4:52</a>). Jesus heals from miles away, proving His authority is not limited by distance (<a href="/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/8-8.htm">Matthew 8:8-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Such accuracy underlines Christ&#8217;s sovereignty over time itself (<a href="/john/11-6.htm">John 11:6, 14</a>-15). His words reach the need instantly, reminding us that delays may test faith but never hinder His power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in which Jesus had told him, &#8220;Your son will live.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The phrase echoes Jesus&#8217; life-giving proclamations elsewhere: &#8220;The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a>; cf. 6:63; 11:25-26).<p>&#8226; No ritual, touch, or visible sign&#8212;just a spoken promise. This scene anticipates countless believers who would later trust Christ&#8217;s word without seeing Him in person (<a href="/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; It spotlights the reliability of Scripture: what Jesus says, Jesus does, reinforcing our confidence to take Him at His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he and all his household believed</b><p>&#8226; The personal miracle becomes a family testimony.

The power he had felt when these words were spoken to him was real. The hours that had passed since, as he hastened to know all, had prepared him to read the sign. "Thy son liveth!" "The seventh hour yesterday!" There is more than one miracle here. A new life passes into his own spirit, and he, too, bound in the death-grasp of a formal religion, liveth! A Father's love has yearned for him. Christ has come down ere the child died.<p><span class= "bld">Himself believed.</span>--This is a yet higher faith. He believed the report before he went to Cana. He believed personally when he pleaded, "Lord, come down." He believed the word that Jesus spake when told to go his way, and every step of that road going away from the power to the sufferer was an act of faith; but still there is place for a fuller faith, and he and his household became believers. St. John traces here, as before, in the case of the Samaritans (<a href="/context/john/4-41.htm" title="And many more believed because of his own word;">John 4:41-42</a>), and of the disciples themselves (<a href="/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>), the successive development of faith.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The father then knew</span> (came to know, by putting the facts together) <span class="cmt_word">that his</span> <span class="cmt_word">son began to amend in the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Try son liveth.</span> The word was mighty, none other than that very voice of the Lord "which healeth all our diseases," and "redeemeth our lives from destruction." No mere coincidence, no common accident. <span class="cmt_word">And himself believed and his whole household;</span> believed in the Divine claims of Jesus. This is the earliest mention of "household faith" (cf. <a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>; <a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15, 34</a>). In this case a whole picture rises before our eye. The mother, the sisters, the servants, the entire family, had shared in the anxiety, had sympathized in the journey to Cana, and now accepted the exalted claims of Jesus. Faith is graciously contagious. The nearness of the unseen world often reveals the features of the God-Man.
