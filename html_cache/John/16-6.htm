Jesus is addressing the disciples' emotional response to His previous statements about His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit. The use of "instead" highlights the unexpected nature of their reaction compared to what might have been anticipated.<p><b>your hearts are filled with sorrow</b><br>The disciples' sorrow is profound, reflecting their deep attachment to Jesus and their lack of understanding of the necessity and benefits of His departure. This sorrow is not just emotional but spiritual, as they grapple with the implications of losing their Teacher and Lord. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of emotions, thoughts, and will, indicating that their entire being is affected.<p><b>because I have told you these things.</b><br>Jesus had been preparing His disciples for His impending crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. "These things" refer to the difficult truths He shared about His departure and the persecution they would face. The disciples' sorrow stems from their limited understanding of God's redemptive plan. This phrase connects to other scriptures where Jesus foretells His death and resurrection (e.g., <a href="/john/14.htm">John 14:1-3</a>, <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). It also points to the fulfillment of prophecy and the necessity of His sacrifice for the salvation of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples about His impending departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, they are experiencing sorrow due to Jesus' revelation about His departure.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting for this discourse, where Jesus shares His final teachings and prayers with His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context involves Jesus preparing the disciples for the coming of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place, significant as the location of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sorrow.htm">Understanding Sorrow</a></b><br>Recognize that sorrow is a natural response to loss or change, even in the context of God's plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Embrace the Holy Spirit as the Comforter who provides peace and guidance in times of sorrow.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Trust that God's plan, even when it involves difficult changes, is ultimately for our good and His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_beyond_sorrow.htm">Hope Beyond Sorrow</a></b><br>Focus on the hope and joy that come from Jesus' promises, which transcend present sorrows.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_support.htm">Community Support</a></b><br>Lean on fellow believers for support and encouragement during times of sorrow, as the disciples did.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_16_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 16:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_comfort_in_deep_sorrow.htm">How can we find comfort when "sorrow has filled your heart" (John 16:6)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/John_16_6_Trust_Jesus_in_hard_times.htm">What does John 16:6 teach about trusting Jesus during difficult times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_16_6_to_Holy_Spirit_promise.htm">How does John 16:6 connect to Jesus' promise of the Holy Spirit?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_John_16_6_in_trials_today.htm">How can we apply John 16:6 when facing personal trials today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_16_6_inspire_trust_in_God.htm">In what ways does John 16:6 encourage reliance on God's plan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_focus_on_sorrow_not_hope_in_John_16_6.htm">Why does John 16:6 emphasize sorrow over Jesus' departure instead of hope in His return?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_16_6_Divine_presence_vs_absence.htm">How does John 16:6 challenge the understanding of divine presence and absence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_were_disciples_sad_in_John_16_6.htm">What historical context explains the disciples' sorrow in John 16:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_sin_that_leads_to_death.htm">What is the sin that leads to death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_discord.htm">How can I align my heart to revere You?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_can_god_'regret'_in_genesis_6_6.htm">In Genesis 6:6, how could an all-knowing God 'regret' creating humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_to_live_in_truth_and_love_with_god.htm">How can we live in truth and love through God?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 16:6 Mean</div><b>Instead</b><p>Jesus has just said, &#8220;But now I am going to Him who sent Me&#8221;
