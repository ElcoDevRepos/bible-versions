The act of turning suggests a moment of reflection or curiosity on Peter's part. The phrase "the disciple whom Jesus loved" emphasizes the special bond between Jesus and John, which is a recurring theme in this Gospel (<a href="/john/13-23.htm">John 13:23, 19</a>:26, 20:2). This relationship is significant as it underscores the intimate fellowship that Jesus had with His closest followers. The setting is post-resurrection, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, a place of many significant events in Jesus' ministry, adding a layer of historical and geographical context to the narrative.<p><b>He was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper</b><br>This refers to the Last Supper, a pivotal event in the New Testament, where Jesus shared His final meal with His disciples before His crucifixion. The act of leaning back against Jesus signifies a position of closeness and trust, indicating John's intimate relationship with Jesus. This moment is recorded in <a href="/john/13-23.htm">John 13:23-25</a>, where John is depicted as being in a position to ask Jesus questions privately. The cultural context of reclining at meals in the ancient Near East is important here, as it was customary for diners to recline on couches, which facilitated such intimate interactions.<p><b>to ask, &#8220;Lord, who is going to betray You?&#8221;</b><br>This question refers to the moment during the Last Supper when Jesus revealed that one of His disciples would betray Him (<a href="/john/13-21.htm">John 13:21-26</a>). John's inquiry shows his concern and desire to understand Jesus' foretelling of His betrayal. This moment fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being betrayed by a close associate (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>). It also sets the stage for the unfolding of the Passion narrative, where Judas Iscariot's betrayal leads to Jesus' arrest and crucifixion. The question reflects the tension and uncertainty among the disciples during this critical moment in Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and leadership among the apostles.

He had been the companion and friend of St. Peter (comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 371). More than any other--and this is made prominent here--he had entered into close communion with the Lord Himself. He was called the "disciple whom Jesus loved" (comp. <a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>, and <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 375); he had leaned on His breast at supper, and, at a sign from Peter, had asked who was the traitor; he may well think that for him too there was some glimpse into the future, some declaration of what his path should be; or in that mingling of act and thought, of sign and thing signified, which run all through these verses, his following may indicate that he too, though he had never dared to say so, was ready to follow wherever the Master went.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The revelations made to patient waiting for the coming of the Lord, with correction of a misunderstanding touching the disciple whom Jesus loved. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having turned himself round,</span> instead of keeping every glance for his Lord, <span class="cmt_word">Peter seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), obeying the command without offering one suggestion. The writer adds, by way of further identification, <span class="cmt_word">he who also leaned back at the supper, upon his breast, and said, Who is he that betrayeth thee?</span> (see notes on John 13:23). The note is here introduced to show the close connection of Peter and the beloved disciple. It was Simon Peter who had beckoned at the supper to the beloved disciple to ask this very question. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Peter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Petros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4074.htm">Strong's 4074: </a> </span><span class="str2">Peter, a Greek name meaning rock.
