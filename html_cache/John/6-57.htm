The term "living Father" underscores God's eternal and life-giving nature, contrasting with the dead idols of surrounding cultures. The sending of Jesus is a central theme in the Gospel of John, reflecting the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). This mission is rooted in the divine plan for salvation, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God sends His Son out of love for the world.<p><b>and I live because of the Father</b><br>Here, Jesus acknowledges His dependence on the Father, emphasizing the unity and co-existence within the Trinity. This statement reflects the intimate relationship between Jesus and the Father, as seen in <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, "I and the Father are one." It also points to the source of Jesus' authority and power, which is derived from the Father, aligning with the concept of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>so also the one who feeds on Me</b><br>This phrase introduces the metaphor of feeding, which is central to the discourse on the Bread of Life in <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>. Feeding on Jesus symbolizes a deep, sustaining relationship with Him, akin to the spiritual nourishment provided by the manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16). This metaphor is further explained in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the Bread of Life, offering eternal sustenance to those who believe.<p><b>will live because of Me</b><br>The promise of life through Jesus is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John, emphasizing eternal life as a present and future reality for believers. This life is not merely physical but spiritual, rooted in a relationship with Christ.

Christ began by speaking of himself as the Bread of God, as the life-giving Bread, as the living Bread of human souls. He made it then clear that he was this by reason of his Divine humanity given for the life of the world. He added to this that he was specially to be appropriated and accepted as a sacrifice, as the death sacrifice, involved in his giving his flesh for the life of the world. The power conferred by his death in life and life in death for man, enabled him to institute eternal life-giving relations between himself and those who entirely accept and make their own this central reality. And now, to meet the nascent objection as to the unique grandeur of his position, he adds: <span class="cmt_word">As the living Father sent me.</span> The phrase, "living Father," occurs nowhere else (cf. "righteous Father," <a href="/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>; "holy Father," <a href="/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>; "the living God," <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>; and above all, ch. 5:26, "As the Father hath life in himself, so he gave also to the Son to have life in himself"). Christ is speaking of the human position he assumed before them as <span class="accented">sent</span> by the Father who has life in himself, who is more than all his laws or all his works. Not merely as the Word, but as the Word of the living Father made flesh, he stands before them. <span class="cmt_word">And I live because of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father.</span> "Because he lives, I live; my life is guaranteed by his." This is the premiss, the platform on which he now stands (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> must not be confounded with <span class="accented">per Patrem</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as M"Leod Campbell, who, in his interesting discussion on "Christ the Bread of Life," made this expression equivalent to the means and condition of the Saviour's life). From this premiss the Lord argues a corresponding relation of the believer to himself: <span class="cmt_word">So he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me.</span> The points of comparison are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Father's life-imparting relation to Christ, and Christ's life-imparting relation to the believer. In both cases the life of one is the guarantee of the life of the other. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sending of Christ by the Father, correlated with the eating of Christ by the believer. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The peculiar relation of the believer to Christ. "He that eateth me" gathers up and really comprehends all that has gone before. It is, then, possible for the believer not only to share in the Divine humanity by his faith, and also in the fulness and significance of iris (blood) death, but to have full possession of his Divine <span class="accented">personality</span>. "He that eateth me shall live because of me" (cf. "Because I live, ye shall live also," <a href="/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>). This is the vindication of the previous verse, and the climax of the argument. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-57.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Just as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
