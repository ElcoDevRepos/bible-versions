The first sign was the turning of water into wine at Cana (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>). Signs in John's Gospel are meant to inspire belief in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>). This second sign further establishes Jesus' power and authority, reinforcing His divine mission.<p><b>that Jesus performed</b><br>Jesus' miracles are not merely acts of compassion but are deliberate demonstrations of His divine nature and authority. They serve as evidence of His messianic identity and His connection to God the Father. The performance of signs is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies that the Messiah would perform wonders (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><b>after coming from Judea into Galilee</b><br>This geographical movement is significant. Judea, particularly Jerusalem, was the religious center of Jewish life, while Galilee was more rural and less esteemed. Jesus' return to Galilee, where He performed His first miracle, highlights His ministry's reach beyond the religious elite to the common people. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee. This movement from Judea to Galilee underscores the universal scope of Jesus' mission, reaching all people regardless of their social or religious standing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, performing miracles to reveal His divine nature and mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea.htm">Judea</a></b><br>A region in ancient Israel where Jesus began His public ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>The region to which Jesus returned and where He performed this second sign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_official's_son.htm">The Royal Official's Son</a></b><br>The recipient of Jesus' miraculous healing, which is the context of this second sign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cana.htm">Cana</a></b><br>The town in Galilee where Jesus performed His first miracle of turning water into wine and now performs this second sign.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The royal official believed Jesus' word and acted on it by returning home, demonstrating that true faith often requires action before evidence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_authority.htm">Jesus' Authority</a></b><br>This sign reinforces Jesus' authority over physical ailments and distance, reminding us of His sovereignty in all aspects of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_signs.htm">The Importance of Signs</a></b><br>Signs in the Gospel of John are meant to reveal Jesus' divine nature and lead people to faith, not just to amaze or entertain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/growth_in_faith.htm">Growth in Faith</a></b><br>The royal official's faith grew from seeking a miracle to trusting in Jesus' word, illustrating the journey of faith many believers experience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_to_others.htm">Witnessing to Others</a></b><br>The healing of the official's son led to his entire household believing, showing the ripple effect of personal testimony and faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_4_54_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 4:54?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_4_54_Jesus_power_over_illness.htm">How does John 4:54 demonstrate Jesus' authority over sickness and healing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_faith_from_John_4_54.htm">What can we learn about faith from the official's response in John 4:54?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_4_54_to_OT_healings.htm">How does this miracle in John 4:54 connect to Old Testament healings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Jesus_teachings_today.htm">How can we apply the lesson of belief in Jesus' word today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_4_54_Trust_Jesus_timing.htm">What does John 4:54 teach us about trusting Jesus' timing in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_John_4_54_in_miracles.htm">What significance does John 4:54 hold in the context of Jesus' miracles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_4_54_Jesus_divine_authority.htm">How does John 4:54 demonstrate Jesus' divine authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_John_4_54_key_to_Jesus_work.htm">Why is the second miracle in John 4:54 important for understanding Jesus' ministry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_no_extra-biblical_record_of_matt_14.htm">Why is there no known extra-biblical historical record of these miracles in Matthew 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_is_cana's_miracle_only_in_john.htm">Why does this miracle at Cana (John 2:1-11) only appear in John's Gospel and not in the Synoptics?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/where_did_jesus_meet_peter_and_andrew.htm">Where did Jesus first meet Simon Peter and Andrew?

This affirms His creative power mirrored in <a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks and it is so.<p>&#8226; Other passages confirm that Jesus&#8217; miracles are never random acts of kindness but purposeful revelations (<a href="/mark/2-10.htm">Mark 2:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after coming from Judea</b><p>&#8226; Jesus had just left Judea, where He faced growing opposition (<a href="/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1-3</a>) and where His prior ministry, including cleansing the temple (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-22</a>), confronted legalistic unbelief.<p>&#8226; The move from Judea to Galilee highlights a transition from a skeptical environment to one where faith would blossom&#8212;even among Gentile-leaning regions (cf. <a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24-27</a>).<p>&#8226; It models how God often redirects servants when hearts harden, just as Paul later turned from resistant Jews to receptive Gentiles (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into Galilee</b><p>&#8226; Galilee was considered spiritually provincial (<a href="/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>), yet it becomes a stage for repeated revelation (<a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The royal official, likely serving Herod Antipas, represents influential circles that begin to recognize Jesus&#8217; authority (<a href="/john/4-53.htm">John 4:53</a>).<p>&#8226; By choosing Galilee, Jesus shows that salvation is not confined to religious centers; grace reaches humble and marginalized places (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/4-54.htm">John 4:54</a> records the second divinely orchestrated &#8220;sign&#8221; in Jesus&#8217; Galilean ministry. By sequencing and spotlighting these miracles, Scripture affirms that each work was intentional, evidencing Christ&#8217;s power and Messiahship. Coming from an increasingly hostile Judea into receptive Galilee, Jesus demonstrates that His authoritative word heals, saves, and invites faith wherever hearts are open.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(54) <span class= "bld">This is again the second.</span>--The English version has inserted the article, which is not found in the Greek, and has added in italics <span class= "ital">is</span> and <span class= "ital">that.</span> Omitting these additions, and remembering that in St. John's language every miracle has its deeper teaching, the verse will read, "This again, a second sign, did Jesus when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee." His first presence in Galilee was marked by a sign (<a href="/context/john/2-1.htm" title="And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:">John 2:1-11</a>), and this visit is also. There the individual disciples, who were to leave home and follow him, read the lesson the sign was meant to teach. Now for the first time the family is the unit in the Christian life, and the father, himself taught to read the sign, becomes the first teacher, and representative, of the first Christian household.<p>This miracle of healing naturally brings to the thoughts the healing of the centurion's servant. See Notes on <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm" title="And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,">Matthew 8:5</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> and <a href="/luke/7-2.htm" title="And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.">Luke 7:2</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> To some minds, from Irenaeus downwards, the resemblance has seemed so striking that nothing short of identification could explain it. But there is no <span class= "ital">a priori</span> reason why two miracles should not be performed under circumstances in some respects analogous, and the knowledge of the healing in this case may well have led to the faith in that. If we bear in mind that the miracle is ever to be regarded as the parable in act, it is probable that the acts of Christ would be repeated. Repetition is a part of the method of every great teacher, and formed a large part in the Rabbinic systems Jesus Christ was, it is true, infinitely above .all human teachers, but His hearers were ordinary men, and His teaching and working must have adapted itself to the constitution of the human mind. A comparison of the present narratives will establish the following points of difference, which in their totality amount, it is believed, to little short of proof, that St. John has added the history of a sign which is not recorded in the earlier Gospels.<p>(1) It is here a nobleman who pleads for his son; there a centurion for his servant (<a href="/matthew/8-6.htm" title="And saying, Lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.">Matthew 8:6</a>; <a href="/luke/7-2.htm" title="And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.">Luke 7:2</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is again a second sign which Jesus did, when he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.</span> The point is that each return from Judaea to Galilee had been charged with special emphasis by the occurrence of a "sign." We are told (<a href="/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23</a>; <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>) of slams wrought in Jerusalem, and, consequently, it could not be meant to be the second sign wrought by him. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> clause, <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the repetition of his entrance on work in Galilee. The first sign was the transformation of the water; the second, under similar conditions, was the healing a dying child by his word (so Godet, Lunge, and Westcott). This passage of St. John's Gospel which we have now reviewed is a distinct period of our Lord's life and ministry, concerning which the synoptists were silent; and it is marvellously complete in itself. It is an epitome of the whole life of the blessed Lord, and presents an outline and specimen of his method and his work. The disciple unnamed seems always at the side of the Lord. A mighty spell had fallen on him; and he was beginning already to discern in him the characteristics which ultimately directed him to compose the prologue. The penetration of the hidden secrets of all hearts - first his own, then those of Cephas and Nathanael, and the motives of Mary, and the spirit of Nicodemus, the intentions of the Pharisees, the secret life of the Samaritaness, and the inchoate and imperfect faith of the nobleman. Jesus is presented to us in marvellously different, yet mutually complementary, relations. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Gathering susceptible spirits to himself, and judging men by the reception they were giving or not giving to his word; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Nathanael, Nicodemus, the Jews, the Samaritans, the Galilaeans. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Accepting or revealing the mightiest and most enduring names - "The Son of God," "the Lamb of God," the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, "the King of Israel," the Opener of the kingdom of heaven, the Creator of all things, the Head of the theocracy, the Rebuilder of the temple of his body, the Teacher of the teacher of Israel, the "Son of man," the Saviour, the Giver of eternal life, the Light, the Bridegroom of the true bride, the Object of the eternal Father's love, the Revealer of the Father in his most essential features and most perfect will, the "Prophet that should come into the world," the "Saviour of the world," the "Christ of God." <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> We see him, in the majesty of his omnipotence, hiding himself, as the Almighty always does, behind and in his works; we see him hallowing and heightening the joys of nuptial love, and again purifying the house of God from all contaminating adjuncts; we see him in his exalted mood consumed by holy zeal, and also weary and thirsty by the well, asking for water from an alien, and making to her the most astonishing revelations, hushing the pride, as they have secured the reverence, of all after ages by their spirituality and refinement.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-54.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This [was]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(Touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] second</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(deuteron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1208.htm">Strong's 1208: </a> </span><span class="str2">Second; with the article: in the second place, for the second time.
