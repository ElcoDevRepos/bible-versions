In the context of <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a>, Jesus spoke about the world's hatred towards His followers and the coming persecution. This is consistent with His role as a prophet, preparing His disciples for future challenges. The phrase underscores the importance of Jesus' words as a source of guidance and strength. It also reflects the prophetic tradition in the Old Testament, where prophets often warned the people of Israel about future events to prepare them spiritually and morally.<p><b>so that you will not fall away.</b><br>The concern here is apostasy, a falling away from faith, which was a significant issue in the early church. Jesus' warning is meant to fortify the disciples against the trials they will face, ensuring they remain steadfast. This reflects the broader biblical theme of perseverance in faith, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23-25</a>, which encourages believers to hold unswervingly to the hope they profess. The cultural context of the time included severe persecution from both Jewish authorities and the Roman Empire, making the risk of falling away a real and present danger. Jesus' words serve as a reminder of the importance of remaining rooted in His teachings, drawing strength from His promises and the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, Jesus is preparing His disciples for the challenges they will face after His departure.
