The "other sheep" are often understood to represent the Gentiles, highlighting the inclusivity of the Gospel. This aligns with Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the nations. The concept of "fold" suggests a specific group or community, initially the Jewish nation, but Jesus' mission is universal.<p><b>I must bring them in as well,</b><br>The necessity ("must") underscores the divine mandate and purpose of Jesus' mission. This reflects God's sovereign plan for salvation, as seen in passages like <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where the disciples are instructed to be witnesses to the ends of the earth. The phrase suggests active pursuit and intentionality in reaching the Gentiles, fulfilling the Abrahamic promise that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and they will listen to My voice.</b><br>This indicates the response of the "other sheep" to Jesus' call, emphasizing the recognition and acceptance of His authority. It echoes <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3-4</a>, where the sheep recognize the shepherd's voice. This listening is not merely auditory but involves obedience and discipleship, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith comes by hearing the word of Christ.<p><b>Then there will be one flock and one shepherd.</b><br>This phrase points to the unity of believers under Christ, transcending ethnic and cultural boundaries. It fulfills <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>, where God promises one shepherd for His people. The imagery of one flock under one shepherd signifies the church's unity, as further elaborated in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, where Christ breaks down the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile, creating one new humanity. This unity is both a present reality and a future hope, culminating in the eschatological vision of <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation worships together.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is the Good Shepherd who is discussing His mission and the unity of His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolic of believers or followers of Christ.

They will hear his voice. We in vain ask the question, "When?" He alone can answer it. Many a Cornelius in every nation is accepted by him (cf. <a href="/acts/10-35.htm">Acts 10:35</a>; <a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>; <a href="/acts/17-27.htm">Acts 17:27</a>; <a href="/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>). But the passage contemplates a wider application: "Them also I must bring, or lead, among my own." They are scattered abroad now, but eternal Love, by assuming Shepherd-wise relations with them, determines not to bring them to one place or enclosure - to express such a thought we should have had, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>) or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (Westcott) - but to bring them into personal relations with himself. <span class="cmt_word">They shall become one flock, one Shepherd</span>. The false English translation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, viz. "fold," should be specially noticed. If our Lord had meant to convey the idea of the rigid enclosure into which all the scattered sheep should be gathered, he would have used the word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> is, however, studiously chosen. The error has done grievous injury. There is no variation of the Greek text, or in the earliest versions. It came through the Vulgate <span class="accented">ovile</span> into Wickliffe's Version, and into many other European versions. The Old Latin Versions were correct, but Jerome led the way into the inaccurate translation. Tyndale perceived its true meaning, and Luther beautifully preserved the play upon the words. Coverdale, in his own Bible (1535), followed Tyndale; but in 1539, "the Great Bible" followed the Vulgate (Westcott). When naturalized, it sustained the false and growing pretension that outside the one "fold" of the visible Church the good Shepherd was not ready with his care and <span class="accented">love</span> (see for the only adequate translation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, <a href="/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31</a>; <a href="/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where the Authorized Version has correctly rendered it "flock"). Christ, on other occasions, carefully warned his disciples against such narrowness, and here he declares that the sheep, independently of the fold or folds, may yet form one great <span class="accented">flock</span>, under <span class="accented">one Shepherd</span>. When he described himself as the <span class="accented">Door</span>, he was, as we have seen, careful to speak of himself as "Door of the <span class="accented">sheep</span>," and not as the Door into the <span class="accented">fold</span>. He laid down his life in order to break down the partition between Jew and Gentile (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>), between God and man, and between man and man. "In Christ Jesus there is neither Jew nor Greek, male nor female, bond nor free." There may be many folds. Different nations, ages, times, and seasons may cause variations in these; but there is but one flock under the watchful guardianship of one Shepherd. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(ech&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
