His ministry was to prepare the way for Jesus, emphasizing the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.<p><b>&#8216;A man who comes after me</b><br>John acknowledges that Jesus began His public ministry after John&#8217;s own.

John the Baptist publicly identifies Jesus as the very One his earlier preaching anticipated (<a href="/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15, 26</a>&#8211;27).<p>&#8226; By pointing to Jesus, John fulfills the role promised in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, showing how prophecy and history meet with perfect accuracy.<p>&#8226; The phrase spotlights John&#8217;s unwavering commitment to direct all attention away from himself and toward the Messiah (<a href="/john/3-28.htm">John 3:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A man who comes after me</b><p>&#8226; Jesus stepped onto the public scene after John had already begun baptizing (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1&#8211;3, 21</a>&#8211;22), yet He is called &#8220;a man&#8221; to affirm His full humanity (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s wording underscores his forerunner mission; he prepares the way and then gladly moves aside as the One greater than he arrives (<a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminds us that God&#8217;s timetable is precise: first the herald, then the King.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has surpassed me</b><p>&#8226; Though multitudes flocked to John, he freely admits Jesus outranks him in status and authority (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s humility anticipates his later confession, &#8220;He must increase, but I must decrease&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus surpasses John because He is the Lamb of God who removes sin (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>) and the Son of God (<a href="/john/1-34.htm">John 1:34</a>), roles no prophet could ever claim.<p>&#8226;

This statement aligns with <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which speaks of the Messiah whose &#8220;origins are from of old, from ancient times,&#8221; and with Jesus&#8217; own words, &#8220;Before Abraham was born, I am!&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>).<p>&#8226; By rooting Christ&#8217;s superiority in His eternity, John testifies to the full deity of Jesus, who &#8220;is before all things, and in Him all things hold together&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/1-30.htm">John 1:30</a> captures four linked truths: John identifies Jesus as the promised One, acknowledges His later earthly arrival, proclaims His surpassing greatness, and grounds that greatness in His eternal preexistence.

If the shorter reading of vers. 26, 27 be correct, then the occasion on which this great utterance was first made is not described. If it be not expunged from vers. 26, 27, we may imagine that John is now referring to what he said on the previous day to the Sanhedrim. If internal reasons may help to decide a reading, I should be inclined, with Godet as against Meyer, to say that this is the obvious reference. Here, too, the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span> is added as explanation of what was enigmatical in ver. 26. The whole saying has already found place in the prologue. The threefold citation reveals the profound impression which the words of the Baptist had made upon his most susceptible disciple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
