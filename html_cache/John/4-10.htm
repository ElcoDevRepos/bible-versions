His response is significant as it breaks cultural norms; Jews typically avoided Samaritans due to longstanding enmity. Jesus' willingness to engage with her highlights His mission to reach all people, transcending ethnic and social barriers. This interaction foreshadows the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>If you knew the gift of God</b><br>The "gift of God" refers to the salvation and eternal life offered through Jesus Christ. This phrase emphasizes the grace and generosity of God, who offers salvation freely to those who believe. It echoes <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which speaks of salvation as a gift from God, not a result of works. The concept of God's gift is central to the Gospel message, underscoring the unmerited favor bestowed upon humanity.<p><b>and who is asking you for a drink</b><br>Here, Jesus alludes to His identity as the Messiah. The woman is unaware of who Jesus truly is, which is a common theme in the Gospels where people often fail to recognize Jesus' divine nature. This phrase invites reflection on the importance of recognizing Jesus' true identity, as seen in Peter's confession in <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>. The request for a drink also symbolizes Jesus' humility and His willingness to meet people in their everyday circumstances.<p><b>you would have asked Him</b><br>This phrase suggests that recognizing Jesus' identity and the gift He offers should lead to a response of faith and a desire for what He provides. It implies that the woman, and by extension all people, should seek Jesus for spiritual fulfillment. This aligns with <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>, where Jesus encourages asking, seeking, and knocking as a way to receive from God.<p><b>and He would have given you living water</b><br>"Living water" is a metaphor for the Holy Spirit and the eternal life that Jesus offers. In the cultural context, living water referred to fresh, flowing water, as opposed to stagnant water. Spiritually, it signifies the life-giving and renewing power of the Holy Spirit, as further explained in <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>. This concept is rooted in Old Testament imagery, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, where God is described as the "fountain of living waters." Jesus, as the source of living water, fulfills the prophetic imagery of providing spiritual sustenance and eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is engaging in a conversation with a Samaritan woman at a well.

Yet there can be little doubt of the true meaning if we observe the turn given to her question by the emphatic pronouns, "<span class= "ital">Thou</span> wouldest have asked of <span class= "ital">Him."</span> You stand by this deep well that for centuries has been God's gift of refreshment to man and beast; you have the means of drawing the water, and are thus the apparent benefactor to Him who asks for your aid. It is not really so. There is a deep well of spiritual truth in communion with God, as necessary for man's true life as water is for the natural life. I stand here with the means to draw, with the power to enter the depths hidden from man, and reveal to your spirit the Being of God. It is really you that are the traveller in the journey of life, weary with the burning heat of its trials, and travel-stained by the sins through which you have passed, thirsting in the hopes and fears of that spirit that cannot rest apart from God, helpless at the very side of the well, for the Eternal is ever near you, and you know Him not.

Elsewhere (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>) Christ is himself God's Gift, and St. Paul speaks of Christ as God's unspeakable Gift (Hengstenberg). Paul also declares that "the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ." The living water, the refreshing, life-giving stream of blessedness which Christ is opening in this wilderness, is the meaning put back by some into these memorable words as they first fell from the lips of Jesus. So Lampe and Godet. But Augustine and others point to <a href="/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>, where John tells us that the living water of which Jesus speaks as welling up like a river in the heart of a believer, in the bosom of one who has come to him to slake his otherwise quenchless thirst, is "the Spirit," which those who believe on him should receive when Jesus would be glorified. This sublime renewal of the greatest gift of God by the Spirit is set forth under similar imagery in <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a> and <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>. However, words are functions of two minds; what they must or might have meant to her must have been Christ's meaning when he uttered them. The explanatory clause, <span class="accented">Who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink</span>, solves the perplexity. That the Son of God, that the Logos in flesh, should have so emptied himself of his eternal glory as to ask for water from a Samaritan, and a woman, is in itself a gift, the supreme gift, of God. She did not know the fulness of his nature. So Lange, Grotius, and others. A remark by Dr. Yeomans is singularly suggestive: "The context shows that 'the gift of God' is a gift which God had already given, rather than one yet held in reserve - the <span class="accented">actual gift</span> of his condescension, rather than the offered gift of living water, or the Holy Ghost." Had she known it and put the two thoughts together in the rudest fashion, she would have known the gift of God, and she would have become the suppliant at once and he the Giver. <span class="cmt_word">Thou wouldest have asked</span> (prayed, taken the position of the inferior) <span class="cmt_word">of him, and he would have given to thee living water</span>. (For the phrase, "living water," see <a href="/genesis/26-19.htm">Genesis 26:19</a>; and for its application, <a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>.) The Divine supply of heaven-sent life, which will slake all thirst for lesser gifts, and which will constitute the perennial blessedness of saved and glorified spirits. The gift of God is the full discovery of personal relations with the veritable Source of all life. This becomes life eternal as it leads to knowledge of the only God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent; and assists a full realization of the life, the Source and End of which are God. It is interesting to notice that Philo, in many places, declares these wells of water (<a href="/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2</a>) to mean "true philosophy or wisdom, deep and only with difficulty drawn upon." "Flowing water is the Logos himself, 'cisterns' represent memories of past knowledge;" but the Old Testament usage quoted above is a far more rational justification of the language used by our Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
