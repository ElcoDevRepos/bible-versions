This statement foreshadows His departure from the earthly realm and return to the Father.

It reflects a spiritual searching that will be in vain due to their unbelief and rejection of Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>but you will die in your sin</b><br>A solemn warning of the consequences of unbelief. The singular "sin" may refer to the specific sin of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah. This phrase underscores the gravity of their spiritual condition and the eternal consequences of their disbelief.<p><b>Where I am going, you cannot come</b><br>Jesus speaks of His return to the Father, a place of divine presence and glory.

He is still free to address the multitude, and after an interval does so. This interval is marked by the word "again," but is not necessarily more than a short break in the discourse. We shall find reason for believing (see Note on <a href="/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>) that the whole of the teaching and work which is included between <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>; <a href="/john/10-21.htm" title="Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?">John 10:21</a>, is probably to be placed on the last and great day of the feast. The persons addressed are the people assembled round Him in the Temple. Some of the officials take part in the discussion, for it is "the Jews" who reply in the next verse. We have to think, it may be, of men gathered together in small groups discussing what He had before said. Some are really inquiring with earnest hearts about Him. The rulers are trying to suppress the growing conviction of the multitude. There are thus two currents of thought and feeling. One is found in the honest hearts of the untutored multitude; they know little of argument, and dare not interpret the Scriptures for themselves, but in their rough-and-ready way they are grasping the truth; the heart of man is bowing before the presence of its God. The other is found in the priests and rulers to whom, as a holy and learned caste, the representatives of God to man and the interpreters of their Sacred Books, the people are in intellectual and moral bondage. They seek to bind with their fetters hearts that are finding their way to the truth. Some of these groups have moved on, it may be, and others have taken their place. Seeing a new audience near Him, Jesus speaks to them again; for it is not probable that the words of <a href="/john/8-27.htm" title="They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.">John 8:27</a> apply wholly to the same persons as those in <a href="/john/8-19.htm" title="Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - This verse introduces a new scene and place, and perhaps a new day. The audience may have greatly changed, even if it had within it some of the same bewildered and exasperated enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Again</span> <span class="cmt_word">he said, therefore.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the fact that his liberty had not been infringed. The providence of God, the fear of the people, the inadequacy or confusing nature of the reports of his speech which had been taken to the authorities, had for a while arrested the tragedy. "No one laid hands on him." In consequence of this circumstance he said <span class="cmt_word">unto them again</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> on a subsequent occasion), <span class="cmt_word">I go away, and ye shall seek me.</span> So much he had said before to "the Jews," adding, "Ye shall not find me" (<a href="/john/7-34.htm">John 7:34</a>). Thus also he spake, later on, to the disciples, adding, "Thither ye cannot come" (<a href="/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>). On all three occasions he was misunderstood. His departure was a mystery to the Jews, who thought, or at least said, that he, a pseudo-Messiah, might be contemplating a mission to the Greeks and to the Dispersion. His departure to the Father by a bloodstained pathway, by violent death, was unspeakably perplexing to his most intimate friends. The bare idea utterly conflicted with the current notion of the Christ; but it was in the last case (ch. 14.) modified by the promise that, though he was about to leave them and to return to his Father, yet he would come again - they should once more beheld him, and he would provide a place for them. Still, they would not be able for a while to follow him, even though willing to lay down their life for his sake (<a href="/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>, etc.). But in the face of a more bitter misunderstanding and an utter inability to perceive and know either him or the Father, Christ said not only, "Ye shall seek me," <span class="cmt_word">but ye shall die in your sin</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> here indicates rather the condition in which they should die than the cause of their death. "In," not "of" (so Hengstenberg, Meyer, and Luthardt). He did not say, "perish by reason <span class="accented">of</span> this sin," but "die <span class="accented">in</span> this sin." They will die looking vaguely, hopelessly, for the Saviour whom they have, in such an hyperbole of spiritual dulness and of bitter malice alike, misunderstood and rejected. They will pass through the gate of death with no deliverance from sin secured. Knowing neither the Father nor the eternal life and light manifested in himself, they will seek and not find, they will die unsanctified, unatoned, unreconciled No gleam of light will play over the dark ness of the grave. <span class="cmt_word">Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span> The eternal home of the Father's love will not open to such angry search. Such utter misunderstanding as they had evinced, such point blank refusal to walk in his light, will impede and block the way to the heart of the Father, whose perfect revelation and sufficient pleading they steadily resist. The language of this verse is probably the condensation and conclusion of s much longer debate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Again</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(palin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3825.htm">Strong's 3825: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from the same as pale; anew, i.e. back, once more, or furthermore or on the other hand.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
