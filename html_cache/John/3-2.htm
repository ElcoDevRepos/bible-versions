This timing may indicate a desire for privacy, possibly due to fear of being seen by other Jewish leaders. Nighttime meetings were not uncommon in ancient times for those seeking uninterrupted conversation. Theologically, the motif of night can symbolize spiritual darkness, contrasting with Jesus as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Rabbi,</b><br>Nicodemus addresses Jesus as "Rabbi," a term of respect meaning "teacher." Despite his own status as a learned Pharisee, Nicodemus acknowledges Jesus' authority and wisdom. This reflects a recognition of Jesus' unique role and the respect He commanded even among some Jewish leaders.<p><b>we know that You are a teacher who has come from God.</b><br>Nicodemus speaks on behalf of others, suggesting that there is a collective acknowledgment among some Jewish leaders of Jesus' divine mission. This statement implies an awareness of Jesus' divine authority and aligns with the Old Testament prophecies of a coming teacher or prophet like Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>).<p><b>For no one could perform the signs You are doing</b><br>The "signs" refer to the miracles Jesus performed, which were seen as evidence of divine power. In the Gospel of John, signs are significant as they reveal Jesus' identity and mission. These acts fulfill Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah performing miraculous deeds (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><b>if God were not with him.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the divine presence and approval in Jesus' ministry. It echoes the concept of God being with His chosen servants, as seen with figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>).

His midnight visit paints every sinner&#8217;s first step from darkness toward light.<p>&#8226; Nicodemus later appears more openly&#8212;defending Jesus before the council (<a href="/john/7-50.htm">John 7:50-52</a>) and aiding in His burial (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39-42</a>)&#8212;evidence that honest inquiry can blossom into courageous faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said, &#8220;Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God.</b><p>&#8226; Addressing Jesus as &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; shows respect for His authority despite His lack of formal rabbinic schooling (<a href="/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2-3</a>; <a href="/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;We know&#8221; hints that other religious leaders have reached similar conclusions but keep silent (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-48</a>). Truth resonates even when it is suppressed.<p>&#8226; Declaring Jesus &#8220;a teacher who has come from God&#8221; echoes the promised prophet like Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>) and agrees with Jesus&#8217; own testimony, &#8220;My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Acknowledgment of divine origin, however, is only the starting line; saving faith must progress from intellectual assent to wholehearted trust (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Nicodemus bases his conclusion on the visible miracles already performed (<a href="/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, signs authenticate God&#8217;s messengers&#8212;Moses before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/4-1.htm">Exodus 4:1-5</a>), Elijah on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>). Jesus perfectly fits that biblical pattern.<p>&#8226; Peter will later proclaim the same logic: &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth was a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; While miracles capture attention, Jesus quickly shifts the conversation to the new birth (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-8</a>).

But the Sanhedrin had officially taken a hostile position, and an individual member of it dare not openly take any other.

Thoma, here intent on his principle of the fabricated character of the Gospel, compares this to King Saul (Paul's ancestor!) going by night to Samuel - a type of Christ! There is more probability that the night of the Last Supper was in the mind of John, and that these two nights, the one at the beginning, the other at the close of the ministry of Jesus - nights of extraordinary significance - were impressed ineffaceably on his memory, and, to some extent, contrasted with each other. Nicodemus did not fear the Lord or his disciples, but his own colleagues, whose excitement had already betrayed their sentiments. Without "believing on his Name," they had come to some conclusions, and Nicodemus with them. <span class="cmt_word">Rabbi</span>, said he, <span class="cmt_word">we know.</span> He does not conceal a common sentiment at that moment agitating his own class in society, and he bestows the honorific title of Rabbi, "my Master," which, as coming from a learned doctor to a humble peasant, was a remarkable testimony to the effect Jesus had indirectly exerted beyond the circle of his immediate hearers: that thou art a Teacher come from God. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, precedes "the Teacher come." Certainly it yields to Jesus great dignity. He is God-sent, like the prophets of old. He has a right to teach. His doctorate is a heavenly diploma; and Nicodemus draws a wiser conclusion than the many did who, in some sense, believed on his Name. They were rushing heedlessly forward to further conclusions. Nicodemus saw a grand authority as a Teacher of men, a Heaven-sent Messenger, in the Lord Jesus, and he came to this conclusion from the settled persuasion that no man can do the signs which thou art performing, if God be not with him. This confession was true, indicating candid and honest inquiry and a teachable mind. It was the very truth which Peter in subsequent times gave to Cornelius as explanation of the healing and beneficent powers of Jesus. Christ knew the whole man, understood at once the honesty of the inquiry, and did entrust himself to Nicodemus.
