The term "receive" implies an active acceptance and welcoming of Jesus into one's life. In the context of the Gospel of John, receiving Jesus is more than a mere acknowledgment; it involves a personal relationship and commitment. This echoes the invitation in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Jesus stands at the door and knocks, waiting for individuals to open their hearts to Him. The concept of receiving Christ is also seen in the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>), where the good soil represents those who hear the word and understand it, leading to a fruitful life.<p><b>to those who believed in His name</b><br>Belief in His name signifies trust and faith in the identity and mission of Jesus. In Jewish culture, a name represents the essence and character of a person. Believing in Jesus' name means acknowledging Him as the Messiah, the Son of God, and the Savior of the world. This belief is not merely intellectual assent but involves a deep-seated trust and reliance on Jesus for salvation. The importance of belief is a recurring theme in John's Gospel, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, which highlights the necessity of faith for eternal life. The name of Jesus is powerful and central to Christian faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>, where salvation is found in no one else.<p><b>He gave the right to become children of God&#8212;</b><br>This phrase highlights the transformative power of faith in Christ. The "right" or "authority" to become children of God is a legal and relational term, indicating a change in status from being outside God's family to being fully adopted as His children. This adoption is a key theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a> and <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-7</a>, where believers are described as heirs with Christ. The concept of becoming children of God also fulfills Old Testament prophecies and promises, such as <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>, where it is foretold that those who were not God's people will be called "sons of the living God." This new identity as God's children is not based on human effort or lineage but solely on God's grace and the believer's faith in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel of John, referred to as "Him" in this verse.

The nation as such rejected Him; individuals in it accepted Him; but not individuals of that nation only. All who according to their light and means accept Him, receive from Him an authority and in Him a moral power, which constitutes them members of the true none to which He came, and the true children of God. They receive in acceptance the right which others lost in rejection. (Comp. Romans 9-11) The word rendered "received" is not quite the same as the word so rendered in <a href="/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11</a>. The latter is the welcome which may be expected as due from His own home. This is the reception given without a claim.<p><span class= "bld">To them that believe on his name</span> repeats the width of the condition, and at the same time explains what receiving Him means. It seems natural to understand the "name" of the only name which meets us in this context, that is, of the <span class= "ital">Logos</span> or Word, the representation of the will, character, nature of God. (See on <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>.) To "believe on" is one of St. John's characteristic words of fuller meaning. To believe is to accept as true; "devils believe and tremble" (<a href="/james/2-19.htm" title="You believe that there is one God; you do well: the devils also believe, and tremble.">James 2:19</a>). To believe in is to trust in, confide in. To believe on, has the idea of motion to and rest upon: it is here the going forth of the soul upon, and its rest upon, the firm basis of the eternal love of the eternal Spirit revealed in the Word. (Comp. Pearson <span class= "ital">On the Creed,</span> Art. 1, p. 16.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - But before the apostle advances to the central statement of the entire proem, he stops to show that, though the whole world, though man as an organized mass, though Israel as a favoured and selected theocracy, have refused to know and confess his supreme claims, yet there has always been an election of grace. All have not perished in their unbelief. Some have received him. The twelfth and thirteenth verses do, indeed, in their full meaning, refer unmistakably to the entire ministry of the living Christ to the end of time; but surely every word of it applies <span class="accented">primarily</span> (though not exclusively) to the whole previous pleadings of the Light and Life - to the ministry of the pre-existing and eternal Logos, and to the privileges and possibilities consequent thereupon. <span class="cmt_word">As many as received him</span>. This phrase is subsequently explained as being identical with "believed in his Name." The simple verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is less definite than are its compounds with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, used in the previous verses (5, 11). The acceptance is a positive idea, is broader, more manifold, less restricted as to manner of operation, than the negative rejection which took sharp and decisive form. The construction is irregular. We have a <span class="accented">nominativus pendens</span> followed by a clause in the dative; as much as if he had written, "There are, notwithstanding all the rejections, those who received him." To these, the evangelist says, however many or few they may be, <span class="cmt_word">who believe in his Name,</span> he - the subject of the previous sentence - <span class="cmt_word">gave the authority and capability of becoming children of God</span>. Believing in his Name is discriminated from believing him. The construction occurs thirty-five times in the Gospel, and three times in the First Epistle - and the Name here especially present to the writer is the Logos, the full revelation of the essence, character, and activity, of God. John, writing in the close of his life, surveys a glorious company of individuals who, by realizing as true the sum of all the perfections of the manifested Word, by believing in his Name, have also received as a gift the sense of such union to the Son of God that they become alive to the fact that they too are the offspring of God. This realization of the Divine fatherhood, which had been so obscure before, is itself the origination within them of filial feeling. Thus a new life is begotten and supervenes upon the old life. This new life is a new humanity within the bosom or womb of the old, and so it corresponds with the Pauline doctrine of new creation and of resurrection. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is more than opportunity, and less than (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) power; it is rightful claim (which is itself the gift of God) to become what they were not before, seeing that a Divine generation has begotten them again. They are born from above. The Spirit of the Son has passed into them, and they cry, "Abba, Father." This Divine begetting is still further explained and differentiated from ordinary human life. The writer distinctly repudiates the idea that the condition he speaks of is a consequence of simple birth into this world. This is done in a very emphatic manner (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;</span> here in the masculine, is the well known <span class="accented">constructio ad sensum</span>, and refers to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Who were begotten from God, not from</span> (or, <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>blood</span>. (The plural word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> has been variously rendered by expositors: Augustine regarding it as a reference to the blending of the blood of both sexes in ordinary generation; Meyer, as not different from the singular in meaning, giving numerous passages in the classics where this or an equivalent usage of the plural for the singular occurs. The suggestion of Moulton is more satisfactory - that it points to pride of race, common enough in Israel, but not peculiar to Jews.) John repudiates for this "generation" any connection with mere hereditary privilege. No twice-born Brahmin, no dignified race, no descendant of Abraham, can claim it as such, and the writer further discriminates it, as though he would leave no loophole for escape: <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet from the will of the flesh, nor even from the will of the man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). Some, very erroneously, have supposed that "the flesh" here refers to "woman" in contradistinction to "man," and numerous efforts have been made to point out the threefold distinction. The simplest and most obvious interpretation is that "the will of the flesh" here means the human process of generation on its lower side, and "the will of the man" the higher purposes of the nobler side of human nature, which lead to the same end. Special dignity is conferred by being the son of a special father; but however honoured such might be, as in the case of an Abraham, a David, a Zacharias, such paternity has nothing to do with the sonship of which the evangelist is thinking. Doubtless this triumphant new beginning of humanity can only be found in the full revelation of the name of the incarnate Logos; but surely the primary application of the passage is to the fact that, notwithstanding the stiff-necked rejection of the Logos by the peculiar possession and people of his love, there were, from Abraham to Malachi and to John the Baptist, those who did recognize the Light and live in the love of God. The author of <a href="/psalms/16.htm">Psalm 16, 17, 23, 25, 103, 119</a>, and a multitude beyond calculation, discerned and received him, walked in the light of the Lord, were kept in perfect peace, found in the Lord their most exceeding joy. "Like as a father pitieth his chihlren, so the Lord pitied them." He nourished and brought up children, and to the extent to which they appreciated his holy Name they therein received as a gift the capability and claim to call him their Father. This was not a question of human fatherhood or hereditary privilege at all, but of gracious exchanges of affection between these children of his love and the Eternal, who had fashioned them in his image and regenerated them by his Holy Spirit. To restrict any element of this passage to conscious faith in the Christ is to repudiate the activity of the Logos and Spirit before the Incarnation, and almost compels a Sabellian interpretation of the Godhead. Even now the grandeur of the biblical doctrine of the Trinity - a doctrine which treats these relations as eternal and universal - compels us to believe that whenever among the sons of men there is a soul which receives the Logos in this light, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apart from the special revelation of the Logos in the flesh, to such a one he gives the capacity and claim of sonship. John certainly could not mean to imply that there had never been a regenerated soul until he and his fellow disciples accepted their Lord. Up to this point in his argument he has been disclosing the universal and the special operations of the Logos who in the beginning was with God and was God, the Source of all life, the Giver of all light, the veritable Light which shines upon every man, which does more even than that - which made a long continued series of approaches to his own specially instructed and prepared people. Prophecy all through the ages has had a wondrous function to bear witness to the reality of this Light, that all might believe in it, that all might become sons by faith; but, alas darkness, prejudice, depravity, corruption - "darkness" did not apprehend the nature, name, or mystery, of love. And so he proceeds to describe the greatest, the most surprising, supreme energy of the Eternal Logos - that which illustrates, confirms, brings into the most forcible relief, the nature of his personality, and the extent of the obligation under which he has placed the human race; and proves in the most irresistible way, not only the character and nature of God, but the actual condition of humanity. The great extent of the literature and the imposing controversies which have accumulated over the entirely unique sentence that here fellows render any treatment of it difficult. A volume rather than a page or two is required to exhibit the significance of a verse which is probably the most important collocation of words ever made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
