This reflects the ongoing nature of divine revelation and the progressive understanding of God's will. The disciples, at this point, have been with Jesus for approximately three years, yet there remains much they need to learn. This is consistent with the biblical theme of gradual revelation, as seen throughout the Old Testament, where God reveals His plans and purposes progressively over time. The phrase also underscores the depth and richness of Jesus' teachings, which are inexhaustible and require time and spiritual maturity to fully comprehend.<p><b>but you cannot yet bear to hear it</b><br>Here, Jesus recognizes the limitations of the disciples' current spiritual and emotional state. The word "bear" suggests a burden or weight that they are not yet equipped to handle. This reflects the cultural and historical context of the disciples, who are still grappling with the concept of a suffering Messiah, contrary to the prevailing Jewish expectation of a conquering king. The disciples' inability to bear further revelation at this time is also indicative of their need for the Holy Spirit, who would later come to guide them into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). This connects to the broader biblical narrative of human dependence on divine assistance to understand and live out God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples during the Last Supper, preparing them for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, they are His closest followers who have been with Him throughout His ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus shares His final teachings and prepares His disciples for the events to come, including His crucifixion and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/progressive_revelation.htm">Progressive Revelation</a></b><br>Jesus reveals truth progressively, understanding that His followers grow in their capacity to comprehend spiritual truths over time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_the_holy_spirit.htm">Dependence on the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Believers must rely on the Holy Spirit for understanding and guidance, as He reveals and clarifies the truths of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_maturity.htm">Spiritual Maturity</a></b><br>Spiritual growth is necessary to grasp deeper truths.

Even after three years of intimate ministry, He still has &#8220;much&#8221; in reserve&#8212;truths about His atoning death, bodily resurrection, coming ascension, and the birth of the church (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>). This promise echoes His earlier statement, &#8220;Everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>), yet it also hints at deeper insights to be unveiled through the New Testament epistles (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but you cannot yet bear</b><p>The disciples&#8217; emotional and spiritual capacity is temporarily limited.

The Spirit will remind them of everything Jesus has said (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>) and disclose what is yet to come (<a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>).

The verse reminds us that revelation is progressive, reception requires spiritual capacity, and Christ meets His followers where they are while preparing them for greater understanding.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">I have yet many things to say unto you.</span>--The "many things" are defined by the next verse to be things with regard to which the Spirit of Truth shall be their guide--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> they are parts of the revelation which the minds of the disciples are not yet fitted to receive.<p><span class= "bld">Ye cannot bear them now.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/15-15.htm" title="From now on I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.">John 15:15</a>. The statements are not opposed to each other. On His side there is the readiness to impart to them as friends all things that He had heard from the Father. But revelation can only be made to the mind which can accept it; and for those who have only in part understood what He has told them there are many things which cannot now be borne.<p>Of what the "many things" were, we have only this general knowledge. They would include, doubtless, the doctrinal system of the early Church, and they would not exclude all the lessons which the spirit of God has taught the Church in every age.<p>The fact that there were truths which Christ Himself could not teach is a lesson which men who profess to teach in Christ's name have too seldom learnt. St. Paul found in it a rule for his own practice. He, too, fed men with milk because they could not bear meat. (Comp. Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?">1Corinthians 3:3</a>.) It is true, indeed, that no one can teach who does not possess a higher knowledge than that of his pupil; but it is no less true that no one can really teach who does not take the lower ground of his pupil's knowledge, and from that lead him to his own. Truths which the cultured mind accepts as obvious would appear no less so to the peasant if he were carefully taught them. Too often the weaker brother finds a stumbling-block in the very steps which should lead him to a higher truth, because he approaches them blindly, and without a guide. For the breach which exists between the higher Christian thought of our day and the faith of the masses of the people, Christian teachers are in no small degree responsible, and the only means by which the chasm may be bridged is to teach Christ's truths as He Himself taught them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-15.</span> - (b) <span class="accented">The power of the Paraclete on the disciples themselves</span>. From the twelfth to the fifteenth verse the relation of the Paraclete to the disciples themselves makes yet more evident the expediency of the glorification of the Son of man, and demonstrates the authority of the apostolic teaching. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Notwithstanding the abundance of the revelations which Christ had given, still, said he, <span class="cmt_word">I have many things yet to tell you, but ye cannot bear them now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at this epoch of your training. Christ (<a href="/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>, etc., in a passage which he proceeds to enlarge and deepen) has already said that the coming to them of the Paraclete would be one method of his own Divine approach to them for purposes of consolation and instruction; consequently he does not now allow them to suppose that, though separated from them by death, he would ever cease to instruct them. They could not in their present condition, and before the great events should have happened - events on which so much revealing fact would turn - bear the revelation of these "many things." Pentecost will enable them to appreciate the full mystery of love. The word used for "bear" is that which is used (<a href="/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>) to describe the bearing of the cross by Christ himself. Some have found in these "many things" new articles of doctrine which have been preserved by tradition; and others, a development of truths already presented in germ; and others, again, much of the future order of the world and the Church, such as gradually evolved itself to the vision and insight and spiritual wisdom of apostolic men. But they could not, on the eve of the Passion, have borne the full mystery of the atonement, or sufficiently have comprehended the glory of the enthroned King. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I still have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(ech&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
