Morning is frequently associated with renewal and hope, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where God's mercies are described as new every morning. The early morning setting also reflects the resurrection theme, as Jesus rose early on the first day of the week.<p><b>Jesus stood on the shore</b><br>The image of Jesus standing on the shore can symbolize His role as a guide and protector, watching over His disciples. The shore represents a place of transition between land and sea, symbolizing the boundary between the earthly and the divine. This setting is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God reveals Himself near water, such as the parting of the Red Sea or Jesus walking on water.<p><b>but the disciples did not recognize that it was Jesus</b><br>This lack of recognition can be seen as a test of faith and understanding. It parallels other post-resurrection appearances where Jesus was not immediately recognized, such as the road to Emmaus in <a href="/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13-35</a>. This theme emphasizes the spiritual insight needed to perceive Jesus' true identity.

There is obvious reference, in the manner of his approach, to that "standing" in the midst of them, with which they had become familiar (see <a href="/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14, 19, 26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> suggests something unusual, <a href="/john/4-27.htm">John 4:27</a>; <a href="/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the disciples knew</span> <span class="cmt_word">not that it was Jesus</span>. He is not walking on the waters as of old, but standing on the solid ground. Just as Mary of Magdala, and as the disciples on the way to Emmaus, and as even the disciples themselves on the Easter night, were in doubt, at first, who and what this manifestation might mean, so now the chosen seven fail to understand that which was before their very eyes. The morning mist and shadows adding to the obscurity produced by some hundred yards of distance, together with wearied and toilsome effort and a sleepless night, may suggest some explanation of the marvel; but the mystery is baffling. Two or three remarks may be made. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> These various appearances seem at first to confuse their perceptions by reason of the ordinary human characteristics that accompanied them. Mary for a moment mistook him for the owner or worker in the garden; the "two disciples" imagined that he was "a stranger in Jerusalem;" and these disciples think him, for the moment, to have been a stray wanderer by the lake-side. Their presupposition concerning the reappearance of their risen Lord would probably have involved some strange and awe-striking fulguration of his power; but the true "spiritual body" does, when it pleases, take on forms far more familiar. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The slowness of the process by which the apostles became finally convinced, against their prejudices and sense-bound views, that he had risen into a new form of living, and into new conditions of existence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Early in the morning,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#961;&#969;&#912;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pr&#333;ias)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4405.htm">Strong's 4405: </a> </span><span class="str2">Early morning.
