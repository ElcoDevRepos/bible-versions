In the cultural context of the time, attributing someone's actions to demonic influence was a way to discredit them. This phrase also highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, who often accused Him of being in league with demonic forces (see <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>). The crowd's statement reveals their inability to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, despite the signs and teachings He provided.<p><b>the crowd replied.</b><br>The crowd in this context likely consisted of a mix of local residents, religious leaders, and pilgrims attending the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem. This diverse group had varying levels of understanding and belief about Jesus. The crowd's response indicates a lack of awareness of the plots against Jesus by the religious authorities, suggesting a disconnect between the leaders' intentions and the general populace's perception.<p><b>&#8220;Who is trying to kill You?&#8221;</b><br>This question demonstrates the crowd's ignorance of the growing hostility from the Jewish leaders, who were indeed plotting to kill Jesus (see <a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>). It also reflects the disbelief and skepticism of the people, who could not fathom why anyone would want to harm someone who performed miracles and taught with authority.
