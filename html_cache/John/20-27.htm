Thomas, one of the twelve disciples, is often referred to as "Doubting Thomas" due to his skepticism about Jesus' resurrection. This encounter emphasizes Jesus' personal and compassionate approach to addressing doubt and disbelief among His followers.<p><b>Put your finger here and look at My hands</b><br>Jesus invites Thomas to physically touch His wounds, providing tangible evidence of His crucifixion and resurrection. The hands of Jesus bore the marks of the nails, a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, which speaks of the Messiah's hands and feet being pierced. This act serves as a powerful testament to the reality of Jesus' suffering and victory over death.<p><b>Reach out your hand and put it into My side</b><br>The invitation to touch His side refers to the wound inflicted by the spear during the crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>). This detail underscores the authenticity of Jesus' death and resurrection. The side wound is significant as it fulfills <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, where it is prophesied that the people will look on the one they have pierced.<p><b>Stop doubting and believe</b><br>Jesus calls Thomas to move from skepticism to faith. This command is not just for Thomas but serves as an enduring call to all believers to trust in the risen Christ. The Greek word for "believe" (pisteuo) implies a deep, abiding trust and commitment. This moment is pivotal, as it transforms Thomas' doubt into a profound declaration of faith, seen in his subsequent confession, "My Lord and my God!" (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>). This transformation highlights the theme of faith overcoming doubt, a central message in the Gospel of John.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who appears to His disciples, demonstrating His physical resurrection by showing His wounds.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thomas.htm">Thomas (Didymus)</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles, often referred to as "Doubting Thomas" due to his initial skepticism about Jesus' resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' followers who were gathered together when Jesus appeared to them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the disciples were gathered and where Jesus appeared to them after His resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead, which is central to Christian faith and the context of this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_evidence.htm">Faith and Evidence</a></b><br>While faith often requires belief without physical evidence, Jesus graciously provides Thomas with the evidence he needs.

He doesn&#8217;t wait for Thomas to come crawling with apologies; He addresses him directly, showing that the Good Shepherd seeks out every wandering sheep (cf. <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-16</a>). Just a week earlier, Thomas had insisted he needed proof (<a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24-25</a>). Now the risen Lord responds with personal attention, fulfilling His promise to know and care for His own (<a href="/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>). Christ&#8217;s willingness to engage Thomas reminds us of His patience toward those who struggle, much like His gentle restoration of Peter after denial (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Put your finger here</b><p>Jesus offers physical evidence. This invitation underscores the literal, bodily resurrection&#8212;no ghost, no metaphor (cf. <a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>). By presenting the nail-pierced flesh, He validates prophecy (<a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>) and confirms that the same body crucified on Friday is alive on Sunday. Thomas&#8217;s sense of touch becomes a bridge from doubt to faith, echoing <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a> where the apostles proclaim, &#8220;we have heard&#8230; we have seen&#8230; we have touched.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and look at My hands</b><p>Sight joins touch. Jesus engages multiple senses so the truth cannot be dismissed as illusion. Hands once extended in healing (<a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>) now bear scars testifying to the price of redemption (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>). Looking at those wounds invites every believer to recall the covenant love symbolized by <a href="/isaiah/49-16.htm">Isaiah 49:16</a>: &#8220;Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands.&#8221; The scars remain an eternal reminder of grace, even in glory (<a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Reach out your hand and put it into My side</b><p>The spear wound (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>) is still open proof. Jesus allows Thomas to probe the very place where blood and water flowed, which foreshadowed cleansing and new life (<a href="/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6</a>). The offer overturns the Roman guard&#8217;s conclusion of death and proclaims resurrection power (<a href="/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>). By inviting such intimate examination, Christ underlines that Christian faith stands on verifiable historical events, not secret mysticism (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Stop doubting and believe</b><p>A gracious command. Jesus does not shame Thomas but calls him forward. Doubt is treated as a condition to be cured, not coddled (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6-8</a>). The verb tense implies, &#8220;Be no longer unbelieving, but become believing,&#8221; signaling an ongoing choice. Faith is the only proper response to the risen Lord, aligning with <a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;faith is the assurance of what we hope for and the certainty of what we do not see.&#8221; Yet for Thomas, and for us through Scripture, the unseen has become visible (<a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a> shows Jesus personally meeting Thomas&#8217;s skepticism with tangible proof, affirming a literal resurrection and inviting a decisive move from doubt to faith. The scars validate prophecy, the physical interaction authenticates history, and the gentle command turns a doubter into a worshiper. The same risen Lord still seeks, shows, and summons every heart: examine the evidence, abandon disbelief, and believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Then saith. he to Thomas . . .</span>--This implies a knowledge of the words of <a href="/john/20-25.htm" title="The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.">John 20:25</a>, which in itself would carry conviction to the mind of Thomas. This repetition must have carried with this conviction a sense of shame at his unbelief.<p><span class= "bld">And be not faithless, but believing.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and become not unbelieving, but believing.</span> The words do not apply to the fact of the Resurrection only, but to the general spiritual condition of the Apostle. He was in danger of passing from the state of a believer in Christ to that of an unbeliever. His demand for the evidence of the senses was a step backward, a resting on the less, not on the more, certain. His Master would have him retrace that step, and become one who rests upon the intuition of the Spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>; delude, Vulgate; darnach, Luther) <span class="cmt_word">saith he to Thomas,</span> as though he had read his heart and sounded the depth of his complicated conflict between hope and fear, despair and love, and moreover intimating the fact that he had heard his disciple's protestations, as well as mercifully appreciated his genuine difficulties, and not unnatural hesitation, <span class="cmt_word">Reach hither thy finger, that organ with which thou wouldest test the reality of my being.</span> Do what thou wilt. <span class="cmt_word">See! my hands</span>; and as the word was spoken he spread before his doubting, loving disciple those hands which were nailed to the cursed tree, with all the signs of his great agony upon them still. Thomas had said that he must "see," and that he must touch - "lay his finger in the print of the nails." Here was the Divine opportunity for him, with more than one sense, to assure himself of the reality. <span class="cmt_word">And reach hither thy hand</span> (again the Lord quoted the very words in which the incredulousness of Thomas had been expressed), and put it into my side. He says nothing of the print of the nails, but offers the sacred privilege to the doubtful disciple. Thomas shall have the precise evidence he craved. The most hesitating of the entire group shall have the aid to his faith which he fancied indispensable in his particular case. How often has the unbeliever said, "If such or such evidence be not granted to me, I cannot, I will not, I by no means will believe"! Thus Gideon proved the Lord's willingness to utilize his feeble strength in delivering Israel from the Midianites; and even Ahaz was summoned by Isaiah to choose any sign whatsoever in heaven above or in the earth to prove the indestructible vitality of the true seed of Israel and real house of David. Consequently, we cannot say with Bengel, "Si Pharisseus its dixisset, 'nisi videro, etc.,' nil impetrasset sed discipulo pridem probato nil non datur." The Lord does sometimes offer exactly what we ask by way of proof; but we cannot know the precise effect it will produce, even when it is bestowed or when something still more explicit is actually provided for our weakness. Just as the cruel taunts which malice heaped or hurled on the name and work of our Divine Lord became wreaths of glory for his brow, so the cruel wounds which unbelief and bigoted hatred of goodness had inflicted on Immanuel became from that very hour the high, main, indelible evidence of his supreme victory. <span class="cmt_word">And become not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) what thou art in danger of becoming - the Lord does not say that Thomas's - <span class="cmt_word">faithless</span>, but that he runs the risk of ultimately becoming so through the dependence of his spirit upon the outward (so Meyer, Lange, Westcott, etc.); but be believing, faithful.
