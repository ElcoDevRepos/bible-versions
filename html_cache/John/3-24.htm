This timing is crucial for understanding the sequence of events in the life of Jesus and John.<p><b>been thrown into prison.</b><br>John's imprisonment is a pivotal event in the Gospels, marking the end of his public ministry and foreshadowing his eventual martyrdom. According to the Gospels, John was imprisoned by Herod Antipas due to his condemnation of Herod's marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife. This act of boldness and adherence to God's law highlights John's role as a prophet who speaks truth to power. His imprisonment also serves as a backdrop to Jesus' increasing prominence in His own ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A pivotal figure in the New Testament, John the Baptist was a prophet who prepared the way for Jesus Christ.

The remark shows that all that happened preceded that ministry, and equates the journey through Samaria with that mentioned in <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>. Even Hilgenfeld says, "<span class="accented">Involuntarily</span> the fourth evangelist here testifies to his acquaintance with the synoptical narrative." In our opinion it was designed and spontaneous. The first journey to Galilee, mentioned in <a href="/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>, was not the commencement of a public prophetic ministry, and the synoptists are silent about it. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, he "<span class="accented">withdrew</span>," shows that there was some reason for his abrupt departure, over and above what was stated. John gives the reason for the departure by <a href="/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 2</a>, where the conduct of the Pharisees was becoming more watchful and jealous. The authority which John here assumes to correct and enlarge apostolic tradition, reveals the claim of one who professed unique knowledge of inexpugnable facts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">(For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
