In the biblical context, light often symbolizes purity, truth, and divine revelation. Jesus' claim to be the light of the world connects to Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining on those living in darkness. The imagery of light is also significant in the creation narrative of Genesis, where God creates light to dispel darkness. Jesus' coming into the world as light signifies His role in revealing God's truth and providing spiritual illumination to humanity. This aligns with <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>, where Jesus is described as the life and light of men, shining in the darkness.<p><b>so that no one who believes in Me</b><br>This phrase highlights the necessity of faith in Jesus for salvation and spiritual enlightenment. Belief in Jesus is a central theme in the Gospel of John, where faith is portrayed as the means by which individuals receive eternal life (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The call to believe in Jesus is an invitation to trust in His identity as the Son of God and His redemptive work. This belief is not merely intellectual assent but involves a personal commitment and relationship with Christ. The phrase underscores the exclusivity of Jesus as the way to God, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life.<p><b>should remain in darkness</b><br>Darkness in this context represents spiritual ignorance, sin, and separation from God. The world, in its fallen state, is depicted as being in darkness, unable to comprehend or accept the light of Christ (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). Jesus' mission is to rescue humanity from this darkness, offering a path to reconciliation with God. The contrast between light and darkness is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the battle between good and evil, truth and falsehood. <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-14</a> encourages believers to live as children of light, reflecting the transformative power of Christ's light in their lives. The phrase serves as a warning against rejecting Jesus, as remaining in darkness leads to spiritual death and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus declares His purpose as the light of the world, emphasizing His divine mission to illuminate spiritual truth and dispel darkness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents the realm of human existence, often characterized by sin and spiritual blindness, into which Jesus enters to bring light and truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who place their faith in Jesus, who are called to step out of spiritual darkness and into the light of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/darkness.htm">Darkness</a></b><br>Symbolizes ignorance, sin, and separation from God, which Jesus came to overcome through His life and teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/light.htm">Light</a></b><br>Represents truth, holiness, and the presence of God, which Jesus embodies and offers to all who believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_as_the_light.htm">Jesus as the Light</a></b><br>Jesus' role as the light of the world is central to understanding His mission.

The evangelist had said, in his prologue, "In him was life," and the Life (the eternal Logos of life) was "the Light of men." All true understanding, all purifying, gracious influence shed on human affairs, nature, or destiny, are the issue and result of the Divine Life which, under every dispensation, has wrought in humanity. Above all, "the Light that lighteth every man," namely, that which has always and which ever will radiate from the life conferred on our humanity by the Logos, the life of God in mind and conscience, "came into the world" - came, that is, in a new and more effective form, came in the radiance of a perfect human life. The evangelist has sustained his teaching by quoting the solemn words of Jesus in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; also <a href="/john/9-5.htm">John 9:5</a>, where a special narrative of miraculous love typified both the need in which the human family, the sacred Israel, and even his own disciples, stood of light, and of the light which he could pour upon the sightless eyeballs. And now the connection of this passage is - You could not behold me if light did not stream forth from me. <span class="cmt_word">I have come</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">am come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, this has been and is my abiding purpose; cf. <a href="/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; <a href="/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>) <span class="cmt_word">a Light into the world, and</span> my object has been and is that <span class="cmt_word">whosoever believeth on me</span> - whoso-ever sees by the inward eye that which I really am, sees how my life stands related to the Father, whosoever assents to the new revelation thus given, even over and above the "<span class="accented">inward</span> light" of the Logos - <span class="cmt_word">should not abide in the darkness</span> which enwraps all souls; for, as said in the prologue, "<span class="accented">the</span> Light" (the archetypal Light) shineth upon the darkness of human nature, and the darkness comprehendeth it not." It should be especially noticed that in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a> St. Paul had grasped and uttered the fullness of this thought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
