The sour wine, or vinegar, was a common drink for Roman soldiers and the poor, highlighting the humility and suffering of Jesus. This act also signifies the completion of His physical suffering, as He fulfills the last of the prophecies concerning His passion.<p><b>He said, &#8220;It is finished.&#8221;</b><br>The Greek term "tetelestai" used here means "paid in full" or "completed." This declaration signifies the completion of Jesus' earthly mission and the fulfillment of all Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. It marks the end of the sacrificial system, as Jesus' death provides the ultimate atonement for sin. This statement also connects to <a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12-14</a>, where Christ's single offering perfects believers for all time.<p><b>And bowing His head</b><br>This action indicates a voluntary and peaceful submission to death.

Jesus' control over His own death is emphasized here, as He chooses the moment to surrender His life, aligning with His earlier statement in <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a> that He lays down His life of His own accord.<p><b>He yielded up His spirit</b><br>This phrase underscores the voluntary nature of Jesus' death. Unlike typical crucifixion victims who succumb to exhaustion or asphyxiation, Jesus consciously gives up His spirit, demonstrating His divine authority over life and death. This act fulfills His earlier promise in <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a> about raising the temple of His body, pointing to His resurrection. It also reflects the trust and obedience to the Father, as seen in <a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>, where Jesus commits His spirit into God's hands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is crucified for the sins of humanity.

The mighty work, undertaken by him who would realize the expectations of the oldest prophets and the unconscious prophecies of heathendom, was done. Every iota and tittle of the Law had been magnified. The reality of which the temple and the sabbath were shadows, the priesthood and the offerings innumerable were figures, had all been realized. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>! Consummatum est! From the ground of human nature, from the heart of the Man in whom all the wants, perils, sins, mysteries of the human race were gathered up, has gone the adequate admission of the righteous judgment of God against that nature in its present condition. Death itself becomes, not his shame, but his veritable glory. The sin of humanity is branded with an eternal curse, more deep than any previous manifestation of the Divine justice could have produced; and yet it loses its sting. God reconciles the world to himself by the death of his Son, by this curse thus falling upon his Only Begotten. The earthly judges are condemned by their Victim. The great and last enemy is itself wounded unto death. The Seed of the woman bruises the serpent's head when that Seed receives the bruise in its own heel. The Paschal Lamb is slain. The Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world. The prince of this world is east out. The reader must turn to the synoptic narrative for the other portents of the Crucifixion - the earthquake, the supernatural darkness, the rending of the temple veil, and the testimony of the Roman centurion. The silence of the Fourth Gospel concerning these events, on the supposition of its late orion, or on the hypothesis of the glorifying myth, or upon the suggestion that this evangelist was a theologizing mystic of the second century, who was merely fashioning the narrative to establish the doctrinal thesis of the Divine incarnation of the Logos, becomes entirely unintelligible. But the hypothesis that this eye-witness was supplementing other well-known narratives with particulars which came forcibly under his own observation, and made a deep impression upon his own mind, is suggested by every line.
