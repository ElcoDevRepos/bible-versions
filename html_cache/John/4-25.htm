Her identity as a Samaritan is significant due to the historical animosity between Jews and Samaritans. Samaritans were considered heretical by Jews because of their mixed heritage and differing religious practices, which included worship on Mount Gerizim instead of Jerusalem.<p><b>&#8220;I know that Messiah&#8221;</b><br>The term "Messiah" is derived from the Hebrew word "Mashiach," meaning "anointed one." This reflects the woman's understanding of Jewish and Samaritan expectations of a coming deliverer. Despite the religious differences, both groups anticipated a figure who would bring salvation and restoration.<p><b>(called Christ)</b><br>"Christ" is the Greek equivalent of "Messiah." This parenthetical note clarifies for Greek-speaking audiences that the terms are synonymous. It highlights the universal expectation of a savior figure, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers.<p><b>&#8220;is coming.&#8221;</b><br>The future tense indicates the anticipation and hope prevalent among the people of that era. This expectation was rooted in Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in Isaiah and Daniel, which foretold the coming of a redeemer.<p><b>When He comes,</b><br>This reflects the certainty and hope in the woman's belief. It underscores the widespread expectation of the Messiah's arrival, which was a central theme in Jewish eschatology. The phrase also sets the stage for Jesus to reveal His identity as the Messiah.<p><b>He will explain everything to us.&#8221;</b><br>The woman's statement reveals her belief that the Messiah would have divine wisdom and authority to clarify spiritual truths and resolve theological disputes. This expectation aligns with prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which speaks of the Messiah possessing the Spirit of wisdom and understanding.

"Father!" "Spirit!" what did all this mean? Was God in any real sense like the father who in childhood's happy days had protected, and forgiven, and loved? Was the divine nature in any real sense approached by human nature in its highest and best moments, when it seemed lifted above earth, and things of the earth? Was there for her a Father who could still forgive, a Spirit whom her spirit could still love, and in the grasp of that love lift itself to virtue and truth? How different are His words to any she has ever heard before! She, as others, feels half unconsciously their power. Her answer is also a question. He, whom her countrymen called "The Converter," or "The Returner," and expected from such passages as <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm" title="The LORD your God will raise up to you a Prophet from the middle of you, of your brothers, like to me; to him you shall listen;">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, and whom the Hebrews called "Messias," and Hellenists called "Christ," would come, and with Him the answer to every question. She uses the present tense, "Messias cometh." Can it be that He stands before her now? (Comp. <a href="/john/4-29.htm" title="Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?">John 4:29</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> <span class="accented">The Christ as conceived by Samaria.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - We probably do not possess here the whole of the conversation. It is clear, however, that strange presentiments of something more precious than any sanctuary, or any ritual, dawned upon the Samaritan woman. "A prophet" might tell her and her people <span class="accented">where</span> men ought to worship. The Prophet she discovered answered a desire for the "where" by revealing the "how" they are to worship. But there are many other lessons they need, and she gives expression to an idea of the Messiah, and of his coming, which startles us by its boldness. <span class="cmt_word">The woman saith unto him, I know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, I know as a matter of current opinion and with intuitive certainty) <span class="cmt_word">that Messias cometh</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which is called Christ</span>). [This parenthetical clause by the evangelist is the explanatory translation into Greek of the Aramaic word. This must be so, unless we could be certain, with Hug, Diodati, and Roberts, that Jesus and the woman were speaking Greek to each other.] The woman turns from a theme which she has partially understood. How should a woman have been able at a moment to discharge and dispense with the traditions of a life, and the prejudices hoary with age? We know that the Samaritans anticipated One who should be a "converter," or "restorer" (Gesenius, 'Anecdota Samaritana,' p. 65, translates the Samaritan word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> by <span class="accented">conversor</span> (so Ewald); Hengstenberg, Tholuck, Meyer, by <span class="accented">restitutor</span>), and cherished a hope of his appearance, upon the faith of the great promise (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>) that One would arise who would make known to them the Divine will. It is remarkable, but not unreasonable, that she should have adopted the Hebrew word in common use among all the Jewish people. In ver. 29 it is given in Greek without any reference to the original speech. Samaritans and Jews alike anticipated a <span class="accented">Christ</span> an Anointed One, a Plenipotentiary, a Guide. The more spiritual apprehension which follows becomes some explanation of the fact that our blessed Lord should have admitted to <span class="accented">her</span> what he afterwards, in Galilee, kept reticently in reserve. The Galilaeans would have come, on his slightest encouragement, and against his will have made him a king. This would have forced on him a position and dignity which, from their standpoint, would have wrecked his spiritual mission and frustrated his design. This woman, here and later on, made it obvious that her notion of the "Restitutor" or "Messiah" was One who, <span class="cmt_word">when he is come, will declare to us all things;</span> in ver. 29 One who can read the secrets of the heart, and knows her and others altogether; while from ver. 42 we learn that she and her friends were anticipating there and then "the Saviour of the world." Luthardt here points back to <a href="/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a> as part of the origin of the Samaritan idea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
