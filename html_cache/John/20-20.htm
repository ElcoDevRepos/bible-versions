This is significant as it follows His resurrection, a pivotal event in Christian theology. The context is the evening of the first day of the week, symbolizing a new beginning and fulfillment of Jesus' promise of peace and victory over death. The setting is a locked room, indicating the disciples' fear of the Jewish leaders, which underscores the transformative power of Jesus' presence.<p><b>He showed them His hands and His side</b><br>By showing His hands and side, Jesus provides physical evidence of His crucifixion and resurrection. This act serves as a confirmation of His identity and the reality of His bodily resurrection, countering any doubts the disciples might have had. The wounds are a testament to His sacrifice and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. This moment also prefigures the later encounter with Thomas, emphasizing the importance of faith and belief in the risen Christ.<p><b>The disciples rejoiced</b><br>The disciples' joy is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>, where He assures them that their sorrow will turn to joy. This joy is not just emotional but is deeply rooted in the realization of Jesus' victory over death and the hope of eternal life. It marks a turning point from fear to faith, from despair to hope, and from confusion to understanding of Jesus' mission and the coming empowerment by the Holy Spirit.<p><b>when they saw the Lord</b><br>Seeing the Lord is a profound moment of recognition and revelation. It confirms Jesus' identity as the risen Messiah and Lord, affirming His divine nature and authority. This encounter transforms the disciples, preparing them for their mission to spread the Gospel. It echoes the theme of sight and belief found throughout John's Gospel, where seeing Jesus leads to a deeper understanding and faith. This moment also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God revealing Himself to His people, as seen in theophanies throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

made possible by His completed work on the cross (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing matters. Peace is announced immediately after the Resurrection, demonstrating that the work is finished (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>) and the disciples now stand on the victorious side of the empty tomb.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He showed them His hands and His side</b><p>&#8226; Jesus offers tangible proof of His bodily resurrection.

Seeing the Lord changes everything&#8212;and His living presence continues to do so for all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">He shewed unto them his hands and his side.</span>--In St. Luke's account (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm" title="Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.">Luke 24:39</a>) we have "hands and feet."

Their <span class= "ital">joy</span> arose from the proof of corporeal identity which He had given them in the wounds. Their first impression was that they saw a spirit, and they were afraid, but the conviction that it was indeed the Lord, filled them with joy. (Comp. <a href="/context/john/6-19.htm" title="So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship: and they were afraid.">John 6:19-21</a>, and <a href="/luke/24-37.htm" title="But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.">Luke 24:37</a>; <a href="/luke/24-41.htm" title="And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here any meat?">Luke 24:41</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had said this</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when he had uttered all that was involved in his Divine salutation - <span class="cmt_word">he showed them his hands and his side.</span> Luke says "his hands and his feet;" John calls attention to the special wound in his sacred side, the making of which he had so closely described and verified (<a href="/john/19-33.htm">John 19:33-35</a>). Igor was this vision of the Lord restricted to the ocular testimony, to the bare fact of the Resurrection, but it was a solemn assurance that he, though risen, had died for them. He is the Living One that was dead, and is alive for evermore. He is in the midst of the throne, a Lamb as it had been slain. In his greatest glory neither does he nor can his people forget his sacrificial death. "He showed them his hands and his side." Some have argued, from John's silence about his" feet," that he intended to correct a general impression which the synoptic narrative had produced, viz. that our Lord's feet had been nailed to the cross. There is no reason whatever for any such hypothesis. The evangelist simply emphasizes the ghastly proof of his Lord's actual death, with its supernatural accompaniments, as a more vivid evidence of identity than the piercing of the feet: moreover, it was a fact to which he had borne special testimony. Some conception is given in both the Gospels of the marks and vestiges of the earthly pilgrimage which will survive death and pass on into the eternal world. <span class="cmt_word">The disciples, therefore, were glad when they saw the Lord.</span> In <a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a> we read that they were incredulous from the excess of their joy, and surcharged with wonder. In the bewilderment of their rapture he added to their assurance, and transformed their joy into faith by publicly and before them all participating in food. Extreme dejection is transformed into triumphant conviction of the truth. A new revelation had been made to them of the very nature of life, while the veil that had from the beginning of time concealed the abode of the blessed dead, had at length been rent in twain. They heard, they saw, they handled, the Word of life. They felt that in their Lord they too were now at home in both worlds. Their fellowship was with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He had said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eip&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
