The term "signs" is significant in John's Gospel, as it refers to miracles that reveal Jesus' divine nature and mission. These signs serve as evidence of Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the Son of God. The Gospel of John records seven specific signs, including turning water into wine and raising Lazarus from the dead, each demonstrating Jesus' authority over creation, life, and death. The use of "many other signs" suggests that Jesus' ministry was filled with miraculous works, underscoring His divine authority and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah.<p><b>in the presence of His disciples</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the eyewitness nature of the Gospel accounts. The disciples, who were with Jesus throughout His ministry, witnessed these signs firsthand. Their presence lends credibility to the Gospel narrative, as they could attest to the truth of the events described. The disciples' role as witnesses is crucial, as they were later commissioned to spread the Gospel and testify to what they had seen and heard. This aligns with the Jewish legal principle that a matter is established by the testimony of two or three witnesses, further validating the truth of Jesus' works and teachings.<p><b>which are not written in this book</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the selective nature of the Gospel of John. The author, traditionally identified as the Apostle John, chose specific signs and teachings to include in his account to convey a particular theological message. The purpose of the Gospel, as stated in <a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>, is to lead readers to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing, they may have life in His name. The acknowledgment that not all signs are recorded suggests that the Gospel is not a comprehensive biography but a theological narrative with a specific focus.

Note on <a href="/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>.) We must understand the "signs" not of the proofs of the Resurrection only, but of the works wrought during the whole life. The writer's narrative is drawing to a close, and he explains the fact that he has recorded so little of a life which contained so much. There were, indeed, many other signs which he, as an eye-witness, remembered, but which it was not within his purpose to relate.<p>That he refers to the whole work of Christ, and not to the Risen Life only, is clear, because (1) there were not "many other signs" during the forty days; (2) the words "did Jesus" are not applicable to the manifestation to the disciples; (3) the words <span class= "ital">"</span>in this book" refer to all that has preceded.<p>It would seem to follow from this that these verses (<a href="/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:">John 20:30</a> and <a href="/john/20-31.htm" title="But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.">John 20:31</a>) are the conclusion of the original Gospel, and that John 21 is to be regarded as a postscript or appendix.

Controversy has prevailed from the days of Chrysostom to our own, as to whether these verses are the summary and conclusion of the Gospel as a whole, or have special reference to the record only of the appearances of Jesus after his resurrection. It cannot be doubted that as St. John sums up in <a href="/john/12.htm">John 12</a>. the general teaching of Christ and its effect upon the people, to the termination of his public ministry, so at the close of this chapter, before recording the special bearing of the resurrection-life and spiritual power of Christ on the subsequent condition of the Church - a narrative of peculiar interest in itself, corresponding with the prologue of the entire narrative - he gathers up the general significance of his Gospel and its relation to other books. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many other signs therefore did Jesus also in the presence of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciples, which are not written in this book</span>. The "many" and "other" refer to those signs with which his readers may be familiar from other sources, and, as it seems to us, in other (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) books. We have seen throughout how thoroughly alive the evangelist is to the minutest details of the synoptic narrative. The word "many" seems most accurately to include more than the few appearances after his resurrection which are not mentioned by John, but which are recorded by the synoptists, and the "other" refers most probably to signs of a different class from those which he has selected. The "signs" written in this book are those central facts which formed the theme and starting-points of his discourses. "Signs" do not necessarily mean miraculous works (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>), but all "indications" or "tokens" of his higher nature and Divine commission, such as his appearance in the synagogue of Nazareth; the cleansing of the temple, which had so powerfully affected the mind of Nicodemus; the repeated assertion of his pre-existence and eternal glory; the feeling of the officers of the Sanhedrin, that "never man spake like this Man;" the effect produced by his lofty claims to be "Lord of the sabbath" and "greater than the temple;" the arrogation of power to forgive sins; the discomfiture of the deputation from chief priests and elders; the collapse of the Roman soldiers; and all other proofs of his supreme authority. All these <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> were not indispensably connected with corresponding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> "Before the disciples" suggests a special limitation and condition which took powerful hold upon the mind of the evangelist. We hear in one passage that "he could do no mighty works, because of their unbelief." To prepared minds he came with his spiritual revelations and special suggestions of heavenly origin. John sees the memories passing before him, which have already formed the heritage of the Church, and is reminded of "many ethers" which have never found a chronicler. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">performed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epoi&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
