The concept of "all things" being delivered into His hands signifies complete control and dominion, echoing the authority given to the Son in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where Jesus states, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me." This authority is rooted in the Old Testament, where the Messiah is prophesied to have dominion (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>). The phrase also reflects the fulfillment of God's plan, as Jesus is entrusted with the mission of salvation and judgment (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-27</a>). The imagery of being "delivered into His hands" suggests a transfer of power and responsibility, highlighting the trust and unity between the Father and the Son.<p><b>and that He had come from God</b><br>This phrase underscores the pre-existence and divine origin of Jesus. It affirms His identity as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and His unique relationship with the Father. The statement "come from God" indicates His heavenly origin and mission, aligning with passages like <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, where Jesus declares, "For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me." This connection to God the Father is central to understanding Jesus' role as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). It also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the coming of a divine Savior (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<p><b>and was returning to God</b><br>This phrase highlights the completion of Jesus' earthly mission and His impending return to the Father. It points to His ascension, as described in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>, where Jesus is taken up into heaven. The return to God signifies the restoration of His glory, which He had before the world began (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). This return is not just a physical departure but a spiritual triumph, marking the successful fulfillment of His redemptive work. It also assures believers of His continued intercession and preparation of a place for them (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>). The cyclical nature of coming from and returning to God emphasizes the eternal nature of Christ and His divine mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is aware of His divine authority and mission.

"Subsisting in the form of God, He thought it not a thing to be grasped at to be equal with God, but emptied Himself by taking upon Him the form of a servant, and being made in the likeness of men" (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6</a>).

John felt at this moment that the consciousness of Jesus was receding into the eternal self-consciousness of the Logos when he thus ventures to speak - <span class="cmt_word">that the Father</span> - in the great act of his generation - <span class="cmt_word">gave</span> <span class="cmt_word">all things into his hands, and that he came forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from God, and was going back</span> (<span class="accented">or, away</span>) to God, in the glory of his incarnation and the mystery of his death and resurrection. The whole of the incarnate ministry of Jesus was a separation, to some extent, from God, just as the close of it, in the death and resurrection, was a return to the glory which he had with the Father before all worlds. We must admit the extraordinary quality of the evangelist's assertion. He here throws back into the majestic manner of the Christ the hints which the subsequent discourse of our Lord must have given him of the Divine greatness which flashed at times from his sacred Person, and conferred a boundless significance on the subsequent act of humiliation. Christ gave the highest proof of his Divine self-consciousness in this display of his condescending love, this voluntary abasement to the lowest place in the household of faith. The use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> twice ever (vers. 1 and 3) is contrasted with the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> of ver. 7. The vast confessions here made are declared to be matters of absolute intuitive knowledge, not the results of long experience. Christ did not "come to know;" he "knew" all these facts about himself. It must not be supposed that this was a theological idea which came into the writer's mind afterwards. St. Paul, in the Epistle to the Philippians (Philippians 2:6-8), had adequately grasped the same thought long before St. John penned this Gospel (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] knew</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eid&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
