This setting underscores the public nature of Jesus' ministry and His role as a teacher. The temple was the heart of Jewish religious life, and teaching there would have been significant, as it was a place where rabbis and scholars gathered to discuss the Law. Jesus' presence in the temple courts highlights His authority and His fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, as He often taught with wisdom that surpassed that of the religious leaders.<p><b>near the treasury</b><br>The treasury was located in the Court of Women, one of the outer courts of the temple, where both men and women could gather. It was a place where offerings were collected, and it consisted of thirteen trumpet-shaped chests for different types of contributions. This location is significant because it was a busy area, ensuring that Jesus' teachings reached a wide audience. The treasury's proximity to the teaching area also symbolizes the connection between worship, giving, and the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke about the heart's condition in relation to wealth and offerings.<p><b>Yet no one seized Him</b><br>Despite the growing tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, no one arrested Him at this time. This indicates the divine protection over Jesus and the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan. The religious leaders were often angered by Jesus' teachings, which challenged their authority and interpretations of the Law. However, their inability to seize Him at this moment demonstrates that human actions are ultimately subject to God's timing and purposes.<p><b>because His hour had not yet come</b><br>This phrase refers to the divine timetable for Jesus' mission, particularly His crucifixion and resurrection. Throughout the Gospel of John, "His hour" signifies the appointed time for Jesus to complete His work of redemption. This concept emphasizes the sovereignty of God in the unfolding of salvation history. Jesus' life and ministry were orchestrated according to God's perfect plan, and nothing could happen outside of that divine schedule. This assurance of divine timing provides comfort and confidence in the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching in the temple courts.

The verse displays Christ&#8217;s fearless proclamation, the futility of human opposition, and the certainty of divine timing&#8212;assurances that still steady our faith today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">These words spake Jesus in the treasury.</span>--Comp. Notes on <a href="/mark/12-41.htm" title="And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.">Mark 12:41</a> and <a href="/luke/21-1.htm" title="And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.">Luke 21:1</a>. From the passage it is clear that the word "treasury" was applied to the brazen trumpet-shaped chests placed in the court of the women for the reception of alms. There were thirteen of them, and each bore an inscription showing to what purpose the alms placed in it would be devoted. Here the word is apparently used of the place itself in which the chests were deposited, or the preposition must be taken as including the immediate neighbourhood. This notice of place is interesting in many ways. The court of the women was one of the most public places in the Temple area. He taught, then, openly and fearlessly. The chamber in which the Sanhedrin held their session was between the court of the women and that of the men. They had on that very day been assembled to take counsel against Him (<a href="/context/john/7-45.htm" title="Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?">John 7:45-52</a>). This gives point to the words which follow, "and no man laid hands on Him, for His hour was not yet come." The court of the women, moreover, was the spot where the great candelabra stood. (See Note on <a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-30.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Further controversy with different groups, ending in partial admission of his claims by some.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These words</span> - an expression which emphasized the foregoing interview, and shut it off from the following context - <span class="cmt_word">spake he</span> (<span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in the treasury, as he taught in the temple courts</span>.

If so, it was in the "court of the women," or the place of public assembly most abundantly frequented by the multitude, and beyond which the women could not penetrate into the "court of the priests." Edersheim disputes Westcott's suggestion, that the <span class="accented">gazith</span>, or session house of the Sanhedrin, was close by, and that the language of Jesus was within earshot of <span class="accented">them.</span> This chamber, <span class="accented">gazith</span>, was in the southeast corner of the "court of the priests," and therefore far away from the treasure chamber. Supposing that the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was the treasury itself. the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> may point to the neighbourhood of the sacred enclosure. The reference shows that the locality even of the discourse had made profound impression on one of the disciples, and implies great publicity and imminent peril from these bold avowals. The clause added by the evangelist, <span class="cmt_word">And no man seized him; because his hour was not yet come,</span> is a phrase repeated frequently, and one which delays, by a strange refrain, the tragic consummation (see Introduction, &sect; VII. 5 (4)). Here it shows that some further attempt was made to lay violent hands on him, which for the moment failed. Seeing that avowals of his Divine nature wrought to a frenzy the passions of soma of his hearers, and finally led to his condemnation for a capital offence, the evangelist again and again shows that the Lord - who made these claims on his trial, as given in the synoptists - had frequently reiterated them at peril of his life. The language of the high priest shows how bitterly the ecclesiastical authorities resented this assumption. The Fourth Gospel makes the synoptic account of this matter more intelligible by showing us that it was not an isolated occurrence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He spoke</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#940;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elal&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2980.htm">Strong's 2980: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an otherwise obsolete verb; to talk, i.e. Utter words.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Tauta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">words</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8165;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(rh&#275;mata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4487.htm">Strong's 4487: </a> </span><span class="str2">From rheo; an utterance, ; by implication, a matter or topic; with a negative naught whatever.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">while teaching</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(didask&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1321.htm">Strong's 1321: </a> </span><span class="str2">To teach, direct, admonish.
