Angels often appear in Scripture as messengers of God, signifying divine intervention or revelation. Their appearance in white symbolizes purity and holiness, consistent with biblical depictions of heavenly beings (e.g., <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>). The presence of angels at the tomb underscores the significance of the resurrection event, marking it as a divine act.<p><b>sitting where the body of Jesus had lain</b><br>The angels are positioned at the location where Jesus' body was placed, emphasizing the reality of His physical death and burial. This setting within the tomb highlights the miraculous nature of the resurrection, as the body is no longer there. The empty tomb serves as a powerful testament to Jesus' victory over death, fulfilling His own prophecies about His resurrection (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>, <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-22</a>).<p><b>one at the head and the other at the feet</b><br>The positioning of the angels may evoke imagery reminiscent of the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-20</a>), which also faced each other over the mercy seat. This parallel suggests that Jesus' resurrection is the ultimate act of divine mercy and atonement, fulfilling the sacrificial system of the Old Testament. The angels' positions also frame the space where Jesus' body lay, emphasizing the completeness of His resurrection and the transformation from death to life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus who was the first to witness the empty tomb and the risen Christ.

This is to be regarded as a distinct vision to Mary, which, from the fulness with which it is recorded, we must suppose that she herself related to the Evangelist. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 379.) It rests, therefore, upon her testimony, and as a vision to her only may seem to be less certainly objective than the other appearances. Great caution is, however, necessary in estimating the truth of that which is wholly beyond the application of our ordinary canons of evidence. If we admit the earlier vision of angels, of which there were several witnesses, there can be no reason for rejecting this; and if the evidence was at the time sufficient to convince the Evangelist, who himself had seen no such vision, but was guided by the Spirit to accept and record this, as seen by Mary, we have a decisive judgment of higher authority than any which criticism can attain.<p>With the words "in white" we are, of course, to understand raiment.
