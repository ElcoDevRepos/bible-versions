In the context of <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3</a>, Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus about spiritual rebirth and the necessity of believing in the Son of God. The term "testimony" here is significant, as it underscores the importance of Jesus' words and works as a divine revelation. In the Jewish tradition, a testimony required two or three witnesses to be considered valid (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). Jesus' testimony is supported by the Father and the Holy Spirit, as seen in His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>). Accepting His testimony is an act of faith, aligning with the broader biblical theme of belief as a pathway to salvation (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>, <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>has certified that God is truthful</b><br>To "certify" in this context means to affirm or acknowledge the truthfulness of God's nature and promises. This phrase highlights the believer's role in acknowledging God's faithfulness and reliability. The concept of God's truthfulness is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing His unchanging nature and the certainty of His promises (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, <a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>). By accepting Jesus' testimony, believers are essentially declaring that God is trustworthy and His word is true. This act of certification is not merely intellectual assent but a deep, personal conviction that aligns with the biblical understanding of faith as trust and reliance on God (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of John, whose testimony is being referred to.

Earlier disciples, as Andrew and John (<a href="/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>), had passed from the Forerunner to the Great Teacher, and had heard in His words that which went to the divine in their own spirits, and had come from the short first meeting with the conviction, "We have found the Messias." They received the witness, and, as they heard it, they too became witnesses. Just as a man sets his private seal--here, probably, the common Eastern stamp that affixed the name is thought of--and by it attests the truth of a document, so they attested, in the power which that witness had over their lives, their recognition of it as truth. It has always been so. The moral fitness of Christianity to meet the spiritual needs of men, and its moral power over the lives of men in all the varying circumstances of culture, race, and creed, has raised up in every age an holy army of witnesses, who have set their seal to its divine truth.

It may even mean more than this, viz. that in Jesus "all the promises of God are Yea and Amen," that God is true in himself, and the witness of Christ embraces all that for which prophecy and promise and previous revelation had prepared the way (see Luthardt and Westcott). Such an idea is certainly beyond the scope of John's ministry or message. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
