Lazarus had been dead for four days (<a href="/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39</a>), emphasizing the power of Jesus over death. This event foreshadows Jesus' own resurrection and serves as a sign of His divine authority. The resurrection of Lazarus is a pivotal moment in the Gospel of John, demonstrating Jesus as the "resurrection and the life" (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>).<p><b>with his hands and feet bound in strips of linen</b><br>The burial customs of the time involved wrapping the deceased in linen strips, a practice common in Jewish culture. This detail underscores the authenticity of Lazarus's death and subsequent resurrection. The binding of hands and feet symbolizes the constraints of death, which Jesus overcomes, pointing to the liberation from sin and death that He offers.<p><b>and his face wrapped in a cloth</b><br>The face cloth, or "sudarium," was a separate piece used in Jewish burial practices. This detail is significant as it parallels the description of Jesus' own burial and resurrection (<a href="/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7</a>), where the face cloth is found separate from the linen wrappings. It emphasizes the personal and intimate nature of Jesus' miracles and His attention to detail.<p><b>&#8220;Unwrap him and let him go,&#8221; Jesus told them</b><br>Jesus' command to "unwrap him and let him go" signifies the complete restoration of life to Lazarus. It also symbolizes spiritual liberation, as Jesus frees individuals from the bondage of sin. This command reflects the authority of Jesus' word, which brings life and freedom. It also involves the community in the miracle, as they participate in the act of unbinding, illustrating the role of believers in supporting one another in spiritual growth and freedom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who performs the miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead, demonstrating His divine authority over life and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>The man who was dead and is brought back to life by Jesus.

But this seems not to be necessary, and if not necessary, is not to be resorted to. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/6-21.htm" title="Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land where they went.">John 6:21</a>.) The grave-clothes may have been bound round the limbs separately, as in the Egyptian mummies, and this would not prevent motion; or (and this is more probable) the body may have been "wrapped in a linen cloth," which encompassed the whole, except the head (<a href="/matthew/27-59.htm" title="And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,">Matthew 27:59</a>), but still left motion possible. The word rendered "grave-clothes" is used nowhere in the New Testament except in this passage. It means properly the bands or straps by which the linen sheet was fastened to the body, and which kept the spice from falling out. (Comp. <a href="/john/19-40.htm" title="Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.">John 19:40</a>.) We find it used elsewhere for straps and thongs generally. They were made of rushes, linen,, and other materials. The word is used once in the Greek of the Old Testament, where it means the belts by which beds are girded (<a href="/proverbs/7-16.htm" title="I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.">Proverbs 7:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And his face was bound about with a napkin.</span>--For the word "napkin," comp. Note on <a href="/luke/19-20.htm" title="And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:">Luke 19:20</a>. It means here the cloth placed round the forehead and under the chin, but probably not covering the face. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that</span> (had died and) <span class="cmt_word">was</span> (up to that time) <span class="cmt_word">dead, came out</span> (of the grave), <span class="cmt_word">bound feet and hands with grave-bands</span>. The swathing of the limbs after the Egyptian fashion, each limb separately, renders the action most natural, because <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is used. Lazarus did not simply stand in his grave. The early commentators and Stier saw in this emergence of the swathed Lazarus an additional miracle, just as they augmented the force of the supposition involved in the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, into the fact that our Lord raised from death a putrefy-tug corpse. Both suppositions would be unnecessary adjuncts of the proof of the glory of God and power of Christ. Lucke and others refer to the habit of swathing separate limbs, but in such a way as not to impede motion if the person thus swathed desired it. Meyer and Godet see no necessity for the suggestion of the early writers. Kuinoel thinks that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> was used of the mere struggle of the swathed body to escape. The above supposition is the most probable. So Westcott. (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the New Testament, is used of girdle or bandage.) <span class="cmt_word">And his face was bound about with a napkin</span>. The surrounding of the face with a <span class="accented">sudarium</span> is the touch of an eyewitness. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and suffer him to depart</span>; the part which bystanders might perform; this was the wise advice of Friend and Teacher. (For similar injunctions of a physical and practical kind on other occasions, see <a href="/luke/7-15.htm">Luke 7:15</a> and Luke 8:55.) The majestic miracle is no further pressed by the evangelist, but left to tell its own sublime meaning, which in the multiplicity of exegetical hypotheses we are in danger of missing. <p><span class="accented">"Behold a man raised up by Christ.<br />The rest remaineth unrevealed -<br />He told it not; or something sealed<br />The lips of that evangelist."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [man who]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
