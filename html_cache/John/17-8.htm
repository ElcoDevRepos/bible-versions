The words Jesus refers to are not merely His own but are given by the Father, emphasizing the unity and authority of the message. This reflects the prophetic tradition where prophets spoke the words of God (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). Jesus, as the ultimate prophet, fulfills this role perfectly. The transmission of divine words underscores the importance of revelation in the Christian faith, where God's truth is communicated through chosen messengers.<p><b>and they have received them</b><br>The disciples' reception of Jesus' words signifies their acceptance and understanding of His teachings. This acceptance is crucial for discipleship, as seen in the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>), where the good soil represents those who hear and understand the word. The act of receiving also implies a transformation, as the words of Jesus are not just heard but internalized, leading to a change in belief and behavior.<p><b>They knew with certainty that I came from You</b><br>This certainty reflects the disciples' growing faith and understanding of Jesus' divine origin. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus' miracles and teachings reveal His connection to the Father (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36-37</a>). The disciples' recognition of this truth is a pivotal moment in their spiritual journey, as it confirms Jesus' identity as the Messiah. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but is rooted in a deep spiritual conviction, often affirmed by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10-12</a>).<p><b>and they believed that You sent Me</b><br>Belief in Jesus as the one sent by the Father is central to Christian faith. This belief is not just acknowledgment but involves trust and reliance on Jesus as the Savior. The concept of being "sent" is significant in the Gospel of John, where Jesus frequently speaks of His mission and purpose (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, <a href="/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>). This mission is rooted in the Old Testament, where God sends prophets to guide and redeem His people. Jesus, as the ultimate fulfillment of this pattern, embodies God's plan of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is praying to the Father, expressing His role as the mediator who has faithfully delivered God's message to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who sent Jesus and gave Him the words to pass on to His followers.
