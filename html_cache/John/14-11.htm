It reflects the concept of the Trinity, where Jesus is fully divine and one with God. This unity is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John, as seen in <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, "I and the Father are one." The statement also echoes the Shema from <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, a central declaration of Jewish faith, emphasizing the oneness of God. Jesus' claim here would have been radical to His Jewish audience, who understood God as singular and transcendent. This assertion of divine unity is foundational for understanding the nature of Christ and His mission.<p><b>or at least believe on account of the works themselves</b><br>Jesus appeals to His miracles and works as evidence of His divine authority and identity. Throughout the Gospel of John, Jesus' works serve as signs pointing to His divine nature and mission, such as turning water into wine (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>) and raising Lazarus from the dead (<a href="/john/11.htm">John 11:1-44</a>). These works fulfill Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speaks of the blind seeing and the lame walking. The miracles are not just acts of compassion but are intended to reveal Jesus as the Son of God. This appeal to His works underscores the importance of faith based on evidence and experience, inviting believers to trust in Jesus' divine identity and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples, affirming His divine unity with the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father (God)</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, with whom Jesus claims an intimate and unique relationship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek to understand His divine nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_works.htm">The Works</a></b><br>Refers to the miracles and teachings of Jesus, which serve as evidence of His divine authority and unity with the Father.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_unity.htm">Understanding Divine Unity</a></b><br>Jesus' statement emphasizes the profound unity between Him and the Father.
