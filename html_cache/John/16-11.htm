Judgment in the biblical context often involves the discernment between righteousness and sin, and the ultimate accountability before God. In the New Testament, judgment is frequently associated with the coming of Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>). This judgment is not only future but also present, as Jesus' ministry brought a division between those who accept Him and those who reject Him. The concept of judgment is rooted in the Old Testament, where God is portrayed as the ultimate judge of all nations (<a href="/psalms/96-13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a>).<p><b>because the prince of this world</b><br>The "prince of this world" is a reference to Satan, who is often depicted as the ruler of the current age, exercising influence over the world and its systems (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>). This title underscores the temporary authority that Satan holds over the earth, which is characterized by sin and rebellion against God. The term "world" in this context refers to the fallen state of humanity and the systems that oppose God's kingdom. The notion of Satan as a ruler is seen in the temptation of Jesus, where Satan offers Him the kingdoms of the world (<a href="/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8-9</a>).<p><b>has been condemned</b><br>The condemnation of the "prince of this world" signifies the decisive victory of Jesus over Satan through His death and resurrection. This condemnation is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman is foretold to crush the serpent's head. The cross is the pivotal moment where Satan's power is broken, and his ultimate defeat is assured (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>). This condemnation is not only a future reality but also a present truth, as believers are called to live in the victory of Christ, resisting the devil and his schemes (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>). The assurance of Satan's condemnation provides hope and encouragement to Christians, affirming that evil will not prevail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Referred to as the Advocate or Comforter, who will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince_of_this_world.htm">The Prince of this World</a></b><br>A reference to Satan, who is described as having been condemned.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, who are being prepared for the challenges they will face after Jesus' ascension.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents the system of human society that is opposed to God and under the influence of Satan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Judgment</a></b><br>Jesus assures us that judgment is not a future possibility but a present reality.

The tense here is perfect, marking the completion of the condemnation. "The prince of this world hath been and remaineth judged." The conviction is regarded from the point of view of the coming of the Advocate when Christ's work shall have been completed. That work is the redemption of the world, and is, therefore, the condemnation of the prince of this world. The conviction of this judgment follows upon that of sin and upon that of righteousness. The two kingdoms stand out in clear distinction. The power of the prince of this world is overcome by the opening of the kingdom of heaven to all believers. The King of Righteousness is in victory seated upon His throne, and claims mankind, whose nature He has assumed and whom He has redeemed, to be free from sin and servants of righteousness.<p>It is not within the scope of these Notes to discuss the theories of interpretation, and the many difficulties which attend every interpretation of <a href="/context/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7-11</a>. All that can be attempted is to place the reader in possession of what seems to be the simplest meaning of the words. A more full treatment is the less necessary as a complete discussion of the whole subject is easily accessible in the Sermons of the late Archdeacon of Lewes, preached before the University of Cambridge, in 1840. The Notes attached to the Sermons are an exhaustive summary of the views held in ancient and modern times by men most capable of judging. (See J. C. Hare, <span class= "ital">Mission of the Comforter,</span> Ed 3, 1876.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- In respect of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</span> The conviction of sin will have a peculiarly and specially subjective cause; that of judgment will, like that of righteousness, be preceded by two stupendous objective facts - the exaltation of Christ and the judgment of Satan. The glorification of the Son of man, to the extent of his being declared to be the Son of God with power, will be the grand event which human nature will be powerless to counteract or ultimately to resist. "Know assuredly that this same Jesus whom you have crucified is both Lord and Christ." The judgment of the prince of this world is also a fact lying outside the politics of the world, which may fume and rage as it will; it is beyond the reach of the philosophy or literature, the courts or armies, the fashions or the force, of this world. The central prince and spirit of the world is judged by the Lord Jesus, and condemned; and the time is coming when the old standard of judgment will be cast out, and the world will be compelled to admit that it has been vanquished (<a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>). The conviction concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment, by the aid of the Advocate whom Christ will send, will become the great work of the apostles and of the Church, until he comes again in his glory. While commenting upon this sublime assurance the awful process must not be forgotten, nor the fact that the prince of the world dies hard. The atrocious wickedness which burst out after the exaltation of Christ among the people who had rejected their Lord, and the consummation of the mystery of iniquity in the Roman empire, was a part of the providential conviction of the world. Archdeacon Hare, in his ' Mission of the Comforter,' insists that the entire conviction of judgment, righteousness, and sin must be the work of "the Comforter;" that all the objective facts, all the teaching of example, all the thunder of prophecy, nay, all the outward demonstration of sin, righteousness, and judgment, made in and by the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ, must be complemented by the grace of the Holy Spirit on individuals, nations, and humanity at large; and that it is in the capacity of human "Comforter," or "Advocate," that this conviction is wrought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in regard to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">judgment,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(krise&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2920.htm">Strong's 2920: </a> </span><span class="str2">Decision; by extension, a tribunal; by implication, justice.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
