The unity between Jesus and the Father is a central theme in the Gospel of John, underscoring Jesus' divine nature. This relationship is also reflected in <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, where Jesus states, "I and the Father are one." The mutual indwelling signifies a profound spiritual connection, which was a radical concept for the Jewish audience, who were monotheistic and did not conceive of God in such relational terms. This statement challenges the disciples to deepen their faith and understanding of Jesus' divine identity.<p><b>The words I say to you, I do not speak on My own.</b><br>Here, Jesus asserts that His teachings and messages are not self-derived but are directly from the Father. This reflects the prophetic tradition in which prophets spoke the words of God, as seen in the Old Testament. Jesus, however, surpasses the prophets by being the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). His teachings carry divine authority, and this claim reinforces His role as the ultimate revelation of God. The statement also emphasizes Jesus' obedience and submission to the Father's will, a theme that is evident throughout His ministry, particularly in His prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>).<p><b>Instead, it is the Father dwelling in Me, performing His works.</b><br>This phrase highlights the indwelling presence of the Father in Jesus, which is the source of His miraculous works. The concept of God dwelling among His people is rooted in the Old Testament, such as God's presence in the Tabernacle and the Temple. In Jesus, the fullness of God dwells bodily (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>), making Him the new Temple. The works performed by Jesus, including miracles and acts of compassion, are manifestations of the Father's power and purpose. This underscores the divine mission of Jesus and authenticates His claims, as seen in <a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>, where Jesus refers to His works as testimony to His divine commission.<div

Mean</div><b>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?</b><p>Jesus begins by challenging the disciples&#8217; faith in His unique relationship with the Father.<p>&#8226; He is not merely close to God; He is literally &#8220;in&#8221; the Father, and the Father is &#8220;in&#8221; Him, a profound declaration of unity without confusion of persons (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<p>&#8226; This mutual indwelling reveals the mystery of the Trinity: one God, three distinct Persons, yet inseparable in essence (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Believing this truth is foundational for trusting everything else Jesus says and does. When Philip asked, &#8220;Show us the Father&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-8.htm">John 14:8</a>), Jesus could only point to Himself as the clearest revelation of God (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The words I say to you, I do not speak on My own.</b><p>Jesus&#8217; teaching carries divine authority because it originates in the Father.<p>&#8226; Every sermon, parable, and command comes straight from God&#8217;s heart (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49&#8211;50</a>).<p>&#8226; This undercuts any notion that Jesus is an independent prophet with personal opinions. Instead, His words are the Father&#8217;s words, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a> where God promised to put His words in the mouth of the coming Prophet.<p>&#8226; For us, this means the red letters are not optional advice; they are God&#8217;s unfiltered voice, worthy of absolute obedience (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Instead, it is the Father dwelling in Me...</b><p>The Father&#8217;s continual presence empowered Jesus&#8217; earthly life.<p>&#8226; Jesus remained perfectly in step with the Father&#8217;s will, never acting alone (<a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; This indwelling highlights why Jesus could promise the Spirit would one day dwell in believers (<a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>); the pattern is set in His own life.<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a> affirms, &#8220;God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him,&#8221; stressing that nothing of deity was absent from Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>...performing His works.</b><p>The miracles of Jesus are not separate from the Father&#8217;s activity; they are the Father&#8217;s direct works through the Son.<p>&#8226; Every healing, exorcism, and act of creation (<a href="/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1&#8211;11</a>) serves as the Father&#8217;s public endorsement of His Son (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the works belong to God, they perfectly align with His character&#8212;compassionate, purposeful, and revelatory (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>).<p>&#8226; This assurance comforts believers facing doubts: the same Father who worked through Jesus now works through the Spirit in the church (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a> reveals the inseparable unity of Father and Son in being, word, presence, and action. Jesus&#8217; identity is divine, His teachings are God&#8217;s own voice, His life is fully God-indwelt, and His miracles are the Father&#8217;s handiwork. Trusting this verse anchors our faith in the unbreakable bond within the Trinity and guarantees that everything Jesus says and does perfectly displays the Father&#8217;s heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</span>--Comp.

He had there taught this truth to the Jews; but Philip's words seem to show that even the disciples did not fully receive it.

Philip had heard in an inverted order these very words (see <a href="/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>). He might have grasped their meaning; two aspects of the same Divine truth or reality - the reciprocal fellowship between the Father and the Son, between the Father and the Effulgence of the Father's glory who is now the God-Man. I am in the Father, I the God-Man am in the Father, as the Logos has ever been in him and proceeding from him. I, who was forever in the bosom of the Father in heaven though on earth, am in the Father now, as the sun dwells in its own effluent light; and the Father is in me, seeing I am the Image of his substance, the Agent of his purpose, the Speaker of his words, the Doer of his works. The words (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) which I speak (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>, R.T.) unto you - those words which are "spirit and life" (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>), those "words of eternal life," according to Peter's grand confession (<a href="/john/6-68.htm">John 6:68, 69</a>) - I do not utter (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span>) from myself; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are the words of the Father, and also the proof that I am in the Father, but the Father worketh always and ever more in and through the Son, these works which may seem to be mine as the Son of man, but are the operation of the Father himself, he who abides in the Son. <span class="cmt_word">And the Father abiding in me, doeth</span> <span class="cmt_word">his works.</span> These works of mine (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) are all signs (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of my relation to the Father. They are indications to Philip of the nature, and quality, and character, and feeling towards him of the Father himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/14-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Do you not believe</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pisteueis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pistis; to have faith, i.e. Credit; by implication, to entrust.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I [am]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
