The making of a whip suggests preparation and purpose, not a spontaneous outburst. The whip, likely made from rushes or reeds found in the temple area, symbolizes authority and judgment. This act reflects the prophetic zeal seen in <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>, "Zeal for Your house will consume me," highlighting Jesus' commitment to the sanctity of worship.<p><b>and drove all from the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts, specifically the Court of the Gentiles, were meant for prayer and worship. By driving out the merchants and animals, Jesus restores the intended purpose of this sacred space. This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1-3</a>, where the Lord comes to purify the temple. It also prefigures the cleansing of the heart, a temple of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>.<p><b>both sheep and cattle</b><br>The presence of sheep and cattle indicates the commercial activities that had overtaken the temple area. These animals were used for sacrifices, and their sale was a convenience for pilgrims. However, their presence in the temple courts signifies the corruption and commercialization of religious practices. This cleansing act points to Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>He poured out the coins of the money changers</b><br>Money changers were necessary for converting various currencies into the temple shekel, required for paying the temple tax. However, their exploitation and exorbitant fees had turned a sacred duty into a profiteering venture. By pouring out their coins, Jesus condemns the greed and corruption that had infiltrated worship. This act echoes the call for justice and righteousness found in <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>.<p><b>and overturned their tables</b><br>Overturning the tables symbolizes the disruption of the corrupt system that had taken root in the temple. It signifies a radical reformation and a return to true worship. This action foreshadows the new covenant Jesus would establish, where worship is not confined to a place but is in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>). It also reflects the prophetic imagery of <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>, where the temple had become a "den of robbers."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

This feature of the Lord's action was not repeated at the close of the ministry. Observe that John singles out this punitive element in the first public appearance of the Lord for especial notice, and adds it to the otherwise resistless force which he was accustomed to wield by the glance of his eye or the tones of his voice. The "scourge," as Godet says, is a symbol, not an instrument. It was in Christ's hands a conspicuous method of expressing his indignation, and augmenting the force of his command, by an indication that he meant to be obeyed there and then. <span class="cmt_word">He drove them all out of the temple court</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, the intrusive sellers of the sacrificial beasts, the herdsmen, and traffickers. <span class="cmt_word">Also</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the sheep and the oxen,</span> which moved at once in a vast group, turning, fleeing to the great exits; and <span class="cmt_word">he poured out</span> on the ground, and with his own hand, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">coins</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the exchangers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), and overthrew the tables. "Christ had," as Hengstenberg says, "a powerful confederate in the consciences of the offenders." The presentiment of coming revolution and overthrow aided the impression produced by that majestic countenance and commanding glance, manner, and voice, that so often made men feel that they were utterly and absolutely in his power (cf. <a href="/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a>, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He made</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(poi&#275;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
