Walking implies movement and presence, highlighting Jesus' accessibility and willingness to teach and interact with those around Him. This action is consistent with His ministry, where He often traveled to various locations to preach and perform miracles.<p><b>in the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts refer to the outer areas of the Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and gathering for the Jewish people. This location is significant as it was a place where religious teaching and discussions often occurred. The temple courts were accessible to all, including Gentiles, making it a strategic location for Jesus to reach a diverse audience. The setting underscores the importance of the Temple in Jewish life and worship, and Jesus' presence there emphasizes His role as a teacher and His connection to Jewish tradition.<p><b>in Solomon&#8217;s Colonnade</b><br>Solomon's Colonnade, also known as Solomon's Porch, was a covered walkway on the eastern side of the Temple complex. It was named after King Solomon, who built the first Temple. This area was known for its grandeur and was a common place for teaching and gathering. The mention of Solomon's Colonnade connects Jesus to the wisdom and legacy of Solomon, a revered figure in Jewish history. It also serves as a backdrop for Jesus' teachings, linking Him to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the continuation of God's covenant with Israel. Solomon's Colonnade is later mentioned in Acts as a place where the early church gathered, indicating its ongoing significance in the early Christian community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching and performing miracles throughout His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The outer courts of the Temple in Jerusalem, a place where teaching and discussions often took place.

It was rather a cloister <span class= "ital">or</span> arcade than what we usually call a porch. It is said to have been on the east of the Temple, and to have been a relic of the original building which had survived all destructions and restorations, and had brought down its founder's name from its founder's time. (Comp. Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xx.</span> 9, ? 7.) It does not seem clear, however, that Josephus calls anything more than the eastern wall by the name of Solomon, and he calls the cloister above it simply the "Eastern cloister." It is more likely that the true position of "Solomon's porch" is to be found in one of the subterranean structures which existed in the time of our Lord, and exist now as they did in the time of Solomon. Caspari would identify the corridor under <span class= "ital">El-Aksa</span> with "Solomon's porch," and thus connect the place where our Lord walked at this feast with the Holy Church of Zion, and the place of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost. (<span class= "ital">Chron. and Geogr., Introd.,</span> Append. ? 22; Eng. Trans., pp. 297-9. Comp. Note on refs. in Acts.) The place as mentioned here is another instance of the writer's remembrance of topographical details connected with the Temple. (Comp. <a href="/john/8-20.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.">John 8:20</a>.) The fact that it was winter, and the fact that He was walking in this covered cloister or crypt, explain each other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</span> He walked in <span class="accented">Solomon's portico -</span> that part of the temple of Herod which the apostles afterwards adopted as the scene of some of their most explicit assertions of the gospel (<a href="/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a>; <a href="/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>). It was associated with the grandest events in their national history; for it was reared on the substructions of Solomon's temple, which even to the present day are intact (Robinson's 'Palestine,' 1:289; Palestine Exploration Society's Reports; 'Recovery of Jerusalem,' frontispiece, pp. 17, 226, 309-319). The Lord walked there because it was winter, and wintry weather. This reveals a little touch of the hand of an eye-witness. We need not ask for any more transcendental explanation. The note of time, moreover, implies that two months had elapsed since the Feast of Tabernacles. Wieseler calculates that the Feast of Tabernacles closed on October 19, and the Feast of Dedication began on December 20, and, if so, time is left for a portion of the Galilaean ministry cited in <a href="/luke/10.htm">Luke 10</a>. - 13. <a href="/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9-13</a> shows that the time referred to was after a period of heavy rain, and may account for Jesus walking in the shelter of the portico. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was walking</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#960;&#940;&#964;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(periepatei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4043.htm">Strong's 4043: </a> </span><span class="str2">From peri and pateo; to tread all around, i.e. Walk at large; figuratively, to live, deport oneself, follow.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
