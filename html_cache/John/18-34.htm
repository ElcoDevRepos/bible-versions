The question challenges Pilate to consider the source of his inquiry. This reflects Jesus' awareness of the political and religious dynamics at play. Pilate, as the Roman governor, represents the secular authority, yet he is entangled in the religious accusations brought by the Jewish leaders. Jesus' question implies a deeper probing into Pilate's personal understanding versus the influence of external pressures. This moment highlights the tension between personal conviction and societal influence, a theme prevalent throughout the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;Jesus asked,&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' role as the questioner here is significant. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus often uses questions to reveal deeper truths and to challenge the hearts of those He encounters. This method of teaching and revealing truth is consistent with His approach in other interactions, such as with the Pharisees and His disciples. It demonstrates His authority and wisdom, as well as His ability to discern the intentions of others. This interaction with Pilate is a pivotal moment in the Passion narrative, showcasing Jesus' composure and insight even in the face of impending suffering.<p><b>&#8220;or did others tell you about Me?&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the influence of the Jewish leaders in shaping Pilate's perception of Jesus. It reflects the broader theme of testimony and witness found throughout the Gospel of John. The Jewish authorities had accused Jesus of claiming to be a king, which they presented as a threat to Roman rule. Jesus' question points to the hearsay nature of the accusations and challenges the legitimacy of the charges against Him. This moment also connects to the theme of truth and false testimony, as seen in the trials of Jesus, and highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the suffering servant who would be misunderstood and falsely accused.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is on trial before Pontius Pilate in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea, who is questioning Jesus to determine the validity of the accusations against Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the ones who brought Jesus to Pilate, accusing Him of claiming to be a king.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_praetorium.htm">The Praetorium</a></b><br>The Roman governor's headquarters where Jesus is being questioned by Pilate.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trial_of_jesus.htm">The Trial of Jesus</a></b><br>This event is part of the larger account of Jesus' trial and crucifixion, a pivotal moment in Christian theology.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_authority.htm">Understanding Authority</a></b><br>Jesus' question to Pilate challenges the source of his information, prompting us to consider the sources of our beliefs and the authority we recognize in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_truth.htm">The Nature of Truth</a></b><br>Jesus' interaction with Pilate invites reflection on the nature of truth and how it is perceived and understood by different people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_witness.htm">Courage in Witness</a></b><br>Jesus' calm and composed demeanor before Pilate serves as a model for Christians to stand firm in their faith, even under pressure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_purpose.htm">Divine Purpose</a></b><br>The trial of Jesus, though unjust, was part of God's redemptive plan, reminding believers that God can work through difficult circumstances for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection.htm">Personal Reflection</a></b><br>Pilate's question to Jesus encourages personal reflection on our understanding of who Jesus is and how we have come to that understanding.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_18_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 18:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_18_34_Jesus_knows_Pilate_s_intent.htm">How does John 18:34 demonstrate Jesus' awareness of Pilate's intentions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_view_on_truth_and_authority.htm">What does Jesus' question reveal about His understanding of truth and authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_truth_in_talks_like_Jesus.htm">How can we discern truth in our conversations, as Jesus did in John 18:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_18_34_to_Proverbs_15_28.htm">Connect Jesus' response in John 18:34 to Proverbs 15:28 about answering wisely.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Use_Jesus_questioning_to_find_truth.htm">How can we apply Jesus' example of questioning to seek truth in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Is_that_your_idea_or_from_others.htm">What does Jesus mean by asking, "Is that your own idea, or did others talk to you?"</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_18_34_Belief_vs_Influence.htm">How does John 18:34 challenge the concept of personal belief versus external influence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_question_Pilate_s_view.htm">Why does Jesus question Pilate's understanding in John 18:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_thank_god_daily.htm">How often should we forgive others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_did_the_magi_observe_in_the_east.htm">What does 'One Shepherd and One Flock' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_mark_mention_two_rooster_crows.htm">Mark 14:72 -

Christ&#8217;s quiet yet sovereign inquiry invites sincere examination, exposes borrowed unbelief, and points to the greater kingdom where truth, not political expedience, reigns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</span>--The most probable interpretation of the question is that which regards it as establishing a distinction between the title "King of the Jews" as spoken by Pilate and the same title as spoken by Jesus. In the political sense in which Pilate would use it, and in this sense only the claim could be brought against Him in Roman law, He was not King of the Jews. In the theocratic sense in which a Jew would use that title, He was King of the Jews.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;{Are} you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(sy)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
