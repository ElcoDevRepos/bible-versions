The statement he heard was likely related to the claims about Jesus' identity, particularly that He was the Son of God. This would have been alarming to Pilate, as Roman culture was deeply intertwined with religion and the divine status of their leaders. The idea of a divine figure being judged by him would have been unsettling. Additionally, Pilate's wife had warned him about Jesus in a dream (<a href="/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19</a>), adding to his apprehension.<p><b>he was even more afraid</b><br>Pilate's fear was compounded by several factors. Firstly, the political tension in Jerusalem during Passover was high, and any unrest could lead to repercussions from Rome. Secondly, the Jewish leaders were insistent on Jesus' execution, and Pilate was aware of their influence over the people. Thirdly, the supernatural elements surrounding Jesus, such as His miracles and the claims of His divine nature, would have been intimidating to a Roman who believed in omens and divine retribution. Pilate's fear reflects the internal conflict between his role as a Roman official and the unsettling nature of Jesus' identity and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

Hearing that Jesus claims divine sonship raises the matter from a political charge to a spiritual one.<p>- Similar reactions surface elsewhere when earthly rulers face a heavenly claim&#8212;Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s unease in <a href="/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>, or Herod&#8217;s alarm when he thinks John the Baptist has risen (<a href="/mark/6-16.htm">Mark 6:16</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly shows that encounters with the notion of God&#8217;s direct intervention unsettle even the most powerful (<a href="/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he was even more afraid</b><p>- Pilate&#8217;s earlier fear is hinted at when he tries various compromises: sending Jesus to Herod (<a href="/luke/23-7.htm">Luke 23:7</a>), offering Barabbas (<a href="/john/18-40.htm">John 18:40</a>), and ordering a brutal scourging (<a href="/john/19-1.htm">John 19:1</a>) in hopes of appeasing the crowd.

He must have heard of some of the current impressions as to His life and words; he had himself heard Him claim a kingdom which is not of this world; his wife's dream (<a href="/matthew/27-19.htm" title="When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.">Matthew 27:19</a>) had furnished an evil omen which the superstition of the most educated classes of the Roman empire would interpret as a message from the gods; and now the Jews speak of Him as one who claimed to be the Son of God. (Comp. Notes on the words of the Roman centurion in <a href="/matthew/27-54.htm" title="Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.">Matthew 27:54</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - (f) [Within the Praetorium.] The fear of Pilate, and the apportionment of the measures of guilt by the majestic Sufferer. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When therefore Pilate heard this word he was more afraid,</span> implying that John had seen all along that some element of "fear" had moved Pilate, and that now it was augmented. Superstition goes hand in hand with skepticism. Instead of this being (as Keim says) contrary to psychologic laws, the history of skepticism is constantly presenting the same features (cf. Herod Antipas the Sadducee, who would dogmatically have repudiated the idea of resurrection, crying out concerning Jesus, "It is John the Baptist, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead," etc.). We need not suppose that Pilate was suddenly affected by the truth of Jewish monotheism; but he may readily have believed that the wondrous Being before him was enshrouded in a mystery of supernatural portent and pretension that he could not fathom, and before which he trembled. The idea of Divine energy enshrined in and wielded by human beings was not altogether foreign to heathen thought - and one centurion, at least, who was probably present on this very occasion, exclaimed that Jesus was a Son of God (<a href="/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
