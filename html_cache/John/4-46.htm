This return to Cana highlights the continuity of Jesus' ministry in Galilee, a region known for its mixed population of Jews and Gentiles. Galilee was a fertile area, often associated with agricultural abundance, which may symbolize spiritual fruitfulness. Jesus' repeated visits to Galilee emphasize His mission to reach the marginalized and those outside the religious epicenter of Jerusalem.<p><b>where He had turned the water into wine</b><br>This reference to Jesus' first miracle serves as a reminder of His divine authority and power over nature. The transformation of water into wine is symbolic of the new covenant and the joy and abundance it brings, contrasting with the old covenant's limitations. This miracle also prefigures the transformative work of Christ in the lives of believers, turning the ordinary into the extraordinary through His grace.<p><b>And there was a royal official</b><br>The term "royal official" suggests a person of high status, likely serving under Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee. This indicates the reach of Jesus' influence beyond the common people to those in positions of power. The presence of a royal official seeking Jesus underscores the universal need for Christ's intervention, regardless of social standing. It also reflects the fulfillment of prophecies that Gentiles and rulers would seek the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>).<p><b>whose son lay sick at Capernaum</b><br>Capernaum, located on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee, served as a central hub for Jesus' ministry. It was a prosperous fishing village and a place where Jesus performed many miracles and teachings. The mention of the official's son being sick highlights the human condition of suffering and the desperation that leads people to seek Jesus. This situation sets the stage for a demonstration of Jesus' compassion and power to heal, reinforcing His role as the Great Physician. The healing of the official's son also foreshadows the spiritual healing and life that Jesus offers to all who believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.

That earlier visit proved <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> true&#8212;&#8220;We have seen His glory&#8221;&#8212;and set Cana apart as a stage for revelation.<p>&#8211; Coming back shows the Lord&#8217;s deliberate pattern of reinforcing truth, much like later in <a href="/acts/14-21.htm">Acts 14:21-22</a> when Paul and Barnabas &#8220;returned&#8221; to strengthen disciples.<p>&#8211; From Galilee, Jesus will reach out to all Israel (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a> echoed in <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-16</a>), reminding us that God&#8217;s redemptive plan moves outward from places that seem insignificant to the world but are chosen by Him.<p>&#8211; Practical takeaway: Jesus often meets us again where He has already worked, building on past displays of grace rather than leaving them isolated memories.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where He had turned the water into wine</b><p>&#8211; John anchors the reader: this is the very site where Jesus&#8217; first sign &#8220;revealed His glory&#8221; and &#8220;His disciples believed in Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). The mention is more than geography; it links past faith to present need.<p>&#8211; By recalling the wine miracle, John cues us to expect another act that points beyond the physical to spiritual reality, fulfilling his purpose statement: &#8220;so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p>&#8211; That earlier sign demonstrated creative authority over nature (<a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>). The upcoming sign will display authority over sickness and distance, widening the portrait of His power.<p>&#8211; In both events, the Lord transforms crisis into celebration, paralleling <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-9</a> where the Messianic feast replaces mourning with joy.<p>&#8211; For readers, memory of God&#8217;s former works fuels current trust (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And there was a royal official</b><p>&#8211; The scene shifts from place to person: a basilikos, a royal servant of Herod Antipas. Status, wealth, or political influence cannot shield him from life&#8217;s fragility (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18-23</a>).<p>&#8211; His presence shows the magnetism of Jesus&#8217; reputation spreading beyond ordinary villages into the halls of power, fulfilling Simeon&#8217;s prophecy that Christ would be &#8220;a light for revelation to the Gentiles&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>).<p>&#8211; The royal official mirrors other figures of influence drawn to Jesus&#8212;Nicodemus (<a href="/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1-2</a>) and the centurion (<a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>)&#8212;illustrating that faith is not limited by social class.<p>&#8211; Approach to Jesus requires humility; his title is mentioned, yet his desperation overrides rank, echoing <a href="/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10</a>: &#8220;the rich should rejoice in his humiliation.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Application: no earthly authority grants immunity from needing Christ; all must come to Him on the same footing of dependent faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose son lay sick at Capernaum</b><p>&#8211; John personalizes the crisis: a child gravely ill about twenty miles away. The distance underscores that Jesus&#8217; power is not confined by location (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>).<p>&#8211; Capernaum, later called Jesus&#8217; &#8220;own city&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>), is already tasting His compassion (<a href="/luke/4-31.htm">Luke 4:31-41</a>). The official&#8217;s household will soon add to that testimony.<p>&#8211; The situation echoes <a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-24</a> where Elijah ministered to a sick child, pointing to Jesus as the greater Prophet (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>).<p>&#8211; Parental anguish becomes the backdrop for faith: the father will journey from worry to trust, prefiguring believers who &#8220;walk by faith, not by sight&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p>&#8211; For us, the verse assures that Christ&#8217;s concern reaches into our homes and touches loved ones even when they seem out of reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a> links Jesus&#8217; past revelation in Cana with a new crisis that draws a powerful man into humble faith. Returning to the town of the water-to-wine miracle signals continuity: the same Lord who turned emptiness into abundance will now turn sickness into life. A royal official, despite rank, discovers that only Jesus can bridge the twenty-mile gap to his dying son. The verse prepares us to watch Christ&#8217;s authority transcend both social status and physical distance, inviting every reader to trust Him afresh wherever our need is deepest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee.</span>--He returns to the place where He had manifested His glory and knit to Himself in closer union the first band of disciples. This thought is present to the writer as the reason why He went there. It was the place "where He made the water wine."<p><span class= "bld">And there was a certain nobleman.</span>--The margin shows the difference of opinion among-our translators as to what English word gives the true idea of the position of the person who is in the text called "nobleman." The Greek word is an adjective formed from the word for "king," and as a substantive occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It is frequent in Josephus, who uses it in our sense of courtier, or for a civil or military officer, but not for one of the royal family. The king, whose "king's man" is here spoken of, was almost certainly Herod Antipas, who was left the kingdom in his father's first will, and is called "king" by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/14-9.htm" title="And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.">Matthew 14:9</a>) and by St. Mark (<a href="/mark/6-14.htm" title="And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Mark 6:14</a>). The person here named may therefore be a "royalist" or "Herodian" (comp. <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm" title="And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.">Matthew 22:16</a>; <a href="/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>), but in a domestic incident like this the reference would be to his social position rather than to his political opinions. Perhaps "king's officer" represents the vagueness of the original better than any other English term. It is not improbable that the person was Chuza, and that his wife's presence in the band of women who followed Christ (<a href="/luke/8-3.htm" title="And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered to him of their substance.">Luke 8:3</a>) is to be traced to the restoration of her child. For the position of Capernaum, see Note on <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm" title="And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:">Matthew 4:13</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> of this verse is best explained by the simple supposition that Cana lay in his way. In Cana of Galilee, not Judaea, he had manifested forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him. He came, then, to Galilee, to Cana, and for a while tarried there, long enough for the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> to have heard of his healing power and prophetic gifts. There have been numerous attempts to identify this narrative of the nobleman's son with the healing of the centurion's servant as recorded in <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5</a> and <a href="/luke/7-2.htm">Luke 7:2</a>. Recently Weiss and Thoma have laid emphasis upon this identification. Strauss, Baur, and all the opponents of John's Gospel, are eager to press this subjective handling of the synoptic tradition. But, as Edersheim has observed, they are here in hopeless contradiction with their own theory; for we find that the Hebrew Gospel here confers the loftiest encomium upon a Gentile, and the Hellenic Fourth Gospel makes the hero of this scene to be a Jew. True, in both cases a man of higher rank than that of fishermen and taxgatherers approaches our Lord with a request on behalf of another. But it should be observed that in the one case we have a Roman centurion, a heathen man, coming with great faith, one who, though "not in Israel," recognizes the imperial claims of Jesus; in the present narrative we have an Herodian officer, some person of Jewish blood attendant on the tetrarch's court, who displays a weak faith, reproved though rewarded by the Master. The one asks for a dying slave afflicted with paralysis; the other for a dying son suffering from deadly fever. Jesus meets the centurion as he crones down from the mountain, after the delivery of the great sermon; the Lord, when he receives the request of the nobleman, was a resident in. Cana. Both cures are said to take place at Capernaum by the utterance of a word, but the centurion disclaims the right to a visit, and asks for a word only. The nobleman entreats that the Lord would travel from Cana to Capernaum to heal his son. Thus the two narratives, with certain resemblances, are still strongly contrasted.
