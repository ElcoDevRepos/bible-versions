The "brothers" refers to the early followers of Jesus, indicating a close-knit community. The rumor about the disciple not dying likely stemmed from a misunderstanding of Jesus' words, reflecting the human tendency to focus on sensational or miraculous aspects. This also underscores the importance of careful interpretation of Jesus' teachings. The disciple in question is traditionally understood to be John, the author of the Gospel, who lived to an old age, which may have fueled the rumor.<p><b>However, Jesus did not say that he would not die,</b><br>This clarifies the misunderstanding, emphasizing the need for accurate comprehension of Jesus' words. It serves as a reminder that Jesus' statements often had deeper spiritual meanings rather than literal interpretations. This correction is crucial for maintaining doctrinal accuracy within the early church. It also highlights the role of the Gospel writer in providing clarity and correcting misconceptions among believers.<p><b>but only, &#8220;If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reflects Jesus' sovereignty and authority over life and death, as well as His divine prerogative to determine the fate of His followers. The conditional "If I want" suggests that Jesus' plans are not always revealed to His disciples, emphasizing trust in His divine will. The mention of "until I return" alludes to the Second Coming, a central eschatological hope in Christian theology. This statement also serves as a gentle rebuke to Peter, reminding him to focus on his own calling rather than being concerned with God's plans for others. This teaching aligns with other scriptural themes of individual responsibility and trust in God's overarching plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who speaks to Peter about the future of the beloved disciple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter (Simon Peter)</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, who is concerned about the fate of another disciple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved_disciple.htm">The Beloved Disciple (John)</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be John, the author of the Gospel, who is the subject of the rumor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brothers.htm">The Brothers</a></b><br>Refers to the early Christian community or the disciples who spread the rumor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rumor.htm">Rumor</a></b><br>The misunderstanding among the disciples regarding Jesus' words about John's fate.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_on_your_calling.htm">Focus on Your Calling</a></b><br>Jesus' response to Peter emphasizes the importance of focusing on one's own calling and mission rather than being preoccupied with others' destinies.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_misunderstandings.htm">Avoiding Misunderstandings</a></b><br>The passage highlights how easily misunderstandings can spread within a community, urging believers to seek clarity and truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Jesus' words remind us that God has a unique plan for each person, and we should trust in His sovereign will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_rumors.htm">The Danger of Rumors</a></b><br>The spread of the rumor among the brothers serves as a caution against the dangers of gossip and assumptions within the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>The passage encourages believers to maintain an eternal perspective, focusing on Christ's return and the fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_21_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 21:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_21_23_clarifies_Jesus_words.htm">How does John 21:23 address misunderstandings about Jesus' words among believers?

The more familiar names of "disciples" and "children," "servants" and "apostles," are used in the Gospels. The Acts and Epistles introduce a new group of titles, e.g. "believers" as well as "brethren," "saints" as well as "disciples," "Christians," "slaves and soldiers of Christ," "sons of God," "priests and kings," and "little children;" but now, acting on the Divine hint of the Lord's own words, John speaks of his fellow-disciples who are called into the sacred fellowship as "brethren." The word went forth that that disciple dieth not (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "the disciple whom Jesus loved"). This was not an unnatural supposition, as his age advanced, and he was regarded as the "great light of Asia," the depositary of the latest traditions, as the link between the days of our Lord's ministry and two succeeding generations of believers, the seer of mighty visions, the enemy of all unrighteousness, and the apostle of love to the lost. In virtue of this very tradition, three hundred years later it was said that the holy apostle was still sleeping in his tomb at Ephesus, and that the dust moved lightly on his heaving breast (Augustine, 'Tr. on John,' 124:2). Here was the beginning of a genuine myth, which, having no real root in fact, failed to establish itself. "John the Baptist is risen from the dead," exclaimed Herod Antipas, "and therefore mighty powers energize in him." But there was no life and no truth in the story, and even among the disciples of St. John Baptist it did not take any place as a supposed fact. It is interesting to see that here a myth was started without positively bad faith, and based itself upon a recorded saying of the Lord; but it perished! The aged apostle strikes the folly dead with one stroke of his pen. The language is remarkable, as helping to prove that John wrote this chapter as well as the rest of the Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Yet</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said not unto him, that he dieth not; but, If I will that he abide while I am ever coming, what is that to thee</span>? Meyer, who always insists on the apostolic idea of the nearness of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, thinks that John does not decide here whether the rumor was true or false, and simply says it must, when he wrote, have been left still uncertain and unsettled (so Luther). The tradition is not authoritatively condemned; but it is shown to be a mere inference, one inference out of many, from words partially understood. The Epistles of John show how deeply John pondered the idea, and how much he crowded into the words, "abide in him," until the coming, and before and during and after the various comings of the Lord to him. Mr. Browning, in 'A Death in the Desert,' makes St. John say in his last hours - <p><span class="accented">"If I live yet, it is for good, more love<br />Through me to men: be naught but ashes here<br />That keep awhile my semblance, who was John -<br />Still when they scatter, there is left on earth."</span> <p><span class="accented">No one alive who knew (consider this!) -<br />Saw with his eyes and handled with his hands<br />That which was from the first, the Word of life.<br />How will it be when none more saith, 'I saw '?<br />Such ever was love's way: to rise, it stoops.<br />Since I, whom Christ's mouth taught, was bidden teach,<br />I went, for many years, about the world,<br />Saying, 'It was so; so I heard and saw,'?<br />Speaking as the ease asked: and men believed.</span> * * * <p><span class="accented">"To me that story - ay, that Life and Death<br />Of which I wrote 'it was' - to me it is; -<br />Is, here and now: I apprehend naught else.<br />Yea, and the Resurrection and Uprise<br />To the right hand of the throne -...<br />I saw the Power; I see the Love, once weak,<br />Resume the Power; and in this word 'I see'<br />Lo, there is recognized the Spirit of both<br />That moving o'er the spirit of man, unblinds<br />His eye and bids him look....<br />Then stand before that fact, that Life and Death,<br />Stay there at gaze, till it dispart, dispread,<br />As though a star should open out, all sides,<br />Grow the world on you, as it is my world."</span> In ver. 23 we find the significant close of the Fourth Gospel, and there is much to make it highly probable that the two remaining verses were added by the Ephesian elders, as their certificate of its authorship, and their identification of the beloved disciple with the author of the Gospel. It differs from the similar passage, <a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>, where the writer himself gives his own autoptic testimony to the great miracle of the spear-thrust; and where that testimony is declared by himself to be <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, "veritable," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> answering to the very idea of testimony. Here the person and verb are plural. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Because of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
