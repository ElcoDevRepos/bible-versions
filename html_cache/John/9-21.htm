The context is a miracle performed by Jesus, where He healed a man born blind (<a href="/john/9.htm">John 9:1-12</a>). The parents' statement indicates their fear of the Jewish leaders, who had already decided that anyone acknowledging Jesus as the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue (<a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>). This fear of excommunication highlights the social and religious pressures of the time, where being cast out of the synagogue meant losing community and social standing. The miracle itself is a fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened, pointing to Jesus as the promised Messiah.<p><b>Ask him.</b><br>The parents deflect responsibility back to their son, suggesting that he is capable of providing his own testimony. This reflects the legal practices of the time, where individuals were expected to testify on their own behalf. It also underscores the parents' desire to avoid conflict with the religious authorities. The act of asking the healed man directly is consistent with Jewish legal procedures, where witnesses were called to confirm events. This also emphasizes the personal nature of faith and testimony, as each individual must encounter and respond to Jesus personally.<p><b>He is old enough to speak for himself.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates that the man was of age, meaning he was at least thirteen years old, the age of legal responsibility in Jewish culture. This age allowed him to be a credible witness in legal matters. The parents' insistence on their son's ability to speak for himself further distances them from the controversy surrounding Jesus' miracle. It also highlights the importance of personal testimony in the Gospel of John, where individual encounters with Jesus lead to personal declarations of faith. The healed man's forthcoming testimony (<a href="/john/9-25.htm">John 9:25</a>) becomes a powerful witness to Jesus' divine authority and the transformative power of His miracles.<div

born blind, now sees. This is a straightforward acknowledgment of a literal miracle (<a href="/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6-7</a>). Scripture often links opened eyes with God&#8217;s direct action (<a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>), and Jesus&#8217; sign fulfills those prophecies (<a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4-5</a>). The parents&#8217; words confirm the reality of the work while distancing themselves from its explanation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or who opened his eyes</b><p>They refuse to identify Jesus as the healer. Though the man had already testified (<a href="/john/9-10.htm">John 9:10-11</a>), the parents are unwilling to reinforce that claim. Their avoidance parallels others who hesitated to confess Christ openly (<a href="/john/7-13.htm">John 7:13</a>; 12:42-43) because open allegiance carried real consequences (<a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>). The contrast between their silence and Jesus&#8217; unmistakable power highlights the decision every witness must make when confronted with the Savior&#8217;s works.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we do not know</b><p>Whether or not the statement is literally true, it functions as a protective dodge. Fear of expulsion from the synagogue overrides gratitude (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>). Their reluctance shows how social pressure can muzzle truth even when evidence is clear (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a> contrasts this with apostolic boldness). The verse warns that neutrality is not possible when Christ acts; silence can itself be a denial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ask him</b><p>Jewish law allowed direct testimony from an adult beneficiary, so the parents shift responsibility to their son. Personal witness remains the most compelling answer to skepticism (<a href="/john/9-24.htm">John 9:24-25</a>: &#8220;One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see.&#8221;). Believers today likewise carry first-hand stories of grace, urged to speak plainly when asked (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>). Delegating testimony reminds us that experience with Jesus is never secondhand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is old enough to speak for himself.</b><p>The man is accountable for his own confession&#8212;an echo of individual responsibility before God (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>; <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>). Faith cannot be inherited; each person must respond to Christ personally (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>). By emphasizing his maturity, the parents unintentionally spotlight the authenticity of his witness: an adult, competent, and uncoached.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-21.htm">John 9:21</a> shows parents caught between undeniable miracle and fear-based silence. They confirm the fact&#8212;&#8220;our son now sees&#8221;&#8212;but refuse to name Jesus, opting instead to defer to their son&#8217;s testimony. The verse exposes how social pressure can stifle truth, underscores the power of personal witness, and reminds every reader that, like the healed man, we are answerable for our own response to the light Christ gives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">But by what means he now seeth.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">but how he now seeth.</span> The answer is in the exact words of the question, which is not seen in our version.

The parents had some justification for their cowardice. They had no information beyond that which their son had given them. He had stumbled forth as usual on the morning of that sabbath, and bad returned home in transports of joy. Their son had doubtless told them the story (the use of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is significant).
