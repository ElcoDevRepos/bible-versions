Throughout the Gospels, Jesus often prefaces significant teachings with a declaration of truth, underscoring His authority and the reliability of His words. This phrase is reminiscent of the Old Testament prophets who spoke with divine authority, and it highlights Jesus as the ultimate prophet and teacher.<p><b>it is for your benefit that I am going away</b><br>Jesus speaks of His departure as beneficial, which may have been perplexing to His disciples. The benefit refers to the coming of the Holy Spirit, who would empower and guide the disciples in ways that Jesus, in His physical form, could not. This reflects the transition from Jesus' earthly ministry to the age of the Spirit, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a> about the outpouring of the Spirit.<p><b>Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you</b><br>The term "Advocate" refers to the Holy Spirit, also known as the Paraclete, a term that implies comforter, counselor, and helper. The necessity of Jesus' departure for the Spirit's arrival indicates the distinct roles within the Trinity. This aligns with the promise of the New Covenant in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God speaks of a new relationship with His people through the Spirit.<p><b>but if I go, I will send Him to you</b><br>Jesus assures His disciples that His departure will result in the sending of the Holy Spirit. This promise is fulfilled in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> during Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descends upon the apostles. The sending of the Spirit marks the beginning of the Church and the spread of the Gospel, empowering believers to continue Jesus' mission. This also reflects the unity and cooperation within the Trinity, as the Son sends the Spirit from the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_advocate.htm">The Advocate (Paraclete)</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who will come to guide, comfort, and empower the disciples after Jesus' ascension.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, who are being prepared for the transition from Jesus' physical presence to the spiritual guidance of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ascension.htm">The Ascension</a></b><br>The event of Jesus' departure from earth to heaven, which is necessary for the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coming_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Coming of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>A pivotal event in Christian theology, marking the beginning of the Church's mission empowered by the Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_jesus'_departure.htm">The Necessity of Jesus' Departure</a></b><br>Jesus' physical departure was essential for the spiritual empowerment of His followers through the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit acts as a guide, comforter, and source of strength for believers, continuing Jesus' work on earth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to trust in God's plan, even when it involves difficult transitions or changes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/empowerment_for_mission.htm">Empowerment for Mission</a></b><br>The coming of the Holy Spirit equips believers for the mission of spreading the Gospel and living out their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_by_the_spirit.htm">Living by the Spirit</a></b><br>Christians are called to live by the Spirit, allowing His presence to transform their lives and produce spiritual fruit.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_16_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 16:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Jesus_s_departure_beneficial.htm">Why is it beneficial for Jesus to go away according to John 16:7?

The Son of Man was to be glorified before the Spirit was to be given. Humanity was to ascend to heaven before the Spirit could be sent to humanity on earth. The revelation of saving truth was to be complete before inspiration was to breathe it as the breath of life into man's soul. The conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment could only follow the finished work of Christ. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-33.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(9)</span> <span class="accented">The promise of the Paraclete</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> - (a) The <span class="accented">threefold conviction of the world</span>. The extraordinary fullness of suggestion in the following words, and the strong opinions entertained by different theological schools, render interpretation a difficult task. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Though you are crushed with a sense of your approaching bereavement, and so imperfectly apprehend the conditions of your future power and the method which it is incumbent upon me to adopt for your consolation and the completion of my earthly work, <span class="cmt_word">nevertheless I tell you the truth.</span> It is wonderful that he who is the Truth itself should have needed, in such various forms, to have reiterated and affirmed the supreme right he possessed to claim their acceptance of his veracity. The truth, then, thus solemnly asserted, because in their then frame of mind it was so utterly unpalatable and incredible notwithstanding all that he had said - the truth is, <span class="cmt_word">It is expedient for you that I go away</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span> clause simply <span class="accented">defines</span> that which is expedient, profitable to the disciples. Many commentators, holding everywhere the relic force of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, say, with Meyer and Lange, that "<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> marks fact considered with regard to the purposes destined to be accomplished by it." Here, however, the profitableness to the disciples is the chief and solitary thought. "For you:" here lies the gist of the mystery. They might have accepted his own assurance that, bitter as the mode of his departure must be, yet they ought, to and would rejoice because he was going to the Father. How was it possible for them to rejoice so far as they were personally concerned? He answers the question, <span class="cmt_word">For if I go not away</span> - and surely this solemn departure meant, as he had recently told them, by the way of death and glorification - <span class="cmt_word">the Paraclete</span>, of whom I have spoken, the Spirit of truth (see <a href="/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26, 27</a>), will not come to you; but if I go (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;</span>, to my Father; observe the form of the two conditional sentences, the degree of uncertainty as to the issue, to be determined by the result), <span class="cmt_word">I will send him</span> to you (see notes on John 7:39. "The Holy Spirit," as the Divine dispensation of grace to men bringing a renewed humanity into living incorporation with its great Head, <span class="accented">was not yet</span>, <span class="accented">because Jesus was not yet glorified</span>). Jesus could not become the Divine Life-center of the human family, radiating from himself the full glory of a universal harmony, until he had been taken up, until he had been glorified in God. Unspeakably precious as many of our earthly gifts and friendships are, we do not apprehend them, nor profit by them to the full, until they are taken from us. The youth, submitted to the condition of perfect dependence on a parent's care and guidance, can scarcely ever reach the fullness of his manhood until he is thrown back upon the spirit of his father's counsel, apart from that father's presence, and brings into daily practice from a new standpoint the principles he has learned. So, without any hyperbole, nothing had ever been so wonderful and blessed to the human spirit as the fellowship which had prevailed between the Son of man and his disciples. They were with him, they sat at his feet, they watched his countenance, they experienced a continuous series of Divine surprises at his judgments and his mercies. They were walking by sight, as the children of Israel did, following the pillar of fire and cloud, and drinking of the living water; but they were nevertheless living by sight. Nevertheless, there was something more wonderful and gracious still, when, in his physical absence, they would have the sense of his spiritual presence. They would lose him as an earthly Friend, but they would regain him as a Divine Reality; they would discover more than his humanity in his God-Manhood. They would wield his Divine Word as their weapon, and would become the channels of his healing and convincing and judging powers. The promise, "I will send <span class="accented">him</span>," is the guarantee of something more than a "Christ after the flesh" could ever be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
