It reflects the intimate setting of the Last Supper, where Jesus is addressing His disciples, emphasizing His role as a teacher and leader.<p><b>Philip, I have been with you all this time</b><br>Philip, one of the twelve apostles, represents the disciples' struggle to fully comprehend Jesus' identity. The phrase underscores the duration of Jesus' ministry, approximately three years, during which He performed miracles and taught about the Kingdom of God. This time frame is significant as it fulfills the prophetic timeline and establishes Jesus' authority and credibility.<p><b>and still you do not know Me?</b><br>This question reveals the disciples' incomplete understanding of Jesus' divine nature. Despite witnessing His works and hearing His teachings, they struggle with the concept of Jesus as the incarnate God. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels, where Jesus' true identity is gradually revealed and often misunderstood.<p><b>Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father.</b><br>This statement is a profound declaration of Jesus' divinity and unity with God the Father. It echoes the prologue of John's Gospel, where Jesus is described as the Word made flesh. This connection is central to Christian theology, affirming the doctrine of the Trinity and the belief that Jesus is the visible image of the invisible God.<p><b>How can you say, &#8216;Show us the Father&#8217;?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the disciples' request for a physical manifestation of God. It highlights the spiritual blindness and lack of faith that can obscure the understanding of Jesus' divine nature.

The personal address to Philip highlights our relational Lord; the reminder of Jesus&#8217; long presence exposes spiritual dullness; the declaration that Christ perfectly displays the Father provides the ultimate answer to every search for God. Therefore, to know God, we study the life, words, and work of Jesus Christ, confident that Scripture&#8217;s portrait is complete, true, and sufficient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?</span>--More exactly, . . . <span class= "ital">hast thou not recognised Me,</span> as in <a href="/john/14-7.htm" title="If you had known me, you should have known my Father also: and from now on you know him, and have seen him.">John 14:7</a>. Comp. the reference in <a href="/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a>, from which it will be seen that Philip was one of the first-called disciples, and had occupied a prominent position in the band of Apostles. There is in our Lord's words a tone of sadness and of warning. They utter the loneliness of a holiness and greatness which is not understood. The close of life is at hand, and Philip, who had followed Him from the first, shows by this question that he did not even know what the work and purposes of that life had been. They speak to all Christian teachers, thinkers, workers. There is a possibility that men should be in the closest apparent nearness to Christ, and yet have never learnt the meaning of the words they constantly hear and utter; and have never truly known the purpose of Christ's life.<p><span class= "bld">He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.</span>--Comp.

Philip said to him, Come and see.">John 1:46</a>). The demand of Philip is one which is constantly being read, and the answer is one that constantly holds good. Men are ever thinking and saying, "Shew us the Father and it sufficeth us." "Give us something in religion upon which the soul can rest. We are weary of the doubts, and strifes, and dogmas which are too often called religion. We want something which can be real food for the soul. We cannot feed upon the husks which the swine do eat; and we believe that in the Father's house there is, even for the hired servants, bread enough and to spare. We are not irreligious, but we are impatient of what is put before us as religion. Give us truth! Give us life! Let it be free and open as the air of heaven, and we will gladly accept it, embrace it, live it." All this is the heart of the child seeking the presence of the Father. That Father has been manifested in the person of the Son. In the Life and Truth revealed in Him is the full revelation of God. In Him is the Bread of Life to satisfy every want of every man. He that hath seen Him hath seen the Father. How then can men say, Shew us the Father? (Comp.

Our Lord first of all appeals to that fact; and yet fact, reality as it <span class="accented">was</span>, the disciples had failed even to know <span class="accented">him</span>, inasmuch as they had not seen in him the Father. He thus confirms the statement of Ver. 7. "<span class="accented">There</span> is an evident pathos in this personal appeal the only partial parallels in St. John are cf. <a href="/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a> (Mary); <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a> (Simon, etc.)" (Westcott). There is no right understanding of Jesus Christ until the Father is actually seen in him. He is not known in his humanity until the Divine Personality flashes through him on the eyes of faith. We do not know any man until we know the best of him. How far more true is it of God and of the Father-God revealed in the Christ? <span class="cmt_word">He that hath seen me hath seen the Father</span>. The "seeing" here must be adequate, comprehensive vision. <span class="cmt_word">How</span> <span class="cmt_word">sayest thou</span> - emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">Show us the Father</span>? Philip, by the hints already given of him, might have discarded the Jewish and crude idea of a physical theophany. "How sayest thou?" reveals that sense of failure which Christ experienced when he sought to realize in the poor material of our human nature his own ideal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/14-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Philip,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#934;&#943;&#955;&#953;&#960;&#960;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Philippe)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5376.htm">Strong's 5376: </a> </span><span class="str2">From philos and hippos; fond of horses; Philippus, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have been</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#956;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(eimi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
