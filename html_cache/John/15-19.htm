In biblical context, "the world" often refers to the system of values and beliefs that are opposed to God. The world&#8217;s love is conditional, based on conformity to its standards. This echoes <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>, which warns that friendship with the world is enmity with God. Historically, early Christians faced persecution because they did not conform to societal norms, which often included pagan practices. The world&#8217;s acceptance is fleeting and based on alignment with its principles.<p><b>Instead, the world hates you,</b><br>The use of "hate" here is strong, indicating a deep-seated opposition. This reflects the reality faced by Jesus and His disciples, as seen in <a href="/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a>, where Jesus states that the world hates Him because He testifies that its works are evil. The cultural context of the time was one of religious and political tension, where the message of Jesus challenged both Jewish and Roman authorities. This hatred is not just personal but spiritual, as believers are seen as a threat to the world&#8217;s system.<p><b>because you are not of the world,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the believer's new identity in Christ. Being "not of the world" signifies a transformation that occurs through faith, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which calls believers to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. This transformation sets Christians apart, making them citizens of heaven (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>). Theologically, this separation is a result of being born again, a concept Jesus explains to Nicodemus in <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3</a>.<p><b>but I have chosen you out of the world.</b><br>The concept of being chosen is central to understanding the believer's relationship with Christ. This echoes the doctrine of election, where God selects individuals for a specific purpose, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>. Jesus&#8217; choice of His disciples is a reflection of God&#8217;s sovereign will, not based on human merit. This calling out of the world is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, where God promises to gather His people (<a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>). It also typifies the Exodus, where God chose Israel out of Egypt, symbolizing deliverance and a new identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, providing them with insight into their relationship with the world and their identity in Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who follow Christ and are called out of the world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>In this context, "the world" refers to the system of values, beliefs, and practices that are opposed to God and His kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_choosing.htm">The Choosing</a></b><br>This event refers to Jesus' act of selecting His followers, setting them apart from the world for a divine purpose.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, our identity is rooted in Christ, not in the world.
