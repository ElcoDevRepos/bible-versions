The piercing of Jesus' side by a Roman soldier was a customary practice to ensure death, especially in crucifixions, where breaking the legs was another method to hasten death. The Roman soldiers were experts in execution, and this act confirmed Jesus' death, countering any claims that He merely swooned. The spear's use also aligns with the Roman military practices of the time, where soldiers carried spears as part of their standard equipment.<p><b>and immediately blood and water flowed out</b><br>The flow of blood and water has been interpreted both medically and theologically. Medically, it suggests the rupture of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, indicating that Jesus was truly dead. Theologically, the blood and water symbolize the sacraments of the Eucharist and Baptism, representing purification and the new covenant. This imagery connects to 1 <a href="/john/5-6.htm">John 5:6-8</a>, which speaks of the Spirit, the water, and the blood as witnesses.

To cause death was not, then, the object in piercing the side; and yet it may have seemed to make death doubly sure. The word rendered "pierced" occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but it is certain, from <a href="/john/20-27.htm" title="Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.">John 20:27</a>, that the act caused a deep wound, and that the point of the lance therefore penetrated to the interior organs of the body. If the soldier stood before the cross, this wound would naturally be in the left side.<p><span class= "bld">And forthwith came there out blood and water.</span>--"Various physiological explanations have been given of this fact, such as--(1) that the lance pierced the pericardium, which contained a small quantity of watery lymph, which immediately flowed out; and also the heart, from which the blood flowed, the actual death taking place at this moment; (2) that the physical death of Christ resulted from rupture of the heart, and that the cavities of the heart and the surrounding-vessels contained a watery fluid; (3) that decomposition of the blood in the corpse had taken place, the solid matter being separated from the fluid, so that it would appear to be blood mixed with water. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/1_john/5-5.htm" title="Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?">1John 5:5-6</a>.)<p>Whatever solution we adopt, it is clear that death had taken place some time previously (<a href="/john/19-30.htm" title="When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.">John 19:30</a>), and that, while we cannot say which physical explanation is the true one, there is within the region of natural occurrences quite sufficient to account for the impression on the mind of St. John which he records here. We have to think of the disciple whom Jesus loved looking at the crucified and pierced body of his Lord, and remembering the picture in later years, and telling that there flowed from that pierced side both blood and water.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Instead,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
