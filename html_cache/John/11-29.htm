Her response is immediate upon hearing the news. This phrase indicates her attentiveness and readiness to act. In the context of the Gospel of John, Mary is portrayed as a devoted follower of Jesus, previously seen sitting at His feet (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>). Her actions here reflect her deep faith and connection to Jesus. The message she hears is from Martha, who has just spoken with Jesus, indicating the close communication and trust between the sisters.<p><b>she got up quickly</b><br>Mary's swift action underscores the urgency and importance of the situation. The Greek word used here implies a sense of immediacy and determination. This reflects the cultural context where family and community ties were strong, and responding promptly to a significant event was expected. Her quick response also highlights her eagerness to be in the presence of Jesus, whom she trusts deeply, especially in a time of grief over her brother Lazarus's death.<p><b>and went to Him</b><br>Mary's movement towards Jesus signifies her faith and reliance on Him during a time of mourning. Geographically, this takes place in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, which is significant as it sets the stage for the miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead. This act of going to Jesus is symbolic of seeking divine intervention and comfort. It also connects to other scriptural instances where individuals seek Jesus for healing and guidance, such as the woman with the issue of blood (<a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>). Mary's action is a type of the believer's journey towards Christ, seeking His presence and power in times of need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The sister of Martha and Lazarus, known for her devotion to Jesus.

The report carried by Martha (<a href="/john/11-28.htm">John 11:28</a>, &#8220; &#8216;The Teacher is here and is calling for you.&#8217; &#8221;) brings the voice of Jesus straight into the gloom of the mourning house.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly links faith with attentive hearing: &#8220;My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). Mary&#8217;s open ear shows she is one of those sheep.<p>&#8226; What she hears is reliable, personal, and urgent&#8212;three qualities that always mark Christ&#8217;s summons. Even in sorrow, she receives His word as trustworthy, just as <a href="/psalms/119-130.htm">Psalm 119:130</a> declares, &#8220;The unfolding of Your words gives light&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she got up</b><p>&#8226; Rising from a seated posture of grief, Mary physically shifts from mourning to movement. Her action pictures what Jesus will soon do for Lazarus&#8212;bring the dead to their feet (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>).<p>&#8226; Getting up is a choice; Mary refuses to stay immobilized. Compare the instant response of Simon Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law when Jesus healed her: &#8220;She began to serve them&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-31.htm">Mark 1:31</a>). Genuine encounter with Christ stirs immediate, tangible change.<p>&#8226; This verse reminds believers that hearing alone is incomplete. &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Mary&#8217;s rise models the proper pairing of faith and works.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>quickly</b><p>&#8226; John notes her speed, emphasizing eagerness, not reluctance. True obedience is prompt; delays signal divided hearts.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a> echoes the same spirit: &#8220;I hurried without hesitating to keep Your commandments&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Luke records similar urgency in Zacchaeus: &#8220;So Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed Him joyfully&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-6.htm">Luke 19:6</a>). The swiftness of Mary&#8217;s response testifies to her confidence in Jesus despite her unanswered questions about Lazarus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went to Him</b><p>&#8226; The direction of her movement is crucial&#8212;toward Christ. Comfort, answers, and resurrection life are found in Him alone (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). Mary personifies that invitation, taking her sadness straight to the Savior.<p>&#8226; Later she will draw even nearer, anointing His feet (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>). Her pattern&#8212;go to Jesus first&#8212;prepares hearts for worship and deeper revelation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a> affirms the promise inherent in her step: &#8220;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/11-29.htm">John 11:29</a> showcases Mary&#8217;s faith in motion: she hears Jesus&#8217; call, rises from sorrow, acts without delay, and moves directly toward Him. The verse illustrates how believers should respond to Christ&#8212;receiving His word with attentive ears, translating it into decisive action, doing so promptly, and setting our course straight toward His presence, where life and hope are found.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">She arose quickly.</span>--She was sitting in the house (<a href="/john/11-20.htm" title="Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.">John 11:20</a>), after the manner of mourners.
