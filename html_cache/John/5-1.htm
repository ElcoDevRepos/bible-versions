It highlights the narrative flow of the Gospel of John, which does not always follow a strict chronological order but focuses on thematic elements. This passage follows the healing of the official's son in Galilee, emphasizing the ongoing ministry of Jesus.<p><b>there was a feast of the Jews</b><br>The specific feast is not named, leading to various interpretations. It could be one of the major Jewish feasts such as Passover, Pentecost, or Tabernacles. These feasts were significant in Jewish religious life, serving as times of pilgrimage to Jerusalem. They also provide a backdrop for Jesus' ministry, as He often used these occasions to reveal His identity and mission. The feasts symbolize the fulfillment of the Old Covenant in Christ, who is the true Passover Lamb and the Light of the World.<p><b>and Jesus went up to Jerusalem</b><br>The phrase "went up" reflects the geographical reality that Jerusalem is situated on a hill, requiring an ascent. Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, making it a focal point for Jesus' ministry. His journey to Jerusalem for the feast underscores His obedience to the Law and His role as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets. This journey also foreshadows His ultimate sacrifice in Jerusalem, where He would fulfill His redemptive mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_the_jews.htm">Feast of the Jews</a></b><br>A Jewish festival, possibly Passover, Pentecost, or Tabernacles, which required Jewish males to go to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city, central to Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, where significant events in Jesus' ministry occur.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god's_commands.htm">Faithfulness to God's Commands</a></b><br>Jesus' journey to Jerusalem for the feast demonstrates His faithfulness to God's commands.

There is, perhaps, no Jewish feast with which it has not been identified, and it has been even proclaimed confidently that it must have been the Day of Atonement! (Caspari, <span class= "ital">Chron. and Geogr., Introd., Eng.</span> Trans., p. 130). Our reading is to be regarded as the better one, though not a few authorities insert the article, and interpret "<span class= "ital">the</span> Feast" to mean the Feast of Passover.<p>The time-limits are <a href="/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>, which was in Tebeth (January), and <a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>, which bring us to the next Passover in Nisan (April), <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> an interval of four months, the year being an intercalary one with the month VeAdar (and Adar) added, or, as we should say, with two months of March. The only feast which falls in this interval is the Feast of Purim, and it is with this that the best modern opinion identifies the feast of our text. It was kept on the 14th of Adar (March), in commemoration of the deliverance of the Jews from the plots of Haman, and took its name from the lots cast by him (<a href="/esther/3-7.htm" title="In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.">Esther 3:7</a>; <a href="/esther/9-24.htm" title="Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;">Esther 9:24</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It was one of the most popular feasts (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xi. 6, ? 13), and was characterised by festive rejoicings, presents, and gifts to the poor. At the same time it was not one of the great feasts, and while the writer names the Passover (<a href="/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a>; <a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>; <a href="/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a>), the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2</a>), and even that of the Dedication (John x 22), this has no further importance in the narrative than to account for the fact of Jesus being again in Jerusalem.

Suggesting a number of events, not necessarily connected with each other. (For the latter idea of a period expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> see <a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a> and John 11:7, 11; for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, see <a href="/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a> and John 21:1. etc.) <span class="cmt_word">There was the feast of the Jews.</span> Now, "the feast" of the Jews could hardly be any other than the second <span class="accented">Passover</span>, while <a href="/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a> would indicate a third. "The feast" referred to in <a href="/john/4-45.htm">John 4:45</a> undoubtedly means the first Passover. "A feast" would leave the question open, though by no means excluding positively the second Passover, as the anarthrousness of the word might be chosen with a view to call special attention to it. However, the indefinite <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> has been identified by commentators with every feast in the calendar, so there can be no final settlement of the problem. If the feast be the Passover, then our Lord's ministry lasted a little more than three years. If not, it must be one or other of the feasts that elapsed between the Passovers of ch. 2 and ch. 6 Edersheim, with many others, refuses to accept any chronological hint in <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, and therefore throws the journey from Jerusalem to Galilee a few weeks after the first Passover, in the early summer, and supposes that Jesus returned to the unnamed feast in the autumn. Several critics say of <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, one part of the sentence must be parabolical and the other literal, and that the disciples might be anticipating a spiritual harvest after four months, and Jesus drew from the physically ripening corn fields his comparison. This seems to me entirely contrary to our Lord's ordinary method; and that the disciples were in too carnal a mood to be credited with an anticipation of spiritual results in Samaria at all. Those who think that <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a> does give a hint of four months preceding harvest, place the journey between the middle of December and the middle of January. To my mind there is consequently no difficulty in imagining that when those four months should have been spent, and before the regular calling and appointment of the twelve apostles, our Lord should have gone up to the feast - one of the feasts which did summon the adult men to the metropolis. This is the view of Irenaeus, Luther, Cretins, Lampe, Neander, Hengstenberg, Conder, and many others. Wieseler, Hug, Meyer Lance, Godet, Weiss, Farrar, Watkins, think that the Feast of Purim, celebrated on the 15th of Adar (or March) (2 Macc. 15:36), in commemoration of the deliverance of the people from the evil intention of Haman (<a href="/esther/9-21.htm">Esther 9:21</a>, etc.), was that national fast and feast which Jesus thus honoured. Purim was not one of the divinely appointed festivals, but it is also stated that the Lord undoubtedly attended one of the national and recently appointed festivals, that of Dedication (<a href="/john/10-22.htm">John 10:22</a>). The more serious objection is that it could, if desired, have been celebrated quite as well in Galilee as in Jerusalem, and that the method of celebration seemed contrary to the whole spirit of the Master, and the whole tone of the discourse which followed. It is said that part of the ritual of the feast was the free and frequent gifts made spontaneously by one to another. Westcott prefers the autumn Feast of Trumpets as more suitable on several grounds than the Passover, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because of the absence of the article, - this, however, is very problematical (see Tischendorf, 8th edit.);  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Some time later</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">there was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
