Throughout the Gospels, Jesus often spoke in parables and metaphors, which required spiritual insight to comprehend. This lack of understanding is a recurring theme, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>, where Jesus explains that seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. The inability to grasp Jesus' message reflects a deeper spiritual condition, as Paul later explains in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God.<p><b>that He was telling them</b><br>Jesus consistently communicated profound truths about His identity and mission. In this context, He was speaking to the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders, who were often skeptical and hostile towards Him. The phrase indicates a direct communication from Jesus, emphasizing His role as a teacher and prophet. His teachings were authoritative, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>, where the crowds were astonished at His teaching because He taught as one who had authority.<p><b>about the Father.</b><br>The Father refers to God, whom Jesus frequently spoke about, emphasizing His unique relationship as the Son. This relationship is central to understanding the nature of the Trinity and the mission of Jesus. In <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-23</a>, Jesus explains His unity with the Father, asserting that He can do nothing by Himself but only what He sees the Father doing. This connection is further elaborated in <a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>, where Jesus tells Philip that anyone who has seen Him has seen the Father. The Jewish leaders' failure to understand this relationship underscores their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah and their lack of recognition of His divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the people and revealing His divine connection to God the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who often challenged Jesus and struggled to understand His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Referring to God the Father, whom Jesus consistently points to as the source of His authority and message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The setting for this discourse, where Jesus often taught and engaged with the Jewish leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_people.htm">The Jewish People</a></b><br>The broader audience, including both followers and skeptics, who were present during Jesus' teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_truths.htm">Understanding Spiritual Truths</a></b><br>Spiritual truths require spiritual discernment.

Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a>. Still the speakers then, and those spoken of now, are "the Jews" (comp. <a href="/john/8-13.htm" title="The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true.">John 8:13</a>; <a href="/john/8-22.htm" title="Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he said, Where I go, you cannot come.">John 8:22</a>); and they are probably in part identical with those of whom our Lord tells us there, that they knew neither Him nor the Father. Of these men St. John tells us now that they did not know that the Sender and the Father are one. The statement of their want of perception, which strikes us as so marvellous, is made just because it was marvellous. St. John remembers it many years afterwards, and remembers that on account of it Jesus proceeded to declare more fully that every act He did was done in the Father, and that every word He spoke was taught by the Father, and that in every event of His life the Father was present.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They understood</span> (perceived) <span class="cmt_word">not that he spake to them of the Father</span>. This difficult parenthesis of the evangelist calls attention to the fact that, during the immediately preceding discourse and controversy, Jesus had dropped his references to the Father, and had used the periphrasis, "he that sent me," probably suggesting to this strangely excited populace, fed with weird fancies and wild expectations, that the mysterious Being with whom they were conversing was but the Delegate of One mightier than he, who was hidden in the secret place of God's providence until the hour of his own manifestation should appear to have struck. They might have remembered the utter deference which the great prophet John had displayed before a Messiah whom as yet they knew not. They may have heard that even John himself, at a later date, sent from the prison two of his disciples to propound the query, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" in other words, "Art thou the final Manifestation of all that I have predicted and believed? or is <span class="accented">another</span> to make his appearance with fire and axe and available force to compel obedience and to secure universal homage?" It is more than probable that the evangelist, being personally alive to the cross currents of passion, enthusiasm, and hostility which were at work in the hearts of the populace, saw by the very blankness and confusion on their faces, and the "asides" of the multitude, that they had not perceived that Jesus was throughout in these references speaking of <span class="accented">the Father of all</span> - the supreme Source of all power, the Lord of hosts. Even when he had said, "Ye have not known me, nor my Father," they had not risen to such a conception of the Lord's meaning as to suppose that the supreme Father himself was being suggested to them and cited as the corroborative Witness, as the supernatural Aid and Divine Presence which was giving validity to all that Christ has said about himself. Their ignorance and lack of perception need not astonish us when we reflect upon the obscurity and non-receptivity of the apostles themselves, and the like obtuseness of theologians and cultivated men of the world in every age from that day to this. The remark is, moreover, added doubtless to interpret the following verses, in which the ideas of ver. 26 are repeated, with the difference that, whereas he had already spoken of him that sent him, and who had authorized his words and judgments, Jesus now gives to him the beloved name of "the Father." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They did not understand</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(egn&#333;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He was telling</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
