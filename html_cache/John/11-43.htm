This moment is set in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, which is significant as it is close to the religious epicenter of Judaism. The context is a demonstration of Jesus' power over death, foreshadowing His own resurrection. This event is a pivotal moment in the Gospel of John, showcasing Jesus' divine authority.<p><b>He called out in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice signifies authority and command, reminiscent of God's creative power in Genesis where He speaks creation into existence. This act is public, ensuring that witnesses can attest to the miracle. The loud voice also contrasts with the typical quietness associated with death, emphasizing the life-giving power of Jesus' words. This moment is a direct challenge to the finality of death, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible.<p><b>&#8220;Lazarus, come out!&#8221;</b><br>The specific calling of Lazarus by name underscores the personal nature of Jesus' miracles and His intimate knowledge of individuals. This command is a direct act of resurrection, prefiguring the final resurrection at the end of times as described in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>. Lazarus' emergence from the tomb is a type of Christ's own resurrection, illustrating Jesus as the source of life and victory over death.

These verses lead to the opinion that it was at the moment of the cry, and not before, as some have thought, that life returned. This is the only passage where the word rendered "cried" is used of our Lord. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/12-19.htm" title="He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.">Matthew 12:19</a>.)

The loud voice keeps up the image that death is a deep sleep. The critical moment in Christ's own career has arrived, when, having pledged the rather to this manifestation of his own glory, he was prepared to take this final step, however perilous to himself; one which would finally demonstrate whether he was sent from God, or was merely boasting a power he did not possess (cf. Elijah and the priests of Baal, <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>.).

Meyer and Alford condemn this. It seems to me that this supposition. somewhat modified as above, throws light upon vers. 41, 42.) The words themselves are applicable to a grave from which the stone door had been removed. Weiss has made some admirable remarks on the use made by the T&uuml;bingen critics of this admission. In many cases in which such miracles took place the soul had obviously not left the body, but yet the entire surroundings here imply that, apart from miraculous energy, resuscitation was absolutely un-looked for. Even Strauss refuses utterly the trance hypothesis, and Renan has renounced the farcical drama that he thought at one time might account for the event and its record. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After Jesus] had said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eip&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
