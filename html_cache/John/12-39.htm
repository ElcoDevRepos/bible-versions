The inability to believe is not due to a lack of evidence or opportunity but is a fulfillment of divine prophecy and judgment. This echoes the hardening of Pharaoh's heart in Exodus, where God allows individuals to persist in their unbelief as a form of judgment. Theologically, this raises questions about free will and divine sovereignty, suggesting that persistent rejection of God can lead to a state where belief becomes impossible. This is consistent with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes the importance of responding to God's revelation while it is available.<p><b>For again, Isaiah says:</b><br>This phrase introduces a quotation from the prophet Isaiah, specifically <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>, which is frequently referenced in the New Testament to explain the unbelief of the Jewish people. Isaiah's ministry occurred during a time of national apostasy in Israel, and his message was one of judgment and hope. The use of Isaiah here underscores the continuity of God's plan throughout the Old and New Testaments. It also highlights the prophetic nature of Isaiah's writings, which not only addressed his contemporary audience but also pointed forward to the time of Christ. This connection between Isaiah and the Gospel of John emphasizes the fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus' ministry and the persistent unbelief of many despite the clear signs and teachings He provided.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, whose teachings and miracles are being recounted.

In verse 38, John quotes <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, &#8220;Lord, who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&#8221;. The &#8220;reason&#8221; is therefore twofold:<p>&#8226; Persistent unbelief despite clear revelation (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36-40</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophetic pattern that God had already foretold through <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>&#8212;Israel&#8217;s Messiah would be rejected first, then glorified.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were unable to believe</b><p>These sobering words stress inability, not just unwillingness. Scripture presents two interwoven truths:<p>&#8226; Human responsibility&#8212;people freely reject the light they have (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>; <a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine judgment&#8212;continued rejection results in God confirming their hardness (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-28</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-11</a>).<p>John has already shown both truths together: &#8220;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>), yet &#8220;you refuse to come to Me to have life&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-40.htm">John 5:40</a>). Their inability is moral and spiritual, a heart hardened by repeated unbelief until God judicially lets blindness set in (<a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For again</b><p>The words &#8220;for again&#8221; introduce another quotation from Isaiah, showing that this hardening was foretold more than once. John ties Jesus&#8217; ministry to a recurring Old Testament theme: whenever God&#8217;s Word comes with power, some receive life while others are confirmed in their rebellion (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9-10</a>). &#8220;Again&#8221; signals continuity; history is repeating itself in Jesus&#8217; day just as it did in Isaiah&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Isaiah says:</b><p>John will quote <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a> in verse 40: &#8220;He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they cannot see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them&#8221;. In <a href="/bsb/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>, the prophet&#8217;s commission came after the nation had already resisted God&#8217;s calls to repentance (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2-4</a>; 5:24-25). By citing this passage, John teaches that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty directs even the tragic outcome of unbelief (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Hardened hearts serve a larger redemptive plan, opening the door for the gospel to reach the nations (<a href="/acts/28-25.htm">Acts 28:25-28</a>; <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the door of mercy remains open for any who will humble themselves (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6-7</a>; <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/12-39.htm">John 12:39</a> explains that long-standing unbelief led to God&#8217;s judicial hardening, exactly as Isaiah had prophesied. People rejected clear light, and God confirmed that choice, weaving it into His larger redemptive purposes. Even in this sobering verse, the gospel call still rings out: respond to the light while it is given, for the same Word that softens believing hearts will also harden those who persist in rejecting it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">Therefore they could not believe, because.</span>--The words refer to those which have gone before, not to those which follow, and then by an addition give the reason more fully. "It was on account of the divine will expressed in Isaiah's prophecy." "It was therefore, namely, because Isaiah said again."<p>The words, "they could not believe," must be taken in their plain meaning as expressing impossibility. The Apostle is looking back upon the national rejection of Christ, and seeks a reason for it. He remembers how our Lord Himself had explained His method of teaching by parables, and has based it upon this prophecy of Isaiah (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm" title="And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:">Matthew 13:14</a>). The principle was that which has been repeated in His last public words (<a href="/context/john/12-35.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come on you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.">John 12:35-36</a>); that power used is increased, and power neglected destroys itself. Here, then, in these prophetic words was the reason they could not believe. Wilful rejection had been followed by rejection which was no longer within the power of the will. With this statement of St. John's should be compared our Lord's words on the same subject in <a href="/john/5-40.htm" title="And you will not come to me, that you might have life.">John 5:40</a>; <a href="/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>, Notes, and St. Paul's arguments in Romans 9-11.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 39, 40.</span> - In these verses, however, a deeper difficulty still is involved. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> leave us no option (see <a href="/john/7-21.htm">John 7:21, 22</a>) but to translate: <span class="cmt_word">For from this reason they were unable to believe</span> (see other illustrations of the usage, <a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>; <a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>). There was a moral impossibility inherited by them through ages of rebellion and insensibility to Divine grace, and through their misuse of Divine revelation. The issue of it was, "'they could not believe." <span class="cmt_word">Because Isaiah said again</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. in another place</span>; illustrative of this great Messianic oracle and the reception it would meet with from the nation as a whole. In the passage which follows we have a translation which does not directly correspond with either the Hebrew or the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a>. The prophet is bidden by the Lord to punish the people for their obduracy by blinding their eyes and hardening their heart, and even arresting the conversion and healing of the covenant people. This same solemn passage is quoted in four other places in the New Testament. Perhaps <a href="/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a> is hardly to be regarded as a citation; a small portion only of the passage is introduced from the prophet without reference to him, and this is inverted in order. In <a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14, 15</a> there is the nearer approach to the LXX., which, however, transforms the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x5e2;</span>, "to hear, hear ye," into <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "by hearing ye shall hear;" and similarly with the other clauses, - the imperative of God's command to the prophet being resolved into the future of most certain accomplishment, and in place of "Lest they understand with their heart, and convert, and he [God] heal them," LXX. reads, "Lest... should convert, and I [who give you the command to deliver such a message, notwithstanding its results upon them] heal them." This St. Matthew has followed. <a href="/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a> has given a different representation again, and, while omitting a considerable portion of the passage, passes to the climax, which is put thus: "Lest they should be converted, and their sin should be forgiven them," showing that the evangelist, looking to the Hebrew rather than to the LXX., has resolved its meaning into a clearly related paraphrase. In <a href="/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26, 27</a> the passage almost verbally follows the LXX. Here in the remarks of St. John the whole passage seems independent of the LXX., and to have resolved the Hebrew "imperative," addressed to the prophet, into an awful assurance of Divine agency in the matter. Instead of "shut their eyes," Hebrew imperative, or LXX. "their eyes they closed," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX., he says, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">He hath blinded their eyes</span>; and so with the other terms: <span class="cmt_word">He hardened</span> <span class="cmt_word">their heart; in order that they should not</span> (lest they should) <span class="cmt_word">see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and should turn, and I should heal them.</span> In <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> the evangelist, returning to the first person, draws a distinction between the retributive activity of the pre-existent Christ of the earlier revelation and the historical Savior. There is no slip or negligence. Godet and Hengstenberg go a long way in making God the Author of the sin and rejection, and the cause of the impossibility of their repentance and healing. That which in all the several quotations of this passage we learn from Isaiah's oracle is that the unforced and willful rejection of the Divine Word is visited by condign withdrawment of the faculty to receive even more accessible and apprehensible truth. This is the great law of Divine operation in the nature of all moral beings. This law is described as a distinctly foreseen event, and by LXX. as an apprehensible and even conspicuous fact, and it is quoted by St. John as the direct consequence of the Divine activity. He does not mean to say that, because Isaiah foretold this as a Divine reprobation, they, whether they would or not as individuals, were fated to die the death of blindness, but they could not believe, because, on the principle involved in Isaiah's predictions, the Divine government had fulfilled itself, had acted upon its universal law, and in consequence of vows and acts of willful disobedience, they had thus fallen into the curse that belongs to a neglect of the Divine. "They could not believe." Thus even now disinclination to God and to righteousness leads to moral incapacity. Sin is punished by its natural consequences: unbelief is punished by unsusceptibility to clearest evidence; prejudice by blindness; rejection of Divine love by inability to see it at its best. How is this natural evolution brought about? Surely by laws of God. What are these laws but God's ways of acting with all moral agents whatever? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For this reason</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they were unable</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;dynanto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1410.htm">Strong's 1410: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I am powerful, have (the) power, (b) I am able, I can.
