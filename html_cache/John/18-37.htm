The Roman Empire was wary of any claim to kingship that could incite rebellion. Pilate's inquiry is both a legal and political one, as he seeks to determine if Jesus poses a threat to Roman authority. The title "king" is significant, as it connects to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, where a ruler from the line of David is foretold.<p><b>&#8220;You say that I am a king,&#8221; Jesus answered.</b><br>Jesus' response is both an affirmation and a subtle redirection. He acknowledges Pilate's words but implies that His kingship is not of this world, as He later clarifies in <a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>. This statement aligns with the spiritual nature of His kingdom, which is not based on earthly power or political structures. It also fulfills prophecies like <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of a humble king.<p><b>&#8220;For this reason I was born and have come into the world,</b><br>Here, Jesus reveals His divine mission and purpose. His birth and coming into the world are central to the incarnation, as described in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. This phrase underscores the pre-existence of Christ and His intentional entry into human history to fulfill God's redemptive plan, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>.<p><b>to testify to the truth.</b><br>Jesus' mission is to bear witness to the truth, which is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John. Truth, in this context, refers to the ultimate reality of God's kingdom and His redemptive work through Christ. This aligns with <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself as "the way, the truth, and the life." His testimony challenges the falsehoods of the world and calls people to a higher understanding of God's will.<p><b>Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to My voice.&#8221;</b><br>This statement distinguishes those who are aligned with God's truth from those who are not. It echoes <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>, where Jesus describes His followers as sheep who hear His voice. Belonging to the truth implies a relationship with Christ and a commitment to His teachings. It also highlights the spiritual discernment given to believers, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

There is a strong emphasis, and it may be sarcasm, expressed in the pronoun, "Does it not follow then that <span class= "ital">Thou</span> art a king?"<p><span class= "bld">Thou sayest that I am a king.</span>--Or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">Thou sayest; for I am a king.</span> (Comp. <a href="/matthew/26-25.htm" title="Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said to him, You have said.">Matthew 26:25</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Unto this end have I been born, and unto this end am I come unto the world.</span> Our translators have rendered the same Greek words by different English words--"To this end," "for this cause," intending probably that the first phrase should be understood of the words which precede, and the second of those which follow: "To this end (that I may be a king) was I born, and for this (that I may bear witness unto the truth) came I into the world." Had this been the meaning, it would have been almost certainly expressed by the usual distinction in Greek; and in the absence of any such distinction, the natural interpretation is, "To be king have I been born, and to be a king came I into the world, in order that I may bear witness unto the truth." The birth and the entrance into the world both refer to the Incarnation, but make emphatic the thought that the birth in time of Him who existed with the Father before all time, was the manifestation in the world of Him who came forth from the Father. This thought of "coming into the world" is frequent in St. John. (Comp. especially <a href="/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>; <a href="/john/16-28.htm" title="I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.">John 16:28</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That I should bear witness unto the truth.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-8.htm" title="He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.">John 1:8</a>. He has indeed a kingdom, and He came into the world to be a king; but His rule is that of the majesty of Truth, and His kingdom is to be established by His witness of the eternal truth which He had known with His Father, and which He alone could declare to man. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>; <a href="/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>.) He came to be a witness--a martyr--to the truth, and to send forth others to be witnesses and martyrs to the same truth, through the Holy Spirit, who should guide them into all truth. Such was His kingdom; such the power by which it was to rule. It was not of this world: it possessed neither land nor treasury, neither senate nor legions, neither consuls nor procurators; but it was to extend its sceptre over all the kingdoms of the earth. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pilate therefore said to him, Art thou a King then</span>? The precise mean-lug of this exclamation depends on the accentuation of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span> - whether it be <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> equivalent to <span class="accented">igitur</span>, "therefore:" "Therefore on your own showing you are a King!" or whether <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span> be the form; then it would have the force of <span class="accented">nonne igitur?</span> expecting an affirmative response. It is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament, but it generally implies an inference and a question expecting agreement with the questioner. Here Pilate flashes out with haughty rebuke. He had satisfied himself that Jesus was no political rival; hut, in wonderment and scorn, he would sound a little deeper the mystery of the kingly claim. It is not a judicial inquiry, but a burst of ironical surprise: <span class="accented">So then</span>, <span class="accented">after all</span>, <span class="accented">thou art a King</span>, <span class="accented">even then?</span> wavering between positive and negative reply. Hengstenberg sees neither irony nor scorn in the <span class="accented">obsess</span>, but a certain amount of disturbed equanimity. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, Thou sayest it, that I am a King.</span> This mode of affirmation is not found in classical Greek or the LXX., but occurs in the New Testament, and in the synoptists also it is given as the great answer of Jesus. Some have translated the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as "for" or "because," and added "well" and "rightly" to the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus: <span class="accented">Thou sayest well</span>, <span class="accented">for I am a King</span>. Hengstenberg and Lampe separate this declaration from what follows, which they interpret exclusively of the prophetic office of Jesus: but the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> points backwards as well as forwards, and our Lord accepts that which he proceeds to explain as his royal functions. Westcott, however, says that Jesus neither accepts nor rejects the title of King, but simply reiterates Pilate's words, "Thou sayest that I am a King; I will proceed to explain what I mean by my royal mission." Seeing, however, that our Lord had already implicitly avowed his kingly state, it is far better to discern in the reply an acknowledgment of the inference which Pilate had scornfully drawn (see parallel method of answering the question, "Art thou the Son of God?" <a href="/luke/22-70.htm">Luke 22:70</a>, "Ye say that I am;" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> compared with <a href="/mark/14-62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>). This is the "good confession" to which St. Paul referred (<a href="/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>). This is the assumption, before the tribunal of the whole world, that he was and would forever remain its true King. <span class="cmt_word">To this end have I been born</span>. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is an important admission of his true humanity, which Keim and others are unwilling to find in the Fourth Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">And to this end have I come into the world.</span> These words are not tautological. In the first clause he asserts his birth as a man, in the second he refers to the state of being which preceded his incarnation (cf. here <a href="/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>, note), out of which he came, and to which he is now returning. The being "born" of woman is one fact, the "coming into this world" is another which he makes antithetical to his return to the Father. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, present perfect, being used instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and implies that his "coming is permanent in its effects, and not simply a past historic fact" (Westcott). <span class="cmt_word">In order that I might bear witness unto the truth.</span> This is his supreme claim. There is an absolute reality. God's way of thinking about things is the closest approximation we can make to the concept of "truth <span class="accented">per se</span>." In this is comprehended all the reality of the Divine nature and character; all that the eternal God thinks concerning man and the laws which have been given him, and concerning the failure of man to realize God's idea of what he ought to have been; all the absolute fact, just as it really is, of man's peril and his prospects, the actual relations between body and spirit, between the individual and the community; all man's positive need of redemption; all the deep mystery of Christ's own Person and work. These constitute the mighty realm of things, beings, duties, and prospects, which we call truth. Jesus said he had been born and had come into the world in order to bear witness to truth. From John the Baptist's standpoint, that prophet bore witness concerning the <span class="accented">light</span> (<a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 8</a>), and, according to the range of his vision, he too (<a href="/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>) bore "witness to the truth" (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. so far as he knew it) of the Christ. Our Lord now solemnly declares that he himself came to bear witness to THE TRUTH in all its amplitude. Hengstenberg sees in these words simply a reference here to the <span class="accented">prophetic</span> office of Christ; but the next clause shows that our Lord is actually defining by this claim the extent of the <span class="accented">kingdom</span> that is "not from hence" or from this world as its origin. <span class="cmt_word">Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice</span>. To "hear the voice" is to obey as a supreme authority (<a href="/john/10-8.htm">John 10:8, 16, 27</a>), and the phrase shows how widely the thought ranges. Every mind open to the influence of truth, every one who is set against the unrealities of mere opinion or tradition, who derives life and joy from the realm of reality, every one who therefore knows how different he might be, how much he needs, who is "of God," as the Source and Beginning and Ground of all things. Compare here the remarkable parallel to this sentiment, John rift. 47; and also the words of the high-priestly prayer, "All thine are mine, and mine are thine," and "Those whom thou hast given me are thine; thine they were, and thou gavest them me." The same large embrace of human souls is conspicuous here, <span class="accented">Every one that is of the truth</span> heareth the voice of Christ, and will accept his authority as final and supreme. The sublime witness to the truth which he had been bearing, in this manifestation of the Name of the Father, would make the voice of Jesus the imperial and august authority for all who fell how much they needed truth. The Sanhedrists said that "truth is the seal of God," and they played upon the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span> or "truth," by making it equivalent to the first and middle and last of all things, seeing that <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x20;&#x5d0;</span>, are the first, middle, and last of the letters of the alphabet <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#954;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Oukoun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3766.htm">Strong's 3766: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, so then.
