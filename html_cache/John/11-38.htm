The Greek word used here, "embrimaomai," suggests a deep, almost indignant emotion. This reflects Jesus' compassion and empathy for human suffering and the effects of sin and death. It also shows His divine nature, as He is moved by the pain of those He loves, paralleling His earlier weeping in <a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>. This emotional response can be seen as a fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief."<p><b>came to the tomb</b><br>The tomb was a common burial place in first-century Judea, often carved out of rock. This setting is significant as it foreshadows Jesus' own burial and resurrection. The act of coming to the tomb demonstrates Jesus' willingness to confront death directly, a precursor to His ultimate victory over it. This moment is a pivotal point in the narrative, setting the stage for the miracle of raising Lazarus, which serves as a sign of Jesus' power over death and a foretaste of His own resurrection.<p><b>It was a cave</b><br>Caves were frequently used as tombs in ancient Israel due to the rocky terrain. This detail aligns with archaeological findings in the region, where many such burial sites have been discovered. The use of a cave as a tomb is also reminiscent of the burial of the patriarchs, such as Abraham, who was buried in the cave of Machpelah (<a href="/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a>). This connection underscores the continuity of God's plan throughout biblical history.<p><b>with a stone laid across the entrance</b><br>The stone signifies the finality and permanence of death, as it was used to seal the tomb and prevent tampering or the spread of decay. This imagery is later mirrored in the account of Jesus' own burial, where a stone is rolled away to reveal the empty tomb (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>). The stone also serves as a physical barrier that Jesus will overcome, symbolizing His power to remove the obstacles of sin and death. This act of moving the stone is a powerful testament to His authority and foreshadows the resurrection, where the stone is rolled away, signifying the defeat of death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who demonstrates His divine authority and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>The deceased brother of Mary and Martha, whose resurrection is the focal miracle of this chapter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_and_martha.htm">Mary and Martha</a></b><br>Sisters of Lazarus, who are mourning his death and are witnesses to Jesus' power and compassion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>A cave with a stone laid across the entrance, typical of burial practices in ancient Judea.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Onlookers who have come to mourn with Mary and Martha and witness the miracle Jesus is about to perform.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_compassion_and_humanity.htm">Jesus' Compassion and Humanity</a></b><br>Jesus' deep emotional response shows His empathy and connection to human suffering.
