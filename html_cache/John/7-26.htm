Despite previous threats against Him, He speaks openly in the temple courts. This boldness contrasts with the secrecy His brothers suggested earlier (<a href="/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3-4</a>). His public teaching fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah being a teacher and a prophet (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>). The act of speaking publicly also demonstrates His authority and fearlessness, characteristics of the Messiah.<p><b>and they are not saying anything to Him.</b><br>The Jewish leaders, who previously sought to kill Jesus (<a href="/john/7.htm">John 7:1</a>), are now silent. This silence could indicate their confusion or fear of the crowd, who were divided in their opinions about Jesus (<a href="/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12-13</a>). The leaders' inaction may also reflect a divine restraint, allowing Jesus to fulfill His mission. This moment highlights the tension between Jesus' growing influence and the leaders' inability to counteract it effectively.<p><b>Have the rulers truly recognized that this is the Christ?</b><br>This question reflects the crowd's speculation about the leaders' motives. The term "Christ" refers to the Messiah, the anointed one prophesied in the Hebrew Scriptures. The crowd wonders if the leaders' silence means they acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah. This question underscores the messianic expectations of the time and the leaders' struggle to reconcile Jesus' actions and teachings with their understanding of the Messiah. The rulers' eventual rejection of Jesus (<a href="/john/7-48.htm">John 7:48</a>) fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah being despised and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, speaking publicly in the temple courts during the Feast of Tabernacles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_authorities.htm">Jewish Authorities</a></b><br>Religious leaders who are questioning Jesus' identity and authority, yet are not arresting Him despite His public teaching.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people present at the temple, witnessing Jesus' teachings and the authorities' inaction, leading to their speculation about His identity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, specifically in the temple courts, a significant location for Jewish worship and teaching.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A major Jewish festival during which this event occurs, drawing many people to Jerusalem and providing a backdrop for Jesus' public ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/public_proclamation_of_faith.htm">Public Proclamation of Faith</a></b><br>Jesus' example of speaking publicly about His identity encourages believers to boldly proclaim their faith, even in the face of opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_christ.htm">Authority of Christ</a></b><br>The passage challenges us to recognize and submit to the authority of Christ, as the crowd speculates whether the authorities have done.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_man_vs._fear_of_god.htm">Fear of Man vs. Fear of God</a></b><br>The authorities' inaction may stem from fear of the crowd or political repercussions, reminding us to prioritize God's approval over human opinion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_belief.htm">Discernment in Belief</a></b><br>The crowd's question about Jesus' identity calls us to discern truth from speculation and to seek understanding through Scripture and prayer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_witnessing.htm">Courage in Witnessing</a></b><br>Like Jesus, we are called to be courageous in our witness, trusting that God will use our testimony for His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_7_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 7:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_7_26_Jesus_authority_as_Messiah.htm">How does John 7:26 reveal Jesus' authority and identity as the Messiah?
