The "last and greatest day" is the climax of the feast, known as Hoshana Rabbah. During this time, water-drawing ceremonies were performed, symbolizing prayers for rain and spiritual refreshment. This context highlights the importance of Jesus' proclamation, as water was a central theme of the festival.<p><b>Jesus stood up and called out in a loud voice</b><br>In the context of Jewish teaching, rabbis typically sat while teaching.

This act of standing and calling out breaks with traditional teaching methods, underscoring the authority and urgency of His message.<p><b>If anyone is thirsty</b><br>Thirst here symbolizes spiritual longing and need. In the arid climate of Israel, physical thirst was a common experience, making it a powerful metaphor for spiritual desire.

With this agree the words in <a href="/context/leviticus/23-35.htm" title="On the first day shall be an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:35-36</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-39.htm" title="Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.">Leviticus 23:39</a>, and <a href="/nehemiah/8-18.htm" title="Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God.

Later the eight days of the festival are certainly spoken of as in the Talmud, in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/10-6.htm" title="And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held the feast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains and dens like beasts.">2 Maccabees 10:6</a>, and Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. iii.</span> 10, ? 4. The best modern authorities are for the most part agreed that it was the eighth day, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the 22nd of Tishri, that is here referred to. It was the "great day" as the octave of the feast, and the day of holy convocation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 37-39.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <span class="accented">The claim to be Organ and Giver of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now on the last day, the great day of the feast.</span> A question arises - Was the last day the seventh or the eighth day? and why was it called the great day? The question cannot be finally answered. The Feast of Tabernacles, according to <a href="/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>, is said to last seven days; and, so far as the Mosaic ceremonial goes, the ceremonial of the seventh day was less imposing and festive than either of the preceding days. But <a href="/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a> shows that the eighth day was also celebrated as a solemn assembly, on which no servile work could be done (cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-18.htm">Nehemiah 8:18</a>). In 2 Macc. 10:6 eight days of the feast were spoken cf. On the day of holy convocation the people removed or left their booths, and thus commemorated, with great rejoicing, the close of the wilderness period and the commencement of their national history. It may, moreover, have been called "the great day" because it was the closing day of all the festivals of the year. Josephus calls it "the very sacred close (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the year." The LXX. gives the curious translation <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, for <span class="accented">azereth</span>, equivalent to "assembly." This <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> Philo ('De Septenaris') describes as the end of the festivals of the sacred year. Meyer, Alford, Godet, Lange, and many others regard the eighth day as that here referred to by the word "great," and find, in the very absence of the ceremonial of drawing water from the Pool of Siloam, the occasion which provoked the reference of our Lord to his own power to meet the spiritual thirst of mankind, thus repeating what he had said to the woman of Samaria of his own grace, with further and nobler expansions. The songs which had been sung on every previous day of the feast were sung without the special rejoicings and water ceremonial. Hence some have thought that the very contrast between the previous days and this last day, "great" in other respects, may have made the reference quite as impressive as if the following words had been spoken in some pause, or at the conclusion of the great Hallel of the seventh day. So Westcott. It should, however, be noted that Rabbi Juda (in the Genesisara on 'Succah') asserts that the water pouring took place on the eighth day as well. This is supposed, by Lange, to be inaccurate or a later addition. Edersheim, however, has given strong reasons for believing that very special ceremonial took place on the <span class="accented">seventh</span> day. The people, all carrying in both hands their palm, myrtle, and citron branches, divided into three companies, one of which waited in the temple, one went to Moya to fetch willow branches to adorn the altar, and a third repaired with music to the Pool of Siloam, where the priest filled his golden goblet with water, and returned, with blast of trumpet, by the water gate, to the court of the priests. There he was joined by other priests with vessels of wine. The water was poured into the silver funnel, and at this act burst forth the great Hallel (<a href="/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>) in responsive chorus. The people shook their palm branches as they sang the words, "Oh, give thanks unto the Lord." On the last day, the great day of the feast, the priests compassed the altar seven times before the sacrifices were kindled, and the songs accompanying the ceremony of this day were called "the great Hosanna." As the people left the temple they shook off their willow leaves on the altar, and beat their palm branches to pieces. Edersheim thinks that it was at the moment when the pause after the great Hallel occurred that Jesus lifted up his voice, and there is much probability in the suggestion. Alford, accepting the <span class="accented">non</span>-pouring of the water on the eighth day, considers that the very absence of that ceremonial provided the opportunity for the great utterance which follows. Chrysostom says, on the eighth day, "when they were returning home, he g - adopting an unusual attitude of command, and unaccustomed energy of voice (<a href="/john/1-35.htm">John 1:35</a> and ver. 28, note) ? <span class="cmt_word">If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</span> Christ thus identifies himself with the deepest meaning of the Old Testament and the Hebrew ritual. The sabbath and the temple found the highest expression of their meaning in his life and work. Godet thinks that the underlying reference here was to that of which the ceremonial was a memorial, and pointed to the smiting of the rock in the wilderness, from whose hidden depths the rushing waters flowed. The cry, "If any man thirst," might certainly recall the terrible drought in the wilderness, though there does not seem to me any definite reference to it in what follows. The libation of water was certainly not offered to the multitudes to drink, but the ritual use of water treats it as an dement absolutely essential to our human life. The people gave thanks that they had reached a land where fell the early and latter rain, and fountains and wells and springs of living water ran. Christ offered more than all - the utter final quenching of all torturing thirst. The people sang <a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>, "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." He said, "Come to me," and your joy shall be full. To the woman at the well he had said that the water he would give should be in the soul as a well of water springing up into eternal life. but in this connection he promised a much more precious gift. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">On</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
