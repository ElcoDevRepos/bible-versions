It is traditionally associated with the patriarch Jacob, who is said to have dug the well. This location holds deep historical and religious significance for both Jews and Samaritans, as it connects to the patriarchal narratives found in Genesis. The well symbolizes God's provision and faithfulness to His people. It is a tangible link to the past, reminding the people of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The well's presence in this narrative sets the stage for Jesus' interaction with the Samaritan woman, highlighting the continuity of God's work from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>Jesus, weary from His journey</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the humanity of Jesus, who, though fully divine, experienced physical limitations and fatigue. His weariness underscores the reality of the Incarnation, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). It also reflects the humility of Christ, who willingly subjected Himself to human experiences and limitations. This moment of weariness serves as a reminder of Jesus' empathy and understanding of human struggles, as He experienced them firsthand. It also foreshadows His ultimate sacrifice, where He would endure suffering and exhaustion on the cross for the salvation of humanity.<p><b>sat down by the well</b><br>Jesus sitting by the well is a deliberate act that sets the stage for His encounter with the Samaritan woman. In the cultural context of the time, wells were common gathering places, especially for women who came to draw water. By sitting at the well, Jesus positions Himself in a place where He can engage with the local community, breaking social norms and barriers. This act demonstrates His intentional outreach to those marginalized by society, such as the Samaritans, who were often despised by the Jews. It also symbolizes Jesus as the source of living water, offering spiritual refreshment and eternal life to all who come to Him.<p><b>It was about the sixth hour</b><br>The sixth hour, according to Jewish timekeeping, corresponds to around noon. This detail is significant because it was unusual for women to draw water at this time due to the heat of the day. The Samaritan woman's presence at the well during this hour suggests she may have been avoiding the other women of the town, possibly due to her social status or personal circumstances. This timing highlights the divine appointment of Jesus' encounter with her, as He reaches out to someone who is isolated and in need of His message of grace and truth. The sixth hour also connects to other significant events in the Gospel of John, such as the crucifixion, where Jesus' sacrifice brings about the ultimate fulfillment of His mission to offer living water to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is both fully divine and fully human.

Jesus, passing from south to west would pass up the valley of <span class= "ital">Mochna</span> until the road turns sharp to the west, to enter the valley of Sichem between Ebal and Gerizim. Here is Jacob's field, and in the field is Jacob's well. It is dug in the rock, and is about 9 feet in diameter. The older travellers described it as more than 100 feet deep, and with several feet of water. Modern travellers have generally found it dry. Wilson describes it, in 1843, as only 75 feet deep.<p><span class= "bld">Sat thus on the well.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">was sitting thus at the well.</span> The words are one of the instances of exact knowledge which meet us in this Gospel. The tense is the descriptive imperfect. He was thus sitting when the woman came. He thus recalls the picture as it was impressed and remained fixed in the writer's mind. He saw Him, wearied by the noontide journey, sitting thus by the well, while they went on to the city to procure food. The reality of this fatigue, as one of the instances witnessing to the reality of His human nature, is important.<p><span class= "bld">About the sixth hour</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as elsewhere in St. John, following the ordinary mode of counting, about 12 o'clock. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-39.htm" title="He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelled, and stayed with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.">John 1:39</a>.) It is contended, on the other hand, that this was not the usual time for women to resort to the wells to draw water, but the narrative perhaps implies an unusual hour, as it speaks of only one woman there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Jacob's well was</span> <span class="cmt_word">there;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">now there was a spring there, Jacob's.</span> The word generally translated "well" is <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>, the representative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">puteus</span>; but <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>, the word here used, corresponds with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">fons.</span> In vers. 11, 12 the word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> is used of the same place. To the present day this indubitable site goes by both names. This district abounds in springs (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>), and the digging of this deep well was a work of supererogation, such as might be performed by a stranger in the land. The well is indeed fed by fountains of water in the neighbourhood. It has been known as Jacob's well by a continuous tradition, and is situated in the plain of Mukhhan, under the rough sides of Gerizim, just beyond the spot where the plain is entered almost at right angles by the eastern end of the vale of Shechem. The latter vale is constituted by the two mountain ridges of Gerizim on the south and Ebal on the north. Nablous, or Shechem, is not visible from the well of Sychar, being hidden by the spur of Gerizim from view, and higher up the valley of Shechem are the present ruins of Sebastich or Samaria proper. Dean Stanley said it was one of the most beautiful spots in Palestine. Sychar lies half a mile to the north of the traditional well. The well, two hundred years ago, was declared by Maundrell to be a hundred and five feet deep, and built of solid masonry. In 1866 Lieutenant Anderson found it seventy-five feet deep, and quite dry. It is nine or ten feet in diameter; and it is one of the most indubitable spots where we may feel certain that the feet of the blessed Lord have trod. Efforts are now being made by the Palestine Exploration Society to protect and restore the well. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore, being wearied</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> is "to labour unto weariness," from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, exhausting toil) <span class="cmt_word">with his journey.</span> A long, exhausting march told upon him, and he felt the weakness of our humanity. Thoma suggests that, because the woman that Jacob found at the well was Rachel, the mother of Joseph, the Samaritans' special patriarch, and because Leah was the mother of Levi and Judah, and her name means "wearied," so Jesus is represented as weary with his journey unto the home of Rachel! It is far more important to notice that the author of this Gospel, whose main idea was that Jesus is "the only begotten Son of the Father," "the Word made flesh," yet impresses upon us continually his realization of the full humanity, the definite, concrete human existence of Jesus. His life was no phantasm of the imagination, no mere docetic manifestation, as the Tubingen school attribute to the Johannine Christ, but veritable man. This Gospel alone records his presence and miracle at Cana, his travel-worn sympathy with our weakness, his making clay with spittle, his weeping over the grave of a friend, his thirst upon the cross, the blood that issued from his wounded side, and the obvious physical reality of his risen body, and thus furnishes the Church with the grounds on which the apostle maintained his Divine humanity. <span class="accented">Jesus <span class="cmt_word"></span>was seated thus</span> - or, <span class="accented">sat thus</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wearied, exhausted - <span class="cmt_word">on the well;</span> or on the low parapet of the well, which protected its mouth, he sat there comparatively, if not quite, alone. The position of the word "thus" after "sat" would, in classic Greek, make the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> mean "simply, without other preoccupation;" but there is no logical reason to deprive the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of its full meaning (Hengstenberg). The Lord, taking his seat by this memorable spot, rich in varied associations, becomes at once a type of the richer and diviner supply of life which he is able and ready to dispense to mankind. The weariness and waiting of the Lord at the well was a sublime hint of the exhaustless supply of grace which was ever flowing from the broken heart of the Son of God. <span class="cmt_word">It was</span> <span class="cmt_word">about the sixth hour</span>. The author is remarkable for his repeated mention of the hours at which some of the most memorable crises of his life took place, and thus gives a vivid impression of reality and of the presence of the eyewitness. He must himself have waited by the side of the Lord, and overheard the conversation which followed, just as he did the conversation with Nicodemus. Great difference of opinion prevails as to his method of computing time; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether he adopted the Jewish computation, from sunrise to sunset into twelve variable hours, or the Roman method of computation, from midnight to midday, from noon to midnight, into twelve hours of equal length. Some difficulties are reduced by the latter hypothesis (see M'Clellan and Westcott, 'Additional Notes to <a href="/john/19.htm">John 19</a>;' Edersheim, <span class="accented">l.c.</span>, 1:405; Moulton, <span class="accented">in loco</span>; Townson, 'Discourses of the Four Gospels,' p. 215). The hour referred to would then be <span class="accented">about</span> six o'clock in the evening, the very time when purchases would be made, and when women are in the habit of drawing water. The difficulty that presents itself is the brevity of the time remaining for all that happens as described in vers. 27-38, broad daylight being almost presupposed in ver. 35. Still, if "about the sixth hour" was five o'clock, even in January there would be possible time for the conversation, for the return of the disciples, and also for the approach of the Samaritans; though it must be remembered that twilight in Palestine is very brief, and that the whole narrative suggests the idea of leisure rather than hurried converse. If the Roman method of interpretation were adopted, the sixth hour <span class="accented">might</span> mean six o'clock in the morning, which was the hour intended, if the Roman computation <span class="accented">must</span> be supposed in <a href="/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a>. This suggestion has further difficulties. The weariness of the Lord at that early hour would imply a long journey before daybreak, which is extremely improbable (see <a href="/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9</a>). Besides, though Townson and M'Clellan lay emphasis on this Roman computation of time in Asia Minor, and advance some proof of it, yet some of their authorities are far from proving it. Luthardt says we have no right to suppose that John would deviate from the current Jewish computation. "About the sixth hour" would therefore mean "about noon," the very time when it is so common to rest after a morning journey. Lucke, Meyer, Hengstenberg, Godet, Lange, Schaff, Geikie, Watkins, all press the same interpretation of the words. Lucke justly says that there is no hint of the Lord and his disciples intending to remain by the well, but to pursue their journey after rest and food. This is inconsistent with the idea of an evening halt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Since</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jacob&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#945;&#954;&#974;&#946;</span> <span class="translit">(Iak&#333;b)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2384.htm">Strong's 2384: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jacob, the progenitor of the Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">well</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#951;&#947;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#275;g&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4077.htm">Strong's 4077: </a> </span><span class="str2">A fountain, spring, well, issue, flow.
