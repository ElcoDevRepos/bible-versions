It suggests a chronological progression in Jesus' ministry. The "after this" refers to the period following the miraculous feeding of the 5,000 and Jesus' teachings on being the Bread of Life, which caused many disciples to turn away.<p><b>Jesus traveled throughout Galilee</b><br>Galilee was a region in northern Israel, known for its fertile land and diverse population. It was less politically charged than Judea, making it a strategic location for Jesus to continue His ministry. Galilee was also the home region of many of Jesus' disciples, providing a supportive environment for His teachings and miracles. This area was prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a> as a place where a great light would shine, fulfilled in Jesus' ministry.<p><b>He did not want to travel in Judea</b><br>Judea, in contrast to Galilee, was the center of Jewish religious and political life, with Jerusalem as its capital. Jesus' decision to avoid Judea at this time reflects His awareness of the growing hostility from the religious leaders. This choice demonstrates His wisdom in timing and strategy, as He often withdrew from potential danger until the appointed time for His crucifixion.<p><b>because the Jews there were trying to kill Him</b><br>The term "the Jews" in this context refers specifically to the Jewish religious leaders and authorities who opposed Jesus. Their hostility stemmed from His claims of divinity, His challenge to their authority, and His growing influence among the people. This animosity had been building since Jesus healed on the Sabbath and claimed equality with God (<a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>). The plot to kill Jesus was a fulfillment of the prophetic suffering servant described in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, highlighting the increasing tension leading to His eventual crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is traveling and ministering during His earthly ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>A region in northern Israel where Jesus conducted much of His ministry.
