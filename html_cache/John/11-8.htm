This title reflects the Jewish tradition of discipleship, where students would follow a rabbi to learn from his teachings and way of life. In the Gospels, Jesus is often addressed as "Rabbi" by His followers, highlighting His role as a teacher of divine truth.<p><b>"the Jews just tried to stone You"</b><br>This phrase refers to a previous incident where Jewish leaders attempted to stone Jesus for what they perceived as blasphemy, particularly in <a href="/john/10-31.htm">John 10:31-33</a>, where Jesus claimed unity with the Father. Stoning was a prescribed punishment for blasphemy under Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). The hostility of the Jewish leaders towards Jesus is a recurring theme in the Gospels, as they often opposed His teachings and miracles, which challenged their authority and interpretation of the Law.<p><b>"and You are going back there?"</b><br>The disciples express concern and disbelief at Jesus' intention to return to Judea, where His life was previously threatened. This reflects their fear for His safety and possibly their own, as well as a lack of understanding of Jesus' mission and divine purpose. Jesus' decision to return demonstrates His courage and commitment to fulfilling His Father's will, regardless of personal danger.

<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture highlights their collective voice (&#8220;they&#8221;), reminding us that following Christ is often worked out in community (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>).<p>&#8226;
