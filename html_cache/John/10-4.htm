In biblical times, shepherds would gather their sheep into a communal pen at night for protection. In the morning, each shepherd would call his sheep, and they would follow him out. This imagery highlights the personal relationship between the shepherd and his sheep, symbolizing Jesus' relationship with His followers. The phrase emphasizes the idea of ownership and care, as the shepherd knows each sheep individually. This reflects the intimate knowledge and care Jesus has for His followers, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd who leads and provides for His sheep.<p><b>he goes on ahead of them</b><br>The shepherd leading from the front is significant, as it demonstrates guidance and protection. In the ancient Near East, shepherds would lead their flocks to ensure they were safe from predators and to find good pasture. This leadership style contrasts with modern methods where sheep are often driven from behind. Jesus, as the Good Shepherd, leads by example, going before His followers and preparing the way. This is reminiscent of God leading the Israelites through the wilderness in a pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). It underscores the trustworthiness and reliability of Jesus as a leader who does not abandon His flock.<p><b>and his sheep follow him</b><br>The sheep's response to the shepherd's leadership is one of trust and obedience. This reflects the expected response of believers to Jesus' call. In the cultural context, sheep are known for their ability to recognize their shepherd's voice and follow him, even amidst other flocks. This obedience is not out of compulsion but a natural response to the shepherd's care and guidance. The imagery here is a call to discipleship, where followers of Christ are expected to heed His teachings and follow His example, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>, where Jesus calls His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him.<p><b>because they know his voice</b><br>The recognition of the shepherd's voice signifies a deep, personal relationship. In the biblical context, knowing the voice implies familiarity and trust. Sheep would not follow a stranger because they do not recognize his voice, highlighting the unique bond between the shepherd and his sheep. This is a metaphor for the spiritual discernment believers have, enabling them to distinguish the voice of Christ from false teachings. It echoes the promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>, where God speaks of a new covenant where His people will know Him personally. This phrase emphasizes the importance of a personal relationship with Jesus, cultivated through prayer, study of Scripture, and obedience to His commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Good Shepherd who leads His sheep, representing His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolic of believers who recognize and follow the voice of Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd.htm">Shepherd</a></b><br>A metaphor for Jesus, emphasizing His role as a leader and protector.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fold.htm">The Fold</a></b><br>Represents the community of believers or the Church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice.htm">The Voice</a></b><br>The teachings and guidance of Jesus, which His followers recognize and trust.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_the_shepherd's_voice.htm">Recognizing the Shepherd's Voice</a></b><br>Believers are called to discern and follow the voice of Jesus amidst the noise of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/following_with_trust.htm">Following with Trust</a></b><br>Just as sheep trust their shepherd, Christians are encouraged to trust Jesus' guidance in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_of_believers.htm">Community of Believers</a></b><br>The imagery of the fold reminds us of the importance of being part of a community that follows Christ together.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_guidance.htm">Leadership and Guidance</a></b><br>Jesus exemplifies perfect leadership, and believers are to model their leadership after His example.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>Developing the ability to distinguish Jesus' voice from false teachings is crucial for spiritual growth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_10_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 10:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Recognizing_Jesus_voice_in_John_10_4.htm">How can we recognize Jesus' voice as described in John 10:4?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_follow_Jesus_daily_3.htm">What steps can we take to follow Jesus' guidance daily?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_10_4_to_Psalm_23_s_shepherd.htm">How does John 10:4 connect to Psalm 23's depiction of the shepherd?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_distinguish_Jesus_voice.htm">Why is it important to distinguish Jesus' voice from others?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_10_4_s_guidance_in_confusion.htm">How can John 10:4 encourage us in times of spiritual confusion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_10_4_Jesus_bond_with_followers.htm">How does John 10:4 illustrate the relationship between Jesus and His followers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_10_4_on_spiritual_leadership.htm">What does John 10:4 reveal about the nature of spiritual leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Imagery_in_John_10_4_and_divine_guidance.htm">How does the imagery in John 10:4 relate to the concept of divine guidance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_are_the_other_sheep.htm">Who are the other sheep not of this fold?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'naked_and_not_ashamed'_mean.htm">What does 'My sheep hear My voice' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_hearing_god.htm">What does the Bible say about hearing God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_it_mean_to_be_god's_sheep.htm">What does it mean to be God's sheep?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 10:4 Mean</div><b>When he has brought out all his own</b><p>Jesus pictures Himself as the shepherd who first &#8220;brings out&#8221; the sheep that already belong to Him.

The verse invites us to rest in His ownership, trust His leadership, practice continual obedience, and cultivate ever-growing sensitivity to His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And when he putteth forth his own sheep.</span>--The majority of the better MSS. add the word "all." The tense is past. We should read, therefore, <span class= "ital">when he has put forth all his own sheep.</span> The addition is important as marking the care of the shepherd to count his flock and see that none is missing. The word "put forth" is stronger than "lead out," in the previous verse, and represents the details of the action as it took place in the sheepfold. The shepherd would call each sheep by name, and when it answered to its name would drag it outside the fold. Though it knew its shepherd, it would be unwilling to separate itself from the whole flock. One by one, then, he calls his sheep, and places them outside the fold.<p><span class= "bld">He goeth before them, and the sheep follow him.</span>--This is one of the incidents in the management of an Eastern flock, which strikes all who see it for the first time, and is abundantly illustrated in books of Eastern travel. The details are here given with minute accuracy. When the last sheep has been brought out the shepherd places himself at their head, and the flock together follow him.<p><span class= "bld">For they know his voice.</span>--The word is stronger than the one in <a href="/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3</a>, "and the sheep hear his voice." It expresses the familiar knowledge which the little flock has of the voice of their own shepherd who leads them day by day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In like manner, our Lord continues to describe what every true shepherd of men has done and ever will do: <span class="cmt_word">When he hath put forth all</span> <span class="cmt_word">his own</span>, and not another's, drawn them by the music of his voice, or constrained them by the sweet violence of his love, or even compelled them to go forth from a fold in which they may find security, but not pasture; and when he has marshaled them into obedience and into thankful trust by the strength of his sympathy and knowledge of their need, <span class="cmt_word">he goeth before them.</span> He is their leader and example; he shows them in his own life the kind of provision made for them; he shares with them the perils of the wilderness, and first of all is prepared to grapple with their fierce foes, "He drinks of the brook in the way." The highest meaning, the only complete interpretation, of this passage is found when Christ himself is the Shepherd, who does summon from the old enclosure "all his own," all who have entered into living harmony with himself. <span class="cmt_word">And the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</span> Nothing is here said of "lost sheep" or of "goats;" these are all the "ideal sheep" of the flock, individuals who recognize the voice of the true Leader, and discriminate their own shepherd from all others, whether pretenders to their affections or destroyers of their lives - wolves or butchers, thieves or robbers. Should we persist in interpreting the apologue as it stands, a question arises about the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> that are not the shepherd's" own." Some have answered it by supposing that the latter are the chief of his own flock, who will bring the rest after them. The truth is not obscurely hinted of that election to highest privileges and duties, which does not declare that the rest are not sheep at all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Hotan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3752.htm">Strong's 3752: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, whenever.
