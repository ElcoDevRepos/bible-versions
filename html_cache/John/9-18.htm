Their disbelief is consistent with their general resistance to Jesus' miracles and teachings, as seen throughout the Gospels. This skepticism can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the people would hear but not understand, and see but not perceive.<p><b>that the man had been blind</b><br>The focus on the man's blindness underscores the miraculous nature of the healing. Blindness was a common affliction in ancient times, often seen as a sign of sin or divine judgment (<a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>). The healing of a man born blind was unprecedented and served as a powerful testament to Jesus' divine authority and fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened.<p><b>and had received his sight</b><br>Receiving sight is symbolic of spiritual enlightenment and salvation. In the context of John's Gospel, physical sight often parallels spiritual insight. Jesus' miracles are signs pointing to deeper spiritual truths, emphasizing His role as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). This miracle serves as a type of Jesus' power to bring spiritual sight to those in darkness.<p><b>until they summoned his parents</b><br>The summoning of the man's parents indicates the lengths to which the Jewish leaders would go to verify the miracle. This reflects the legalistic and investigative nature of the Pharisees, who were known for their strict adherence to the law and traditions. The involvement of the parents also highlights the social and familial implications of the miracle, as the parents would have been witnesses to their son's lifelong condition. This act of summoning is reminiscent of the thorough investigations prescribed in the Mosaic Law for verifying claims (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the religious leaders and Pharisees who were skeptical of Jesus' miracles and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was born blind and was healed by Jesus, demonstrating Jesus' divine power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parents_of_the_blind_man.htm">The Parents of the Blind Man</a></b><br>They were summoned by the Jewish leaders to verify their son's condition and the miracle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_healing.htm">The Miracle of Healing</a></b><br>Jesus healed the man born blind, which was a significant sign of His messianic identity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>The place where the religious leaders would have gathered and questioned the parents, representing the center of Jewish religious life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/skepticism_and_unbelief.htm">Skepticism and Unbelief</a></b><br>The religious leaders' refusal to believe the miracle reflects a hardened heart.

<a href="/luke/13-11.htm">Luke 13:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; His blindness set the stage for Jesus to fulfill messianic prophecies: &#8220;Then the eyes of the blind will be opened&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The physical reality of his handicap underscores the literal nature of the miracle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had received his sight</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and had received his sight&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; command, &#8220;Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam,&#8221; resulted in immediate vision (<a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a> affirms, &#8220;The LORD opens the eyes of the blind,&#8221;

By calling the parents, the leaders hoped to discredit the miracle; yet their inquiry only confirmed it (<a href="/john/9-20.htm">John 9:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment reveals how stubborn unbelief seeks additional witnesses not for truth but for grounds to dismiss truth (<a href="/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42-43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-18.htm">John 9:18</a> portrays determined unbelief in the face of undeniable evidence. The leaders doubted the man&#8217;s congenital blindness, the authenticity of his healing, and even summoned his parents&#8212;yet every step only reinforced the miracle. Their hardness contrasts with the man&#8217;s growing faith, highlighting that encountering Jesus demands a heart response. The verse invites readers to move from skepticism to trust, recognizing Jesus as the promised Messiah who literally opens blind eyes&#8212;physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">But the Jews did not believe.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">The Jews therefore did not believe.</span> The words are connected, as an inference, with those which precede. Because of this explanation of the fact, they are driven to the expedient of disbelieving the fact itself. The designation of those who take this position is remarkable.

The angry magistrates who were in the court allowed it to be seen at once that they will not be tampered with, nor lose the chance, if possible, of pursuing their malicious plans already formed against Jesus. They take the ground that no miracle had occurred.
