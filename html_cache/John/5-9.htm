In the context of <a href="/john/5.htm">John 5</a>, Jesus encounters a man who had been an invalid for 38 years. The immediacy of the healing underscores Jesus' divine authority and power over physical ailments, reflecting the creative power of God as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks creation into existence. This miracle also serves as a sign pointing to Jesus as the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the coming age when the lame will leap like a deer.<p><b>and he picked up his mat and began to walk</b><br>The act of picking up his mat and walking signifies the completeness of the healing. The mat, a simple bedroll, symbolizes the man's previous state of helplessness and dependence. By carrying it, the man demonstrates his newfound freedom and ability. This action also serves as a public testimony to the miracle, as others would recognize him as the man who had been incapacitated for decades. The act of walking is a metaphor for the new life and spiritual awakening that comes through faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, where believers are called to walk in the good works prepared for them.<p><b>Now this happened on the Sabbath day</b><br>The timing of the miracle on the Sabbath is significant and sets the stage for the ensuing conflict between Jesus and the Jewish religious leaders. The Sabbath, a day of rest instituted by God in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, was strictly observed by the Jews. However, over time, additional man-made regulations were added, which often overshadowed the original intent of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship. By healing on the Sabbath, Jesus challenges these legalistic interpretations and asserts His authority as Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a>). This act foreshadows the new covenant, where Jesus fulfills the law and offers rest for the soul (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_at_the_pool_of_bethesda.htm">The Man at the Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>A man who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years, waiting for healing at the pool.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who performs the healing miracle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pool_of_bethesda.htm">The Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>A pool in Jerusalem believed to have healing properties when its waters were stirred.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Religious authorities who later question the man and Jesus about the healing on the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_jesus'_word.htm">The Power of Jesus' Word</a></b><br>Jesus' command to the man to "pick up your mat and walk" demonstrates His authority and power to heal instantly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_the_sabbath.htm">The Significance of the Sabbath</a></b><br>The healing on the Sabbath challenges traditional interpretations and highlights Jesus' lordship over the Sabbath.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>The man's immediate response to Jesus' command illustrates the importance of faith and obedience in experiencing God's work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_over_legalism.htm">Compassion Over Legalism</a></b><br>Jesus prioritizes compassion and human need over strict adherence to religious rules, teaching us to do the same.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_and_testimony.htm">Transformation and Testimony</a></b><br>The healed man's new ability to walk serves as a testimony to God's transformative power, encouraging us to share our own accounts of change.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_5_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_5_9_Jesus_Sabbath_authority.htm">How does John 5:9 demonstrate Jesus' authority over the Sabbath?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/John_5_9_Jesus_divine_power.htm">What does the healing in John 5:9 reveal about Jesus' divine power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_healed_man_s_obedience.htm">How can we apply the obedience of the healed man in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Old_Testament_Sabbath_laws_in_John_5_9.htm">What Old Testament laws relate to the Sabbath mentioned in John 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_5_9_inspire_faith_in_Jesus.htm">How does John 5:9 encourage faith in Jesus' ability to transform lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_5_9_Jesus_Sabbath_authority_2.htm">How does John 5:9 demonstrate Jesus' authority over the Sabbath?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_John_5_9_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in John 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_5_9_vs_Jewish_Sabbath_laws.htm">How does John 5:9 challenge traditional Jewish Sabbath laws?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/meaning_of_''no_other_name_under_heaven''.htm">Did Jesus violate the Sabbath law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_belief_make_all_things_possible.htm">Can you rise and carry your bed?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/can_you_rise_and_carry_your_bed.htm">Can you rise and carry your bed?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_miracles_did_jesus_do_in_the_bible.htm">What miracles did Jesus perform according to the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 5:9 Mean</div><b>Immediately the man was made well</b><p>&#8220;Immediately the man was made well&#8221;

(<a href="/mark/5-29.htm">Mark 5:29</a>) and &#8220;Immediately his leprosy was cleansed&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>).<p>&#8226; This underscores Christ&#8217;s complete authority over sickness; His word is sufficient, echoing <a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>, &#8220;For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The man had been incapacitated thirty-eight years (<a href="/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a>). Jesus reverses nearly four decades of weakness in a single moment, reminding us nothing is beyond His reach (<a href="/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The physical healing also points to the spiritual healing offered through Christ, as seen later when Jesus tells him, &#8220;See, you have been made well. Stop sinning&#8230; &#8221; (<a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He picked up his mat and began to walk</b><p>&#8220;and he picked up his mat and began to walk&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-9.htm">John 5:9</a>)<p>&#8226; Immediate action followed immediate healing. Faith is demonstrated not merely by believing Jesus&#8217; words but by acting on them, similar to the paralytic in Capernaum: &#8220;He got up, took his mat, and walked out in full view of them all&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-12.htm">Mark 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Carrying the mat underscores completeness&#8212;no need to return. The mat that once held him captive is now carried by him, reflecting <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>: the old life is gone.<p>&#8226; Walking signifies new freedom and restored dignity. Compare <a href="/acts/3-7.htm">Acts 3:7-8</a>, where the formerly lame man walks and leaps after Peter&#8217;s command in Jesus&#8217; name.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now this happened on the Sabbath day</b><p>&#8220;Now this happened on the Sabbath day&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-9.htm">John 5:9</a>)<p>&#8226; The timing sets up the conflict with religious leaders (<a href="/john/5-10.htm">John 5:10-18</a>). Healing is lawful and compassionate, aligning with <a href="/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a>&#8217;s call to honor the Sabbath by doing good.<p>&#8226; Jesus later clarifies, &#8220;My Father is still working, and I also am working&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>), affirming that God&#8217;s sustaining and saving work never stops, even on the Sabbath.<p>&#8226; Other Sabbath healings&#8212;such as the man with the withered hand (<a href="/luke/6-9.htm">Luke 6:9-10</a>) and the bent-over woman (<a href="/luke/13-16.htm">Luke 13:16</a>)&#8212;highlight the consistent message: mercy fulfills, not violates, the Sabbath intent (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode exposes the danger of valuing rule-keeping over rejoicing in God&#8217;s redemptive work, a warning echoed in <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/5-9.htm">John 5:9</a> reveals Jesus&#8217; sovereign power to restore instantly, calls us to active faith shown by obedient steps, and reminds us that God&#8217;s compassionate work transcends human regulations. The once-paralyzed man stands, walks, and carries evidence of his freedom, all on a day meant for rest&#8212;showing that true Sabbath rest is ultimately found in Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The man was made whole.</span>--The sufferer was known; the healing is in the striking form that none could gainsay.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9a.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">immediately</span> <span class="cmt_word">the man became whole</span> (well, sound in health), <span class="cmt_word">and took up his bed, and walked.</span> This act of obedience was an act of faith, as in every other miracle upon paralyzed nerves and frames. The imagery of the sign explains the <span class="accented">rationale</span> of faith. The impotent man, the paralytic, and the man with withered hand, were severally called by Christ to do that which without Divine aid seemed and was impossible. The spiritual quickening of the mind was communicated to the ordinary physical volition, and the bare act was a method by which the palsied sufferer took hold of God's strength. Faith always lays hold thus of power to do the impossible. The words and the result are similar to those adopted on the cure of the paralytic. This is another instance of the identity of the Christ of John and of the synoptists. The various efforts of Strauss, Baur, and Weiss to identify this miracle with that wrought on the paralytic is, however, in defiance of every condition of time, place, character, and consequences. The energy of faith and love which led the Galilaean sufferer to secure the services of four stalwart friends, not only to carry him, but to make strenuous efforts to bring him into the presence of Jesus, contrasts powerfully with the loneliness and friendlessness of the impotent man; and the method adopted by the Lord to convey his grace, and the discussion that followed on that occasion touching the power of the Son of man to forgive sins, all suggest profoundly different circumstances. Nothing but the claim of the critic to be entirely superior to the document he is interpreting can account for so wild a conjecture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Immediately</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#941;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(euthe&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2112.htm">Strong's 2112: </a> </span><span class="str2">Immediately, soon, at once.
