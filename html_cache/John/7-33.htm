In the context of <a href="/john/7.htm">John 7</a>, Jesus is speaking during the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival. His teachings often challenged the religious leaders, and His words here are part of a larger discourse that reveals His divine mission and identity.<p><b>&#8220;I am with you only a little while longer,</b><br>Jesus is foreshadowing His impending crucifixion and departure from the world. This statement highlights the urgency of His mission and the limited time the people have to accept His message. It reflects the theme of Jesus' earthly ministry being temporary, as seen in other passages like <a href="/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>, where He urges people to walk in the light while they have it.<p><b>and then I am going</b><br>This indicates a transition from His earthly ministry to His return to the Father. It underscores the divine plan and Jesus' obedience to it. The use of "going" suggests a purposeful departure, aligning with His role as the obedient Son fulfilling the Father's will, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>to the One who sent Me.</b><br>This phrase affirms Jesus' divine origin and mission. It connects to the broader Johannine theme of Jesus being sent by the Father, as seen in <a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a> and <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>. It emphasizes His unique relationship with God, His pre-existence, and His return to the Father, fulfilling the prophecies and typologies of the Messiah as the sent one, such as in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the Jewish leaders and the crowd during the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem.

The movement had not escaped him. It is as though he had said, "I see all that will happen. This is my death struggle with those whom I am sent to teach and save.
