Her approach to Jesus here reflects her direct and candid nature. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, women were typically not in positions to speak so directly to men, especially a rabbi, indicating the close relationship and respect Jesus had with this family. This interaction takes place in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, which was a frequent stop for Jesus and His disciples.<p><b>Lord</b><br>By addressing Jesus as "Lord," Martha acknowledges His authority and divinity. This title is significant as it reflects her faith in Jesus' power and position, even amidst her grief. The term "Lord" is used throughout the New Testament to denote respect and recognition of Jesus' divine nature, aligning with Old Testament references to God as Lord.<p><b>if You had been here</b><br>Martha's statement reveals her belief in Jesus' ability to heal the sick, a belief grounded in the many miracles He performed throughout His ministry. This phrase also reflects a common human tendency to question and express regret in times of loss. It highlights the tension between faith and understanding God's timing and purposes.<p><b>my brother would not have died</b><br>This part of the statement underscores Martha's faith in Jesus' healing power, yet it also reveals her limited understanding of His authority over life and death. Lazarus' death sets the stage for one of Jesus' most profound miracles, foreshadowing His own resurrection. This event is a pivotal moment in the Gospel of John, demonstrating Jesus' power over death and His identity as the resurrection and the life, as He later declares in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/martha.htm">Martha</a></b><br>The sister of Mary and Lazarus, known for her practical nature and hospitality.

She comes directly to Jesus, acknowledges His lordship, expresses disappointment in His apparent absence, grieves for her brother, and still believes in His power. The verse invites us to bring our honest hearts to the Lord, trust His timing, and remember that His authority over life and death is absolute and compassionate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span>--We have exactly the same words spoken by Mary in <a href="/john/11-32.htm" title="Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.">John 11:32</a>. They are the utterance of the thought which had already been expressed in their message (<a href="/john/11-3.htm" title="Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.">John 11:3</a>), and had, we may think, been spoken more than once by the sisters to each other. These sisters are among the many who had received our Lord in the fulness of a true faith, of whom the Gospel narrative tells us nothing, or gives us, as here, but a passing glimpse. Their belief is stated in the definiteness of full conviction; but they, like the courtier, connect the power to save with the bodily presence of our Lord. (Comp. <a href="/john/4-49.htm" title="The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.">John 4:49</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Martha therefore (having met her Lord) said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here</span> - the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> expresses no complaint: "If thou hadst been here," a simple condition of what is now an impossible event - <span class="cmt_word">my brother had not died.</span> Meyer says, "If thou weft making thy residence in Bethany rather than in Peraea." This is somewhat unnatural, and would have been a complaint. Her faith had at least ground enough for this assurance, but she mounts above it. The two sisters, with their contrasted natures, had grasped the life-giving, joy-diffusing, heaven-revealing powers of Jesus. They had believed in him, with a gracious abandonment of all prejudice and in the sweeping force of a great illuminating love. They had said often this same thing to one another, and now Martha pours her high persuasion into the ears of her Lord; but she proceeds further. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Martha</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#940;&#961;&#952;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Martha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3136.htm">Strong's 3136: </a> </span><span class="str2">Martha, sister of Mary and Lazarus of Bethany.
