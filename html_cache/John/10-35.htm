This usage highlights the authority and responsibility given to them by God. The term "gods" here is not implying divinity but rather a role of significant authority. This reflects the cultural understanding of the time, where leaders were seen as representatives of divine justice. The use of "gods" underscores the seriousness of their role in executing God's law.<p><b>to whom the word of God came</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that these leaders received their authority through the divine revelation of God's word. The "word of God" here refers to the law and commandments given to Israel, which were meant to guide the leaders in their judgments. This highlights the historical context of Israel as a theocratic society, where civil and religious laws were intertwined. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God communicating His will through chosen individuals, as seen with prophets and leaders throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and the Scripture cannot be broken</b><br>This statement affirms the inerrancy and authority of Scripture. It reflects the belief that God's word is unchangeable and must be fulfilled. This principle is consistent throughout the Bible, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which speaks of God's word accomplishing its purpose. The phrase underscores the reliability of Scripture, a foundational belief in Christian doctrine. It also serves as a reminder of the continuity and consistency of God's revelation from the Old Testament to the New Testament, reinforcing the idea that Jesus' teachings are in harmony with the Scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, addressing the Jewish leaders and defending His claim of being the Son of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, who are challenging His claims and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/scripture.htm">Scripture</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament, which Jesus cites to support His argument.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalm_82.htm">Psalm 82</a></b><br>The Old Testament passage Jesus references, where human judges are called "gods" because they were given authority by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_god.htm">The Word of God</a></b><br>The divine message and revelation given to humanity, which is central to Jesus' argument.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_scripture.htm">The Authority of Scripture</a></b><br>Jesus affirms the unbreakable nature of Scripture, emphasizing its divine authority and reliability.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_authority.htm">Understanding Divine Authority</a></b><br>The term "gods" in <a href="/bsb/psalms/82.htm">Psalm 82</a> highlights the responsibility and authority given to human judges, reminding us of the weight of leadership and accountability before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_divine_identity.htm">Jesus' Divine Identity</a></b><br>By using Scripture to defend His claim, Jesus demonstrates His deep understanding and fulfillment of the Old Testament, affirming His identity as the Son of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>The passage encourages believers to trust in the power and truth of God's Word, which remains unbroken and relevant across time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/engaging_with_scripture.htm">Engaging with Scripture</a></b><br>Believers are called to engage deeply with Scripture, understanding its context and applying its truths to their lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_10_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 10:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_10_35_Scripture_s_authority.htm">How does John 10:35 affirm the authority of Scripture in our lives?

In that psalm the Lord addresses Israel&#8217;s judges, reminding them that they exercise delegated, divine authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a> says, &#8220;I have said, &#8216;You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.&#8217;&#8221; The title &#8220;gods&#8221; is used ironically&#8212;these men sit in God&#8217;s place to render justice, yet they will &#8220;die like men&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/82-7.htm">Psalm 82:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a> shows a similar use: &#8220;See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh.&#8221; Moses isn&#8217;t divine; he simply represents divine authority.<p>&#8226; By citing this verse, Jesus argues from the lesser to the greater: if fallible human judges could be called &#8220;gods&#8221; without blasphemy, how much more can the Father&#8217;s consecrated, incarnate Son bear the title &#8220;Son of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/10-34.htm">John 10:34&#8211;35</a> records Jesus&#8217; exact appeal, anchoring His identity in Scripture rather than human tradition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to whom the word of God came</b><p>The phrase points to the origin of the judges&#8217; authority&#8212;God&#8217;s revealed word.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-6.htm">2 Chronicles 19:6&#8211;7</a> describes Jehoshaphat charging judges to remember that they &#8220;do not judge for man, but for the LORD.&#8221; Their commission was grounded in divine revelation, not personal opinion.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a> reminds us that &#8220;God spoke to our fathers through the prophets,&#8221; underscoring that leadership in Israel was always tied to received revelation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> echoes the principle more broadly: &#8220;There is no authority except that which is from God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By noting that the word &#8220;came&#8221; to these men, Jesus highlights their temporary, derivative status; He, on the other hand, is the eternal Word who &#8220;became flesh&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The contrast elevates Christ far above those earlier recipients.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8212;and the Scripture cannot be broken&#8212;</b><p>With this brief aside Jesus affirms the absolute reliability of every line of God&#8217;s written word.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a> confirms the same truth: &#8220;Not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a> declares, &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed,&#8221; rooting its authority in God&#8217;s own nature.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a> testify that &#8220;the word of our God stands forever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because Scripture cannot be broken, Jesus&#8217; argument is unassailable: if the inspired text assigns the title &#8220;gods&#8221; to mortal judges, the charge of blasphemy against Him collapses. God&#8217;s word sets the ultimate standard, and every accusation must bow to it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a> sits at the heart of Jesus&#8217; defense: Scripture itself once used divine language for human judges, so calling Jesus the Son of God is perfectly legitimate. The verse also provides a ringing endorsement of biblical inerrancy&#8212;&#8220;the Scripture cannot be broken.&#8221; Taken together, these truths affirm Christ&#8217;s deity, expose the weakness of His accusers&#8217; charge, and call every reader to trust without reservation in the unbreakable word of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">If he called them gods.</span>--The argument is another example of Hillel's famous <span class= "ital">First Canon of Interpretation</span>--that the greater may be inferred from the less.
