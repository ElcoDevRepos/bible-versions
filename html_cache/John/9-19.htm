In the context of <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9</a>, the Pharisees are conducting an investigation into the healing of the blind man. This reflects the Jewish leaders' authority and their role in maintaining religious order. The act of questioning is a common theme in the Gospels, where Jesus and His works are frequently scrutinized by religious authorities.<p><b>&#8220;Is this your son,</b><br>The question is directed to the parents of the man born blind. This reflects the importance of family testimony in Jewish culture, where familial relationships were crucial for identity and social standing. The Pharisees are seeking confirmation of the man's identity, which is a critical aspect of establishing the truth in any legal inquiry.<p><b>the one you say was born blind?</b><br>This phrase highlights skepticism and doubt. The Pharisees are questioning the validity of the claim that the man was born blind, which is central to the miracle's significance. In Jewish thought, physical ailments were often associated with sin (<a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>), and a miraculous healing would challenge their understanding of sin and divine intervention. The emphasis on being "born blind" underscores the miraculous nature of the healing, as it was not a temporary or recent affliction.<p><b>So how is it that he can now see?&#8221;</b><br>This question points to the miraculous nature of the healing. The Pharisees are seeking a natural explanation for what is a supernatural event. This reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus' miracles are met with disbelief or attempts to rationalize them. The healing of the blind man is a sign of Jesus' messianic identity, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened. This miracle serves as a type of spiritual enlightenment, where Jesus brings light to those in spiritual darkness (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of John, who performs the miracle of healing the man born blind.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was born blind and is healed by Jesus, becoming a witness to Jesus' power and divinity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who question the miracle and the authority of Jesus, often representing skepticism and opposition to Jesus' ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parents_of_the_blind_man.htm">The Parents of the Blind Man</a></b><br>They are questioned by the Pharisees about their son's healing, showing fear of the Jewish leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, a significant location for many of Jesus' teachings and miracles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>The parents of the blind man were afraid of the Jewish leaders, but true faith in Christ calls us to stand firm in our testimony, regardless of opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_sight.htm">Spiritual Sight</a></b><br>Physical healing is a metaphor for spiritual awakening.

By verifying the parentage of the healed man, they hope to undermine the miracle. <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a> requires two or three witnesses, so the Pharisees appear to follow lawful procedure while actually looking for a loophole.<p>&#8226; Their tone betrays doubt, much like the earlier cynical question in <a href="/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>. Yet the parents&#8217; simple response in <a href="/john/9-20.htm">John 9:20</a>, &#8220;We know he is our son,&#8221; stands as unassailable testimony.<p>&#8226; God often confirms His works through trustworthy witnesses&#8212;see <a href="/john/5-31.htm">John 5:31-32</a>, where Jesus points to multiple validations of His mission. Here, the parents unwittingly become part of that chain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the one you say was born blind</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;the one you say was born blind?&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-19.htm">John 9:19</a>)<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;you say&#8221; casts suspicion on the parents&#8217; earlier report (<a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>). The leaders imply the blindness could have been imagined or fabricated, revealing hardened hearts much like those who demanded more signs in <a href="/john/6-30.htm">John 6:30</a>.<p>&#8226; Yet Scripture affirms that physical conditions are under God&#8217;s sovereign hand (<a href="/exodus/4-11.htm">Exodus 4:11</a>). The man&#8217;s congenital blindness served &#8220;that the works of God might be displayed in him&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a> foretells that &#8220;the eyes of the blind will see,&#8221; so the very detail they question actually verifies messianic prophecy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So how is it that he can now see</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;So how is it that he can now see?&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-19.htm">John 9:19</a>)<p>&#8226; The miracle is undeniable; the leaders simply refuse its implications. Like Nicodemus in <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>, they recognize that such works point to God, yet they resist bowing to that truth.<p>&#8226; Their demand for an explanation echoes the unbelief of <a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-48</a>, where acknowledging signs still leads to plotting rather than worship.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a> promised, &#8220;Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,&#8221; and <a href="/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a> records Jesus using restored sight as proof of His messianic identity. The question &#8220;How?&#8221; should have led them to faith; instead it exposes their spiritual blindness (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-19.htm">John 9:19</a> shows religious leaders probing for loopholes rather than celebrating God&#8217;s work. They verify the man&#8217;s identity, question the facts of his lifelong blindness, and demand an explanation for the miracle&#8212;all to avoid admitting that Jesus fulfills Isaiah&#8217;s promise to open blind eyes. Their interrogation highlights a tragic irony: while physical sight has been granted, spiritual sight is refused. The verse challenges every reader to acknowledge the clear evidence of Christ&#8217;s power and to move from skeptical questioning to believing worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Is this your son, who ye say was born blind?</span>--The "ye" is emphatic; <span class= "ital">ye</span> say he was born blind, as opposed to us, for we do not believe it.
