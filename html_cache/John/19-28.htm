It refers to the moments after Jesus had ensured the care of His mother by entrusting her to the disciple John (<a href="/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26-27</a>). This highlights Jesus' attention to fulfilling His earthly responsibilities even in His final moments.<p><b>knowing that everything had now been accomplished</b><br>Jesus' awareness that His mission was complete reflects His divine knowledge and purpose.

The specific Scripture being fulfilled here is likely <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, which mentions vinegar given for thirst. Jesus' actions consistently align with Old Testament prophecies, affirming His identity as the Messiah.<p><b>Jesus said, &#8220;I am thirsty.&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights Jesus' humanity and physical suffering on the cross. It also fulfills the prophecy mentioned earlier. The expression of thirst is significant in the context of His crucifixion, as it demonstrates His real human needs and suffering.

In the original the words for "accomplished" and "fulfilled" are derived from the same root, and the latter word is not the ordinary formula of quotation which we have had, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a> (see Note there). The Vulgate has "Postea sciens Jesus quia omnia <span class= "ital">consummata</span> sunt ut <span class= "ital">consummaretur</span> Scriptural Perhaps the nearest English rendering is "that all things were now completed that the Scripture might be accomplished." But then there arises the difficult question, Is this connected with the words which follow, or not? The margin assumes that it is, and refers to <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm" title="They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.">Psalm 69:21</a>. On the other hand (1) St. John's custom is to quote the fulfilment of Scripture as seen in the event after its occurrence; (2) he does not here use the ordinary words which accompany such a reference; (3) the actual meaning of "knowing that all things were now accomplished" seems to exclude the idea of a further accomplishment, and to refer to the whole life which was an accomplishment of Scripture; (4) the context of words as they occur in the Psalm (<a href="/john/19-22.htm" title="Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.">John 19:22</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) cannot be understood of our Lord. There seems to be good reason, therefore, for understanding the words "that the Scripture might be completed," of the events of the whole life, and not of the words which immediately follow. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - (c) "I thirst" - the last agony. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - It does not come within the purpose of John to record the portents which attended the final scene - either the supernatural darkness on the one hand, or the rending of the veil of the temple on the other.
