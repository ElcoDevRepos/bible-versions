This promise of the Advocate is part of Jesus' farewell discourse, providing comfort and assurance to the disciples. The coming of the Advocate is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise to not leave His followers as orphans (<a href="/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>). The Holy Spirit's role as an Advocate is to support and guide believers, continuing the work of Jesus on earth.<p><b>whom I will send to you from the Father</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin and mission of the Holy Spirit. Jesus, in His divine authority, sends the Spirit from the Father, highlighting the unity and cooperation within the Trinity. This sending is a continuation of the mission of Jesus, ensuring that His presence and power remain with the disciples. The sending of the Spirit is a pivotal moment in the New Testament, marking the beginning of the Church's mission at Pentecost (Acts 2).<p><b>the Spirit of truth</b><br>The Holy Spirit is described as the "Spirit of truth," indicating His role in guiding believers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). This title underscores the Spirit's function in revealing and affirming the truth of Jesus' teachings. In a world filled with deception and falsehood, the Spirit of truth provides discernment and understanding, enabling believers to live according to God's will.<p><b>who proceeds from the Father</b><br>This phrase highlights the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father, a theological concept that has been central to Christian doctrine. It affirms the Spirit's divine origin and His intimate relationship with the Father. The procession of the Spirit is a mystery of the Trinity, reflecting the eternal relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<p><b>He will testify about Me</b><br>The Holy Spirit's primary role is to bear witness to Jesus Christ. This testimony involves affirming Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the Savior of the world. The Spirit's testimony is both internal, confirming the truth of the Gospel in the hearts of believers, and external, empowering the Church to proclaim the message of Christ to the world. This testimony fulfills the prophetic role of the Spirit, as seen in the Old Testament, where the Spirit empowered prophets to speak God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_advocate.htm">The Advocate (Paraclete)</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who is promised to come and support, guide, and testify about Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father, from whom the Spirit proceeds, emphasizing the unity and distinct roles within the Trinity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' promise, representing all believers who will receive the Holy Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sending_of_the_spirit.htm">The Sending of the Spirit</a></b><br>The event of the Holy Spirit being sent to believers, which occurs at Pentecost as recorded in <a href="/bsb/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is our Advocate, providing guidance, comfort, and truth.

The pronoun is here emphatic. "Whom <span class= "ital">I</span> will send . . ."

He is the Advocate whom the Son will send from the Father, but He is also and emphatically the Spirit of Truth proceeding from the Father, and His witness therefore will be that of the Father Himself. These two clauses ("whom I will send unto you from the Father," "which proceedeth from the Father") are to be regarded as parallels; and both of them probably refer to the <span class= "ital">office</span> of the Holy Spirit. The Vulgate renders the verb in the latter clause by the word "procedit," and the older expositors generally understood it of the <span class= "ital">person</span> of the Holy Ghost. The Eastern Church, from the days of Theodore of Mopsuestia downwards, have claimed this text as proving the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father only, and have quoted it as decisive against the addition of the "filioque clause" in the Nicene Creed. The Western Church, comparing it with <a href="/john/16-15.htm" title="All things that the Father has are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it to you.">John 16:15</a>, and such texts as <a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

If it refers to the person of the Holy Spirit, it must be granted that the <span class= "ital">ipsissima verba</span> of our Lord are in favour of the interpretation of the Greek Church; but if it refers, as with much greater probability it does, to the office of the Holy Ghost, then <span class= "ital">these</span> words have no bearing upon the doctrinal question at issue.

The expression <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> only occurs in this place, and from it <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> became the ecclesiastical term for the relation which the Holy Spirit sustains to the Father, just as <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> was the especial term to denote the peculiarity of the Son, and just as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the condition of unbegottenness and paternity was that used to denote the Father's own hypostatic distinction. The Holy Spirit is ever proceeding, issuing forth from, sent by the Father on his work of Divine self-manifestation and Divine activity in the universe. Of this there can be no question, and the Nicene symbol originally expressed it without amplification, and the Greeks founded upon it their conception of the Trinity. The relation of the Son and Spirit to the Father were believed to be co-ordinate; and, though both were of the same eternal substance, yet both were equal to the Father. But the Western Church in after-years - notwithstanding the tremendous anathemas against all alteration which guarded the Nicene and Chalcedonian formulae - felt that the whole truth concerning the Divinity of the Son was concealed, if the idea was not also conveyed which our Lord utters side by side with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in this verse. Christ says, "I will send him <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>," and this must be compared with (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>), "whom the Father will send in my Name;" and the Latins, to express this thought, added <span class="accented">filioque</span> to the phrase, "proceeding from the Father," and claimed our Lord as equally the Source of the Divine Spirit with the Father, so that it runs, "proceeding from the Father and the Son." In the endless discussions that arose, the two Churches probably meant to effect the same thing, viz. to affirm the glory and perfect Deity of the Lord Christ. The Greeks, in ancient times, never limited their statement to proceeding from the Father <span class="accented">only</span>;" nor did they object to add, "through or by the Son;" but it is probable that Augustine and the Western Church, and the liturgical forms that arose in it, approach a little more closely to the reality and quality of him who said, "I and my Father are one" in this respect, that the Spirit proceedeth from the Father and Son, when he comes into human hearts and testifies of Christ. There are those (Beza, Luthardt, Alford, Meyer) who urge that these passages do not bear at all upon the internal relations of the Godhead, but simply refer to the temporal mission of the Holy Spirit. "The words," says Luthardt, "must be understood historically, not metaphysically," and much may be said in favor of this view. If this verse does not furnish the basis of an argument, there is no other which can be advanced to establish the view either of the Eastern or Western Church. The witness of the Paraclete is said here to cover the gravest difficulties and provide the richest consolations. If the Lord intended to teach the fundamental nature of the Holy Spirit, the literal statement would be a powerful defense of the Greek doctrine; but if the passage here speaks of the official work and temporal mission, the words have no direct bearing upon that doctrine. The <span class="accented">denial</span> of the <span class="accented">filioque</span> has the logical tendency to make the Spirit and Son co-ordinate and subordinate emanations of the Father, and so to go back to the monarchianism from which the Church escaped at Nicaea. (See Pearson on the Creed, art. 8; 'Dict. Christian Biography,' art. "Holy Ghost;" Smeaten, 'Doctrine of the Holy Spirit;' Hagenbach, 'History of Christian Doctrines.') The supernatural power of the Holy Spirit will counteract the hatred in the world by regenerating individuals within it. More than that, said Christ, he (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) will bear witness to me, in the Divine strength and courage which he will give to you, in the new and corrective ideas which he will supply, in the great works seen to be mine, which you will have grace to initiate (see <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> , - passages where the "Acts of the Apostles" are seen to be "Acts of the Risen Jesus"); and <span class="accented">ye also bear witness</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. Your own experience of me from the commencement of my ministry will give you a class of testimony which will leave an indelible impression on the heart of the world. <p>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/15-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Hotan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3752.htm">Strong's 3752: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, whenever.
