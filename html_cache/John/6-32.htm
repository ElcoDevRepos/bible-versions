It emphasizes the authority and importance of His forthcoming statement. In the context of the Gospel of John, Jesus often uses direct speech to reveal deeper spiritual truths.<p><b>&#8220;Truly, truly, I tell you,</b><br>The repetition of "truly" (Greek: "amen, amen") is a solemn affirmation, underscoring the truth and significance of what Jesus is about to say. This phrase is unique to Jesus in the Gospels and serves to highlight the importance of His teachings, demanding the listener's attention and belief.<p><b>it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven,</b><br>Here, Jesus corrects a common Jewish belief that Moses was the provider of manna in the wilderness. This reference to Moses connects to the Exodus narrative (Exodus 16), where God provided manna to the Israelites. Jesus clarifies that Moses was not the source; rather, it was God who provided. This distinction is crucial in understanding the role of divine provision versus human agency.<p><b>but it is My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</b><br>Jesus shifts the focus from the past provision of manna to the present and ongoing provision from God the Father. The "true bread" signifies something greater than physical sustenance, pointing to Jesus Himself as the spiritual sustenance necessary for eternal life. This statement foreshadows Jesus' later declaration in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, "I am the bread of life." The use of "My Father" emphasizes Jesus' unique relationship with God, highlighting His divine authority and mission. This phrase also connects to the broader theme of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament types and prophecies, such as the manna being a type of Christ, the true sustenance from heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the crowd following the feeding of the 5,000.

They had implied a contrast between their fathers and themselves, between Moses and Jesus. They expressed the glory of the Mosaic sign in the language of the Psalm; but there the gift is ascribed to God, and it is named to mark the darkness of their unbelief. The gift of God was ever the same. He it was who gave then; He it is who ever giveth. "You think of Moses; but Moses was the messenger of My Father. You speak of bread from heaven; but heaven is My home, from which I am come to give the true bread to the world, which in very truth is its sustenance."

The kind of strength which will arise within you when once appropriated, is an eternal possession, an abiding advantage; the satisfaction is not exhausted by a short interval, it remains forever. The Son of man is entrusted with power to bestow it. He is sealed and sanctified and sent into the world for this purpose. This bread is veritably from heaven. Moses did not even give, nor was he the almoner even of, the manna. All the giving then was God's work, but he whom God has sent, on whom you have to believe, is a veritable Giver of this true bread from heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
