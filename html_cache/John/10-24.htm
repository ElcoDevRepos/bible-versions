The gathering suggests a confrontation or a demand for clarity. In the context of <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, Jesus is in Jerusalem during the Feast of Dedication (Hanukkah), a time when many Jews would be present. The gathering around Jesus can be seen as a sign of their increasing tension and opposition to His ministry. This setting in Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish religious life, underscores the significance of their inquiry.<p><b>and demanded,</b><br>The use of the word "demanded" reflects the urgency and intensity of their request. It implies a lack of patience and possibly a confrontational attitude. This demand is not a polite request but an insistence on an answer. The Jewish leaders were often skeptical of Jesus' claims and sought to challenge Him, as seen in other parts of the Gospels where they question His authority and teachings.<p><b>&#8220;How long will You keep us in suspense?</b><br>This question reveals their frustration and perhaps a sense of exasperation. The phrase "keep us in suspense" suggests that they felt Jesus was being ambiguous or evasive about His identity. However, throughout His ministry, Jesus had provided numerous signs and teachings that pointed to His identity as the Messiah. The suspense they felt was more a result of their own unbelief and misunderstanding rather than any lack of clarity on Jesus' part.<p><b>If You are the Christ,</b><br>The term "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." The Jews were expecting a Messiah who would deliver them from Roman oppression and restore the kingdom of Israel. Their question reflects a political and national expectation rather than a spiritual understanding of the Messiah's role. Throughout the Old Testament, prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> pointed to the coming of a Messiah who would have a divine and eternal kingdom.<p><b>tell us plainly.&#8221;</b><br>The request for a plain statement indicates their desire for an unequivocal declaration from Jesus. However, Jesus often spoke in parables and used metaphors, such as being the "Good Shepherd" earlier in <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, to reveal His identity to those with faith while concealing it from those who were hard-hearted. This request for plainness also highlights their spiritual blindness, as Jesus had already made His identity clear to those willing to see and hear.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>In this context, "the Jews" refers to the religious leaders and people in Jerusalem who were questioning Jesus.

The words exactly express what was probably the real state of fluctuation in which many of these Jews then were. They do not in the true sense "believe" (<a href="/context/john/10-25.htm" title="Jesus answered them, I told you, and you believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.">John 10:25-26</a>), and they soon pass to the other extreme of seeking to stone Him (<a href="/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31</a>); but in many of them the last miracle, and the words accompanying it, had left a conviction that He was more than human, and not possessed by a demon. (See Note on <a href="/john/10-21.htm" title="Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?">John 10:21</a>.) Two months have passed away, not, we may believe, without many an earnest thought and much anxious weighing of evidence concerning Him. And now the Feast of Dedication has come, and what thoughts have come with it? It is the Feast of Lights, and He had declared Himself the Light of the world. It is the Feast of Freedom, telling how the Maccabees had freed their nation from the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, and He has declared that "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed" (<a href="/john/8-36.htm" title="If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.">John 8:36</a>). It is the feast which commemorates the cleansing of the Temple, and His first public appearance in the Temple was to cleanse it and claim it as His Father's house. May there not be, then, a close connection between the statement that "it was the Feast of the Dedication," and the question, "How long dost thou excite our souls?" Was He, the question would seem to ask, really the Messiah or not? though by the Messiah they mean only a temporal prince. Was He, like the Judas of whom they were thinking, raised up as a deliverer from the Roman power, to give them the freedom which had long been the national dream?<p><span class= "bld">If thou be the Christ, tell us.</span>--Comp.

They had heard his parables, and say, "Let him drop all reserve, and deliver himself in categoric form." Archdeacon Watkins has well recalled the various utterances which fell on the more susceptible of the Jerusalemites. This was the Feast of Lights, and has he not called himself the Light of the world? This was a feast commemorative of freedom from the Syrian yoke, and had he not said, "If the Son set you free, ye shall be free indeed"? ' This was the Feast of the Purification of the Temple; had not his first act been a cleansing of the courts of the temple? We cannot wonder at the summons and challenge of the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
