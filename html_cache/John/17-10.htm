It echoes the concept of divine ownership and stewardship found throughout Scripture, where everything belongs to God (<a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). This unity is foundational to understanding the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet one in essence. The phrase also highlights Jesus' submission to the Father's will, a theme prevalent in His earthly ministry (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>).<p><b>and all You have is Mine;</b><br>Here, Jesus asserts His divine authority and equality with the Father. This statement is a profound declaration of His deity, affirming that He shares in the divine nature and possesses all that the Father has. This is consistent with other New Testament passages that speak of Christ's preeminence and authority over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>). It also reflects the mutual indwelling and shared glory between the Father and the Son, a mystery central to Christian theology.<p><b>and in them I have been glorified.</b><br>This phrase refers to the disciples and, by extension, all believers. Jesus is glorified in His followers as they live out His teachings and reflect His character to the world. This glorification is not just future but present, as believers embody the transformative power of the Gospel. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God's glory being revealed through His people (<a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>). The disciples' faith and obedience bring honor to Jesus, fulfilling His mission and demonstrating the effectiveness of His work on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is in the midst of His High Priestly Prayer, addressing God the Father.

Our transformed lives testify that the Son and the Father are one, and His honor radiates through us now and forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And all mine are thine, and thine are mine.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And all My things are Thine, and Thy things are Mine.</span> The Authorised version leaves the impression that the pronouns are masculine, and that persons are exclusively meant; whereas the words are all-inclusive, and assert absolute community in all things between the Father and the Son.<p><span class= "bld">And I am glorified in them.</span>--The division of verses is unfortunate, as the last words of this verse are closely connected with the last words of <a href="/john/17-9.htm" title="I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you have given me; for they are yours.">John 17:9</a>, and the general assertion which intervenes is a parenthesis. The thought is, "For they are Thine (and all My things are Thine, and Thy things are Mine), and I am glorified in them." The fact that Christ is glorified in them forms, then, a second reason for His special prayer for them. The tense is perfect. Its accomplishment is already in part realised (<a href="/context/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6-8</a>; comp. <a href="/john/15-8.htm" title="Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.">John 15:8</a>), and is more fully to be realised in that future of the Spirit's work which all through this chapter is regarded as present. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/16-14.htm" title="He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it to you.">John 16:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all things that are mine are thine</span>; whether they be these souls, or these powers that I wield, or these words that I utter, or these works that I do, - all <span class="accented">are thine</span>. This statement is in perfect harmony with all his teaching, and is not incompatible with the reverential sentiment that any servant of God might utter; but he adds words to show that the union between him and the Father is much closer than this, and quite unique. <span class="cmt_word">And thine are mine</span>. Luther observed, "No creature could say this." Perhaps he went too far, because we are taught to believe that "<span class="accented">all</span> things are ours," etc., and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> covers much (see <a href="/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). In the full confidence of filial relation we can believe it true that the heavenly Father <span class="accented">says to</span> every one of his veritable children, "<span class="accented">All</span> that I have is thine." Here the words must not be drawn out of their connection; it is human souls who are of God, and are therefore Christ's. The dogmatic lesson is that every one who has heard and learned of the Father does come to him. Such an assurance gives a sublime hope to the world, <span class="cmt_word">and I</span> (<span class="accented">have been and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>am glorified in them</span>. Once more the Divine Savior rejoices in the victory he has won in securing the faith of the disciples.
