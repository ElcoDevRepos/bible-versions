In the context of <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>, Jesus is responding to His disciples' concerns about returning to Judea, where there was danger. His answers often reveal spiritual truths and challenge conventional thinking.<p><b>Are there not twelve hours of daylight?</b><br>This rhetorical question refers to the Jewish understanding of a day divided into twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of night. It emphasizes the fixed nature of time and God's sovereign control over it. The number twelve often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles.<p><b>If anyone walks in the daytime,</b><br>Walking in the daytime symbolizes living in the light of God's truth and guidance. In biblical times, travel was safer during daylight, reflecting the spiritual safety found in following God's will. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to light and darkness, such as in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp to one's feet.<p><b>he will not stumble,</b><br>Stumbling is often used metaphorically in Scripture to describe falling into sin or error. Walking in the light of God's truth prevents spiritual stumbling. This concept is echoed in 1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>, which speaks of walking in the light as He is in the light.<p><b>because he sees by the light of this world.</b><br>The "light of this world" can be understood as the natural light provided by the sun, but it also points to Jesus Himself, who is described as the Light of the World in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>. This dual meaning underscores the importance of both physical and spiritual illumination.

His answer would say that the darkness of the night which they dreaded could not come yet. The natural night would come not until its appointed hour, until the twelve hours of the day had run their course. The day of His life is marked out by limits no less sure. The night indeed cometh, but it is as yet full day, and in that day He and they must do the work which is appointed of the Father.

If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</span> The answer of Jesus is a further deliverance concerning the human law and season (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) of work - a parable drawn from earthly and human analogies, which will unquestionably have a direct bearing on the conditions of Divine service at all time, and is therefore applicable to the disciples with himself. It receives also special significance from some aspects of Christ's own ministry, and from the step he had just now declared that he intended to take. Of course, the parable is based upon the conditions of human work; one of these conditions is <span class="accented">light</span>, another of them is <span class="accented">time</span>. Light is necessary for all the wise efforts of men - the light of day, the light of this world or the sun; we must see whither we are going, in order to avoid the occasions of stumbling. We must submit to this comprehensive condition, or we fail (cf. here <a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>, "I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; the night cometh, when no man can work"). There are two kinds of night of which he speaks. One is the night which arrests all labor, the night of death; and the other is the night of ignorance and unbelief, when the light that is in a man becomes darkness, when, if a man does attempt to work or walk, he will stumble. Meyer and some others, from the reference to another condition, viz. that of <span class="accented">time</span>, persist in limiting the notion of the <span class="accented">day</span> to that of the period of service, about which the Lord says also some very solemn things; and Meyer objects to Luthardt and others, who give to the sun, to the light of this world, any moral or spiritual meaning. We need not limit the application. Light may mean knowledge of duty supplied by God's providence and the revelation of his will, and so far as "day" is made by light, it is important to notice it here. But <span class="accented">time</span> is an equally important condition, and whereas in <a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4, 5</a> the Lord laid emphasis upon the <span class="accented">limited</span> amount of opportunity during which the light lasts and the work can be done; so here there is an <span class="accented">appointed</span> period during which stumbling is unnecessary: "twelve hours in the day." This (I take to be Christ's meaning) is one of these hours, and before the night comes "I must work." Godet suggests that the disciples, by this question, recommended him not to shorten his career by courting danger, and so to create for himself "a thirteenth hour" to the day, in which he would secure no blessing; that the Lord condemned the proposal, knowing that he was immortal till his hour had come; and that if we shrink from a call of duty, and thus save ourselves, adding an unhallowed increment to our day of useless work, we incur the like condemnation, we shall stumble. Let it be observed that the reason for working in the night is not because we have twelve hours for duty and no more, but because, though we have a time of service and an opportunity, we have let both slip past us, and then the work is difficult and perilous if we do attempt it. Some have said that Judas, Peter, Thomas, <span class="accented">etc</span>., walked in the night, and that they stumbled and fell. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Are there</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eisin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
