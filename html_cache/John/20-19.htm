This day became known as the Lord's Day in early Christianity, distinguishing it from the Jewish Sabbath, which is observed on Saturday. The resurrection on this day fulfills Jesus' prophecy about rising on the third day and sets a precedent for Christian worship and gathering.<p><b>and that very evening</b><br>The evening of the resurrection day is crucial as it shows the immediacy of Jesus' appearances to His disciples. This timing emphasizes the continuity of His presence and the fulfillment of His promise to rise again. It also highlights the transition from the despair of the crucifixion to the hope of the resurrection within a single day.<p><b>while the disciples were together</b><br>The gathering of the disciples indicates their unity and shared experience of fear and uncertainty following Jesus' crucifixion. This communal aspect is significant as it reflects the early Christian practice of meeting together for support, prayer, and worship, which is echoed in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>.<p><b>with the doors locked for fear of the Jews</b><br>The locked doors symbolize the disciples' fear of persecution from Jewish authorities, who had been instrumental in Jesus' crucifixion. This fear is rooted in the historical context of Jewish leaders' opposition to Jesus' ministry. The locked doors also serve to highlight the miraculous nature of Jesus' appearance, as He enters despite the physical barriers.<p><b>Jesus came and stood among them</b><br>Jesus' sudden appearance among the disciples demonstrates His glorified, resurrected body, which transcends physical limitations. This act reassures the disciples of His victory over death and His divine nature. It also fulfills His promise in <a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>, where He assures His presence among those gathered in His name.<p><b>&#8220;Peace be with you!&#8221; He said to them</b><br>The greeting "Peace be with you" is more than a customary salutation; it conveys the deep peace that comes from reconciliation with God through Christ's sacrifice. This peace fulfills the promise of <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, where Jesus assures His disciples of peace not as the world gives.

Consequently, after most astounding and independent revelations had been made to several individuals, about 8 p.m. there occurred that which John now proceeds to describe. The note of time identifies it with the scene and event described by Luke (<a href="/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36-43</a>); consequently John had the former account before him in the record of his own reminiscences. To understand the full force of the passage we must bring to it the statements of Luke, Mark, and Paul. The disciples had been prepared, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the reports of the women, that the grave had been opened and was empty, and that angelic appearances had asserted the resurrection of Jesus. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> By the impression made on Peter and John when they found it as Mary and the other women had said. The disappearance of the body of Jesus, confirmed by the four independent lines of testimony, is strangely difficult to account for on any hypothesis except that of the Resurrection. The disciples were evidently confounded by the fact. The Pharisees and priestly party were quite aware that such an event would checkmate their supposed victory over a hated rival. The Roman soldiers were pledged in honor and by pride and passion not to allow themselves thus to be reduced to impotence. Hence there is no explanation of the rise or beginning of such a legend (see B. Weiss, 'Life of Jesus,' 3. pp. 390-395), except the historical fact.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">It was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8020;&#963;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Ous&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
