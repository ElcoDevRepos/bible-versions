His presence here highlights his loyalty, despite his impending denial. The "another disciple" is traditionally understood to be John, the author of the Gospel, though he remains unnamed. This anonymity may reflect humility or a literary technique to focus on the narrative rather than the individual. The act of following Jesus at this critical moment demonstrates the disciples' initial courage and commitment, even as they face potential danger. This scene occurs after Jesus' arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane, a pivotal moment leading to His crucifixion.<p><b>Since that disciple was known to the high priest,</b><br>The phrase indicates a unique relationship between the unnamed disciple and the high priest, suggesting a level of influence or access not available to all. This connection may have been due to family ties, social standing, or previous interactions. The high priest at the time was Caiaphas, a significant figure in the trial of Jesus. This relationship allowed the disciple to gain entry into the high priest's courtyard, providing an eyewitness account of the events that unfolded. The high priest's role was central in Jewish religious life, overseeing temple activities and maintaining order, which adds gravity to the unfolding events.<p><b>he also went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.</b><br>The courtyard of the high priest was likely part of a larger complex, possibly including living quarters and administrative areas. Archaeological findings suggest such courtyards were common in affluent homes of the period, often used for gatherings and official business. The disciple's entry into this space signifies a transition from public ministry to the private, judicial proceedings that would lead to Jesus' crucifixion. This setting underscores the tension between Jesus' teachings and the religious authorities. The courtyard becomes a stage for Peter's denial, fulfilling Jesus' earlier prophecy and illustrating the human struggle with fear and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and later denial of Jesus.

It agrees also with the fact that Peter and John are elsewhere found in special connection with each other (<a href="/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8</a>; <a href="/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>; <a href="/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="/context/acts/3-3.htm" title="Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.">Acts 3:3-4</a>; <a href="/acts/3-11.htm" title="And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.">Acts 3:11</a>; <a href="/acts/4-13.htm" title="Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.">Acts 4:13</a>; <a href="/acts/4-19.htm" title="But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, judge you.">Acts 4:19</a>; <a href="/acts/8-14.htm" title="Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:">Acts 8:14</a>). We are warranted, therefore, in saying that this opinion is probable, but not in assuming that it is necessarily true, as is often done. It may be, for instance, that by this term the Evangelist indicates his brother James, who is never mentioned in this Gospel. The fact that he is himself called "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (<a href="/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>; <a href="/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>; comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 375), is against rather than for the opinion that he is here called "another disciple." If we adopt the reading, "<span class= "ital">the</span> other disciple," the opinion has more support. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>. After the first dispersion of all the disciples, two of them gathered up their courage. <span class="cmt_word">Simon Peter was following Jesus</span> "afar off" (say all the synoptists), "even <span class="accented">up to"</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f64;&#x3c2;</span>, the court of the high priest" (say Matthew and Mark). The account of Matthew implies that, having come up to the door, he went <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, and sat down to see the end; he does not say how he was admitted, though, by the use of the two prepositions, he implies there was a cause. And also <span class="cmt_word">another</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciple: but that disciple was known to the high priest,</span> and therefore to the officials, <span class="cmt_word">and went fix with Jesus into</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, right within) <span class="cmt_word">the court of the high priest</span>; for he was well known to be, and from the first did not pretend to be anything else than, one of the disciples of Jesus. From the known habit of the evangelist in other places, the vast majority of commentators at once conclude (see Introduction, p. 54.) that the writer designates himself by this reference. Godet and Watkins are disposed to question it, and imagine that it may have been the author's brother James. With the absence of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the matter is left in doubt. But by this supposition much of the justification is lost, which the writer of the Gospel quietly supplies, touching his own ability to describe what otherwise would never have entered into the evangelic narrative. The supposition we have made above, that Annas and Caiaphas occupied the same palace, or different portions of the same edifice, solves the chief difficulty. Annas held his preliminary unofficial inquiry in his department of the building. The difficult question arises whether Annas was assisted or not by the reigning "high priest" in conducting this examination (see Ver. 19). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Simon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Sim&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4613.htm">Strong's 4613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simon.
