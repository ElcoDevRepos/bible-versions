In the context of first-century Judaism, religious leaders and scholars were highly respected for their knowledge of the Scriptures and the Law. Jesus, who was not formally trained in the rabbinical schools, spoke with authority and wisdom that surpassed the expectations of the people. This amazement is a recurring theme in the Gospels, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>, where the crowds were astonished at His teaching because He taught as one having authority.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;How did this man attain such learning</b><br>The question reflects the cultural and educational norms of the time. Jewish education was centered around the Torah, and young boys would begin their studies at an early age. Advanced learning was typically reserved for those who studied under a rabbi. Jesus' profound understanding of the Scriptures without formal training was perplexing to the Jewish leaders. This scenario is reminiscent of <a href="/luke/2-46.htm">Luke 2:46-47</a>, where Jesus, as a young boy, was found in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking questions, and all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.<p><b>without having studied?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine nature of Jesus' wisdom. Unlike the scribes and Pharisees, who relied on human instruction and tradition, Jesus' knowledge was innate and divinely inspired. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which speaks of the Spirit of the Lord resting upon the Messiah, granting Him wisdom and understanding. Jesus' ability to teach without formal study serves as a testament to His identity as the Son of God, who embodies the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish leaders and people present at the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem.

It is not the substance of His teaching that excites their attention, but the fact that He who has never been technically trained as a Rabbi is acquainted with the literature of the schools. (See <a href="/acts/26-24.htm" title="And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.">Acts 26:24</a>, "much learning," where "learning" represents the word here rendered "letters.")

The immediate effect of the appearance and words was great astonishment. In spite of themselves, they are moved by the command he manifested over all the springs of thought and feeling. The point of their astonishment is, not that he is wise and true, but that he could teach without having been taught in their schools. <span class="cmt_word">How doth this man know letters?</span> (not the "Holy Scriptures," <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, nor <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, but simply <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, literature, such as we teach it; cf. <a href="/acts/26-24.htm">Acts 26:24</a>). He can interpret our oracles; he is acquainted with the methods of teaching, <span class="cmt_word">though he has not learned</span> - has never sat in any of our schools. Saul of Tarsus was brought up at the feet of Gomaliel. And ordinarily a man was compelled to undergo a lengthened noviciate in the schools before he was allowed to assume the office of a teacher. The inherited wisdom of the past is in the great majority of cases the basis of the most conspicuous teaching of the most original and unique of the great sages. The "Jews" were sufficiently acquainted with the origin and training of Jesus to be astonished at his knowledge of the interpretations of Scripture and other wisdom. "This tells powerfully against all attempts, ancient and modern, to trace back the wisdom of Jesus to some school of human culture" (Meyer). The attempts to establish a connection between the teaching of Christ and the hidden wisdom of the Zendavesta, or esoteric utterances of Buddha, or even the traditionary teaching of the Essenes, or the Platonizing schools of Alexandria or Ephesus, have failed. The mystery of his training as a man in the village of Nazareth is one of the evidences given to the world that there was an unknown element in his consciousness. He had not even the advantage of the schools of Hillel or Gamaliel. His own wondrous soul, by much pondering on the genuine significance of the Scriptures, is the only explanation to which even his enemies can appeal. Jesus knew the meaning, heard the murmuring of their surprise on this head, and so we read - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
