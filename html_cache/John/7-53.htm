In the context of <a href="/john/7.htm">John 7</a>, Jesus had been teaching at the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival. The use of "then" suggests a shift from the public discourse and debate about Jesus' identity to a more private setting.<p><b>each</b><br>The term "each" refers to the individuals present at the scene, likely including the crowd, religious leaders, and possibly the disciples. This highlights the personal decision of every individual to leave the public gathering. It underscores the varied responses to Jesus' teachings, as some were intrigued, others skeptical, and some hostile.<p><b>went</b><br>The action of going implies a departure from the temple area where Jesus had been teaching. This movement signifies the end of a significant moment of public teaching and interaction. It also reflects the normalcy of returning to daily life after a religious festival, a common practice in Jewish culture.<p><b>to his own home</b><br>This phrase indicates a return to personal and private spaces. In the Jewish context, the home was a place of family, rest, and reflection. The mention of "his own home" suggests a return to familiar surroundings where individuals could ponder the events and teachings they had witnessed. It also contrasts with Jesus, who often had no place to lay His head, highlighting His unique mission and sacrifice. This phrase can also be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual state of individuals, as some may have returned unchanged, while others may have been deeply affected by Jesus' words.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the Gospel of John, whose teachings and actions are the focus of the account.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>- The people who had gathered in Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles, listening to Jesus' teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city where the events of <a href="/bsb/john/7.htm">John 7</a> take place, particularly during the Feast of Tabernacles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>- A significant Jewish festival that serves as the backdrop for the events in <a href="/bsb/john/7.htm">John 7</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees_and_chief_priests.htm">The Pharisees and Chief Priests</a></b><br>- Religious leaders who were often in opposition to Jesus and His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_choice_of_response.htm">The Choice of Response</a></b><br>Each person went to their own home, symbolizing the personal decision each must make regarding Jesus' teachings.
