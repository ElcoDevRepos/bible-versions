The context is the miraculous event of Jesus walking on water, which follows the feeding of the 5,000. The disciples' willingness to take Jesus into the boat signifies a moment of faith and recognition of His divine authority. This act can be seen as a metaphor for accepting Christ into one's life, reflecting the broader theme of faith and trust in Jesus. The Sea of Galilee, where this event occurs, is known for sudden storms, symbolizing life's challenges that can only be calmed by Jesus' presence.<p><b>and at once the boat reached the shore</b><br>This phrase indicates the miraculous nature of the event. The immediate arrival at the shore suggests divine intervention, emphasizing Jesus' control over nature and time. This miracle parallels other instances where Jesus demonstrates His power over creation, such as calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). It also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's dominion over the earth (<a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a>). The sudden arrival can be seen as a type of the believer's journey, where faith in Christ leads to the ultimate destination of eternal life.<p><b>where they were heading</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose and direction provided by Jesus. The disciples had a destination, and with Jesus' presence, they reached it safely and swiftly. This can be interpreted as a spiritual lesson about the guidance and assurance that comes from following Christ. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's people being led to their promised destination, reminiscent of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land. The phrase suggests that with Jesus, believers are assured of reaching their spiritual goals and fulfilling God's plan for their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority and power over nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who were in the boat, experiencing fear and uncertainty before Jesus' intervention.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boat.htm">The Boat</a></b><br>The vessel carrying the disciples across the Sea of Galilee, symbolizing the journey of faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_galilee.htm">The Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>The body of water where this miraculous event took place, often a setting for Jesus' teachings and miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shore.htm">The Shore</a></b><br>Represents the destination and fulfillment of the journey, reached miraculously after Jesus enters the boat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_presence_in_times_of_fear.htm">Divine Presence in Times of Fear</a></b><br>Just as Jesus calmed the disciples' fears by His presence, believers can find peace in knowing that Christ is with them in life's storms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/immediate_deliverance.htm">Immediate Deliverance</a></b><br>The instant arrival at the shore signifies that Jesus can bring swift resolution and peace to our troubled situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/willingness_to_receive_christ.htm">Willingness to Receive Christ</a></b><br>The disciples' willingness to take Jesus into the boat is a metaphor for inviting Him into our lives, allowing His power to work in us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_overcomes_fear.htm">Faith Overcomes Fear</a></b><br>The disciples' transition from fear to faith illustrates the transformative power of trusting in Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/miraculous_provision.htm">Miraculous Provision</a></b><br>This event is a reminder of Jesus' ability to provide for our needs, both physical and spiritual, in unexpected ways.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_6_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 6:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_6_21_Jesus_control_over_nature.htm">How does John 6:21 demonstrate Jesus' authority over nature and circumstances?

The Greek cannot mean more than, "Then they were willing to receive Him." They are re-assured by His voice, and their fears cease. That they did receive Him into the ship is stated by St. Matthew and St. Mark, and is implied here. That the words may mean more than a "wish" to receive Him is shown by St. John's usage in <a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>; <a href="/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>; <a href="/john/8-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.">John 8:34</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">whither they were going.</span> It follows from <a href="/john/6-19.htm" title="So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship: and they were afraid.">John 6:19</a> that they were at this time about half-way across the lake--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from two to three miles from the shore. No such explanation as that they were near the shore, but in the darkness and confusion of the storm did not know it, is consistent with the plain meaning of these definite words. On the other hand, it is not necessary to suppose that St. John here adds the narrative of another miracle. Where all was miraculous this may well, indeed, have been thought so too; but the analogy of the miracles of our Lord does not lead us to expect the use of divine power to accomplish what was within the reach of human effort. It would on this supposition be difficult to understand why the earlier Gospels omit what would surely have seemed to be among the greatest miracles, and why St. John mentions it only in a passing sentence. The words appear rather to contrast the ease and rapidity with which the second half of the voyage was accomplished in His presence, before which the winds and waves were hushed into a calm, and their fears and doubts passed into courage and hope; with the first half, when the sea kept rising, and a strong wind kept blowing, and they rowed against it for five-and-twenty or thirty furlongs. The word rendered "immediately"--which is more exactly our <span class= "ital">straight-way</span>--may find its full meaning in the straight line of the boat's after-course, as contrasted with its being tossed hither and thither during the storm. The whole context seems to find its full meaning in the sense of difficulty and danger before our Lord was received into the boat, and in the sense of safety and peace afterwards. The Psalmist of the English <span class= "ital">Christian Year</span> has expressed this in familiar words--<p>"Thou Framer of the light and dark,<p>Steer through the tempest Thine own ark; . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they were willing to receive him into the ship: and straightway the ship was at the land whither they were going</span>. Some expositors, who find discrepancy between this statement and that of the synoptists, say, "they were willing, but did not do it," <span class="accented">because</span> the vessel is said by some remarkable process to have been miraculously propelled to the shore (so Lucke, Meyer). There are many passages, however, where a similar expression is used, and where no doubt arises that that which the actors were willing to do they actually did (see <a href="/mark/12-38.htm">Mark 12:38</a>; certainly scribes were not only willing to, but actually did, wear long robes). Chrysostom felt this difficulty, and actually proposed to read <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which would remove the difficulty; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> veritably contains this reading, but it has every appearance of an unauthorized correction. The imperfect tense implies a lengthened willingness supervening on fear and outcry - a willingness or wish increased by the sound of his voice, following his first action, his apparent resolve to pass by them; and, still more, by the incident described in Matthew's Gospel, of Peter's desire to display the strength of his faith and the eminence of his position among the twelve. This occupied time, during which the wind may have been bearing them briskly in their true direction. They willed, wished, to take him into the ship, and did so, and the calm supervened as described in Matthew and Mark. Their wish is not frustrated by the fact now mentioned, but accompanied by it. "Straightway," etc. Most expositors confess this to be an additional miracle, that the twenty furlongs or thereabouts (two miles and a half) were suddenly traversed and miraculously abolished. There would be a greater miracle in this than in the two events which preceded. The annihilation of space and time is the obliteration of the very categories of thought, and would, if conveyed by the statement, suggest a <span class="accented">stupendous</span> and, so far as we can see, a useless portent. It would strongly tempt us to accept the rationalistic interpretation. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> does not always mean "instantaneously," but simply that the next thing to notice or observe was the fact described. Take <a href="/mark/1-21.htm">Mark 1:21, 29</a>. It does not mean that any miraculous rapidity characterized the movement of Christ to the house of Simon and Andrew (<a href="/mark/4-17.htm">Mark 4:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a> 3John 14 <a href="/john/13-32.htm">John 13:32</a>; and many other passages). The author of the "Christian Year" has consecrated in sweet lines the supposed addition to the miracle - <p><span class="accented">"Thou Framer of the light and dark,<br />Steer through the tempest thine own ark;<br />Amid the howling wintry sea,<br />We are in port, if we have thee."</span> But there are so many ways in which this "straightway" may be reconciled with an ordinary disembarkation, that there is no necessity to regard it as implied in John's narrative. John so often leaves gaps unfilled in his chronology and horology that no peat emphasis need be laid upon the annihilation (save in his adoring thought) of the hour before the dawn. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
