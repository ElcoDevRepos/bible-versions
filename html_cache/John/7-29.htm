Unlike the religious leaders and the general populace, Jesus claims a direct and personal relationship with God. This assertion aligns with the prologue of John's Gospel, where it is stated that "the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>). Jesus' knowledge of the Father is not merely intellectual but experiential, highlighting His divine nature and pre-existence. This claim would have been provocative to His audience, who prided themselves on their knowledge of God through the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>because I am from Him</b><br>Here, Jesus asserts His divine origin, indicating that He comes directly from God. This statement reflects the theological concept of the Incarnation, where Jesus, though fully human, is also fully divine. The phrase "I am from Him" suggests pre-existence and a heavenly origin, which is consistent with other passages in John, such as <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us." This claim challenges the Jewish understanding of the Messiah as merely a human deliverer and points to Jesus' unique role in salvation history.<p><b>and He sent Me.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the mission and authority of Jesus. The concept of being "sent" by God is significant in the Gospel of John, as it implies divine commissioning and purpose. Jesus is not acting on His own initiative but is fulfilling the will of the Father. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of prophets and messengers being sent by God to deliver His message, as seen in the Old Testament. However, Jesus is more than a prophet; He is the Son of God, sent to accomplish the work of redemption. This mission is further elaborated in <a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, "For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking about His divine origin and mission.
