The titles "Lord" and "Teacher" reflect His divine authority and His role as a rabbi or master. In Jewish culture, a rabbi was a respected teacher of the law, and disciples were expected to follow their rabbi's teachings closely. Jesus' use of these titles emphasizes His position and the significance of His actions. The term "Lord" also connects to Old Testament references to God, highlighting Jesus' divine nature (e.g., <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). <p><b>have washed your feet,</b><br>Foot washing was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern culture due to the dusty roads and the wearing of sandals. It was typically a task for the lowest servant in a household. By washing His disciples' feet, Jesus demonstrates humility and servanthood, subverting the cultural norms of His time. This act prefigures His ultimate act of service and sacrifice on the cross. It also fulfills the prophecy of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who humbles Himself for the sake of others.<p><b>you also should wash one another&#8217;s feet.</b><br>This command is a call to emulate Jesus' example of humility and service. It is not merely a literal instruction but a broader principle of serving others selflessly. This teaching aligns with other New Testament passages that emphasize love and service, such as <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-7</a>, where believers are encouraged to have the same mindset as Christ. The act of foot washing symbolizes the cleansing and forgiveness that believers are to extend to one another, reflecting the forgiveness they have received through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is both Lord and Teacher, demonstrating humility and servanthood by washing the disciples' feet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are present during the Last Supper.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> shows that he had set before his disciples a parallel, an example, a symbolic type of the service they were to render to one another, and was not establishing a custom or exact ordinance. The washing of the feet was an Oriental custom of great antiquity as a mark of hospitality (<a href="/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; Abigail, <a href="/1_samuel/25-41.htm">1 Samuel 25:41</a>; see also <a href="/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38, 44</a>). In <a href="/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10</a> there is trace of such a custom of Christian hospitality. Considering the ease with which the Church has established a ceremonial from an isolated text, it is remarkable that no more literal use has been made of this injunction. However, <span class="accented">Maundy Thursday</span>, a name derived from <span class="accented">Dies mandati</span>, was celebrated as the day on which this great command, or that contained in ver. 34, was <span class="accented">given - Mandatum novum do vobis - and</span> the feet of the newly baptized were washed. The endeavor to make Augustine the authority for this religious practice is doubtful; but the Council of Toledo (A.D. 694) mentions this particular day as that on which it was appropriate. In the early Gallican Church there was such a ritual, and the forms of <span class="accented">pedilavium</span> observed are to be read in early Gothic and Galliean missals. Bernard of Clairvaux tried to convert the ceremony into a sacrament, but without success. And it would seem that some effort was made to introduce it into Spain. "In 1530, Wolsey washed, wiped, and kissed the feet of fifty-nine poor men at Peterborough. The practice was continued by English sovereigns till the reign of James II." (Westcott). No traces of it are to be found in the Ambrosian ritual, but the preservation of the custom is found now in the Russian imperial palace, in the ceremonies of the holy week at Rome, and in the palaces of Vienna, Madrid,Munich. The practice was for a time retained by the United Brethren and Mennonites, and the Tunkers of Philadelphia (see 'Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' vol. 1. arts. "Baptism," &sect;&sect; 34, 67, and "Maundy Thursday;" Herzog., 'Encyc.,' art. "Fusswaschung," by H. Merz; and Schaff's 'Herzog.,' art. "Tunkers"). The Church has for the most part looked below the mere form to the real substance of the Lord's teaching, and only thus can we appreciate it adequately. The very injunction would be an inadequate, burdensome one where the feet are covered, and would become impossible and valueless in the Northern and Western world. The service demanded is the self-forgetting ministry of love, which places the interests of self behind and below those of others. Nothing is more theoretically easy and acceptable than this principle, but nothing more difficult of accomplishment. This sentence of our Lord is a noble illustration of the method in which a great principle is made by him the basis of a small duly (cf. Paul's vindication of his own truthfulness and freedom from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17-20</a>; he based it on God's own faithfulness to promise). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
