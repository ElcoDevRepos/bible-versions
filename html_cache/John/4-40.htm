They worshiped on Mount Gerizim rather than in Jerusalem, leading to significant tension and animosity between the two groups. The fact that the Samaritans came to Jesus indicates a breaking down of these barriers, highlighting the universal reach of Jesus' ministry. This moment is significant as it shows the inclusivity of the Gospel, foreshadowing the later mission to the Gentiles.<p><b>they asked Him to stay with them</b><br>The Samaritans' request for Jesus to stay demonstrates their openness and eagerness to learn from Him. This is a remarkable shift from the typical Jewish-Samaritan relations, where Jews often avoided any interaction with Samaritans. Their invitation reflects a recognition of Jesus' authority and a desire for deeper understanding, contrasting with the rejection He often faced from His own people. This moment can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><b>and He stayed two days</b><br>Jesus' willingness to stay with the Samaritans for two days underscores His mission to break down social and ethnic barriers. His actions here prefigure the Great Commission, where the Gospel is to be preached to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The two days symbolize a period of teaching and revelation, during which many Samaritans came to believe in Him. This stay is a testament to Jesus' love and acceptance of all people, regardless of their background, and serves as a model for Christian outreach and fellowship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is engaging with the Samaritans in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritans.htm">Samaritans</a></b><br>Inhabitants of Samaria, a group often at odds with the Jews due to historical and religious differences.

There were some who besought him to depart from them, others who stoned him, Herodians and Pharisees who plotted to destroy him. But these hated Samaritans yearned for more of his fellowship, more of his words and searching glance, more of the Word of life.
