Throughout the Gospels, Jesus often answers questions with profound insights, revealing His divine wisdom and authority.<p><b>My kingdom is not of this world</b><br>Jesus distinguishes His kingdom from earthly political systems. His kingdom is spiritual, transcending worldly power and authority. This aligns with prophecies like <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, which speaks of a divine kingdom that will never be destroyed. It emphasizes the eternal and heavenly nature of Christ's reign, contrasting with temporal earthly kingdoms.<p><b>if it were, My servants would fight to prevent My arrest by the Jews</b><br>Here, Jesus underscores the non-violent nature of His mission. Unlike earthly kingdoms that rely on military power, His kingdom advances through spiritual means. This reflects His earlier teachings, such as in <a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>, where He advocates for turning the other cheek. The mention of "the Jews" refers to the religious leaders who opposed Him, not the Jewish people as a whole.<p><b>But now My kingdom is not of this realm</b><br>The repetition of the kingdom's otherworldly nature reinforces its spiritual essence. "Now" suggests a present reality, indicating that while His kingdom is not currently manifested in a physical form, it is active and present in the hearts of believers. This anticipates the future fulfillment of His kingdom on earth, as seen in <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to Pontius Pilate during His trial.

So far as Christ is King, his royal power and state are not furnished by earthly force, or fleshly ordinances, or physical energies, or material wealth, or imperial armies. The dominion that he will wield will be one over hearts and lives; the authority of the Lord Jesus cannot be arrested or overpowered by physical force. Most commentators justly regard this as a spiritual manifesto of the sources and quality of the kingdom of Christ, and a foreshadowing of the separation between the spiritual and secular power - a declaration that all effort to embody Christian laws and government in compulsory forms, and to defend them by penal sanctions and temporal force, is disloyalty to the royal rank and crown rights of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hengstenberg regards the assertion as precisely the reverse; sees in the passage, "rightly understood, the very opposite purpose. The kingdom that sprang directly from heaven must have absolute authority over all the earth, and it will not submit to be put into obscurity. The kingdoms of this world must become the kingdom of the Lord and his Anointed, and he shall reign for ever and ever." This is true, but not along the lines or with the machinery of earthly rule and authority. The influence and authority of Heaven works upon the spirit by truth and righteousness and peace, and thus transforms institutions, permeates society from the ground of the heart, modifies the relations between the members of a household, and transfigures those between a ruler and his subjects, between the master and his slaves, between labor and capital, and between man and man. Whenever it is triumphant, whenever the lives of kings and their peoples are sanctified by supreme obedience to Christ the King, then war will be impossible, all tyrannies and slaveries will be abolished, all malice and violence of monarchs or mobs will be at an end; then the wolfish and the lamblike nature will be at peace. Then all the means for enforcing the will of one against another will be done away. He will have put down all rule, authority, and power; for <span class="accented">he</span> must reign, and he alone. This kingdom is not (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) "from," "out of," this world's methods or resources; does not begin from without and establish itself, or propagate or preserve itself, from the world, which is a rival, and is not to be coerced but drawn to itself. Like the individual disciple, the kingdom may be in the world, but not <span class="accented">of</span> it. Christ proceeded, <span class="cmt_word">If the kingdom that is mine were from this world,</span> which it is not (mark the form of the condition), then, on that Supposition, <span class="cmt_word">would the servants</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, generally translated "officers") <span class="cmt_word">that are mine fight</span>, with physical force, <span class="cmt_word">in order that I should not be delivered up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to the Jews</span>. The supposition that the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of whom our Lord spoke were "the angels" (as Bengel, Lampe, Stier, and at one time Luthardt, imagined), is distinctly repudiated by the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "<span class="accented">of</span> this present world." If it were the case, as it is not, then would my officers be, not a handful of disciples (whom he generally calls <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), but the servants who would be appropriate to my royal mission, <span class="accented">- then would my servants</span> be busily fighting that I should not be delivered up by the Roman power that is for the moment thrown over me like a shield, to the Jews, who are thirsting for my blood. The loud cry of hatred and vengeance may even at this moment have pierced the interior of the Praetorium, thus giving its force, if not form, to the sentence. Godet thinks our Lord was referring to the crowds who actually gathered round him on Palm Sunday, and not to hypothetical <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; but the force of the condition goes down deeper, and, moreover, such language might have awakened the suspicion that, after all, Jesus <span class="accented">had</span> a political following, if he should choose to evoke it. Observe that this entire severance between "the Jews" and the friends of Christ, which, though occasionally adopted by the evangelist, is not the customary method of our Lord. The moment at which the Savior speaks gives great significance to the phraseology (observe <a href="/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>; <a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>; the only other occasions on which the Lord used this phrase to denote his own people). <span class="cmt_word">But now</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a> and John 15:22, is logical, not temporal); <span class="accented">i.e. But seeing that it is so - <span class="cmt_word"></span>my kingdom</span>, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">is not from hence</span>.
