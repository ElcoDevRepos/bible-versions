This highlights the intimate relationship between Jesus and His disciples, who have been with Him throughout His ministry. The context is the Last Supper, where Jesus is preparing His disciples for His impending crucifixion and departure. This prayer is part of what is known as the High Priestly Prayer, where Jesus intercedes for His followers. Theologically, this demonstrates Jesus' role as an intercessor, a theme that is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>, where Jesus is described as always living to intercede for those who come to God through Him.<p><b>but also on behalf of those who will believe in Me through their message</b><br>Here, Jesus extends His prayer beyond the immediate circle of His disciples to include future believers. This shows the forward-looking nature of Jesus' mission and the universal scope of the Gospel. The phrase "those who will believe" indicates the continuity and expansion of the Christian faith through the ages, beginning with the apostolic witness. The "message" refers to the Gospel, which the apostles would preach, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where the early church devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching. This also connects to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, ensuring the spread of the Gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prayer, Jesus is interceding for His disciples and future believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' prayer, representing the first generation of believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/future_believers.htm">Future Believers</a></b><br>Those who will come to faith through the message of the disciples, including all Christians throughout history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The likely setting of this prayer, part of Jesus' farewell discourse before His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_message.htm">The Message</a></b><br>The Gospel message that the disciples will spread, leading others to believe in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/intercessory_prayer.htm">Intercessory Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus models the importance of praying for others, including those who will come to faith in the future.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_gospel_message.htm">The Power of the Gospel Message</a></b><br>The message of the disciples is powerful and transformative, leading to the salvation of countless believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_among_believers.htm">Unity Among Believers</a></b><br>Jesus' prayer emphasizes the need for unity among Christians, which serves as a powerful witness to the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_discipleship.htm">The Role of Discipleship</a></b><br>Believers are called to share the Gospel, continuing the work of the original disciples and fulfilling Jesus' prayer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_across_generations.htm">Faith Across Generations</a></b><br>The faith of future believers is connected to the faithfulness of those who share the Gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_17_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 17:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Promote_unity_as_Jesus_prayed_in_John_17.htm">How can we promote unity as Jesus prayed in John 17:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_evangelism_today.htm">What does "believe in Me through their message" mean for evangelism today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_17_20_to_Matthew_28_19-20.htm">How does John 17:20 connect with the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_our_church_show_Jesus_unity.htm">In what ways can our church reflect the unity Jesus desires in John 17:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_17_20_Pray_for_future_believers.htm">How does John 17:20 encourage us to pray for future believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_17_20_Unity_s_importance.htm">How does John 17:20 emphasize the importance of unity among believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_17_20_Jesus_vision_for_believers.htm">What does John 17:20 reveal about Jesus' vision for future believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_17_20_and_Church_unity_link.htm">How does John 17:20 connect to the concept of the Church as one body?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_17.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_can_believers_unite_to_glorify_god.htm">How can believers be united and glorify God together?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_the_bible_unify_diversity.htm">How does the Bible promote unity in diversity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_being_one_with_christ_mean.htm">What does being one with Christ mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_unity.htm">What does the Bible say about Christian unity?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 17:20 Mean</div><b>I am not asking on behalf of them alone</b><p>Jesus has just spent the earlier part of His prayer interceding for the Eleven (<a href="/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6-19</a>).

As we have again and again found in these chapters, the future of the Church is so immediately in our Lord's thoughts that it is spoken of as actually present. "Their word" is their witness concerning Him through which men should believe (<a href="/john/15-27.htm" title="And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.">John 15:27</a>). He had manifested the nature of God to them; and they who had received His word and witnessed His work would become, by the indwelling of the Spirit in them, the means of extending this revelation of God to others. They would do this by means of the word which, in His name, they would preach.
