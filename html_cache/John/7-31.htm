Despite the skepticism of some, many were convinced by His teachings and miracles. This belief is significant as it shows the impact of Jesus' ministry on the common people, contrasting with the religious leaders' opposition. The crowd's belief fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being revealed to those who are open-hearted.<p><b>and said, &#8220;When the Christ comes,</b><br>The use of "the Christ" indicates the expectation of a Messiah, a central hope in Jewish eschatology. The crowd's statement reflects their anticipation of a deliverer who would fulfill Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. This expectation was deeply rooted in Jewish culture and history, as they awaited a figure who would restore Israel and bring peace.<p><b>will He perform more signs than this man?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the recognition of Jesus' miraculous works, which were seen as evidence of His divine authority. The signs, including healings and other miracles, were meant to authenticate His claim as the Messiah. The crowd's question implies that Jesus' works were unparalleled, aligning with passages like <a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>, which emphasize the purpose of Jesus' signs as leading to belief in Him as the Christ. The comparison to the expected Messiah suggests that Jesus' actions were already fulfilling messianic expectations, challenging the people to reconsider their understanding of the Messiah's identity and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose miraculous signs and teachings are causing division among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A diverse group of people present in Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles, some of whom are beginning to believe in Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival during which this event takes place, symbolizing God's provision and presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees_and_religious_leaders.htm">The Pharisees and Religious Leaders</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the backdrop of opposition to Jesus, influencing the crowd's perception.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_miracles.htm">Signs and Miracles</a></b><br>The miraculous works performed by Jesus, which are a point of contention and belief among the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_belief.htm">The Nature of Belief</a></b><br>True belief in Jesus goes beyond witnessing miracles;

We cannot say that the whole was cleared up to them, but it was an acceptance by them to some extent of his Messianic claims. He was more than a mere Prophet to them, or Leader, as is obvious from the tone of the speech which follows: <span class="cmt_word">And they said</span> (were saying to one another), while others, perhaps, so soon as they had taken his side, began to urge his claims on those that doubted - <span class="cmt_word">When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than</span> <span class="cmt_word">those</span> <span class="cmt_word">which this Man hath done?</span> The omission of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> makes the question refer to the entire group of signs which had been already performed, and not confine itself to the proceedings of Jesus in Jerusalem. They expected Messiah to give proof of his Divine commission (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4, 5, 20-25</a>). Has not Jesus satisfied all reasonable claims? The question was like fire in touchwood. A conflagration might at any moment burst from the excitable throng which no decision of the Sanhedrin could repress. Something must at once be done to allay the excitement. In the crowd which was pressing the claims of Jesus were many Pharisees, an immensely larger element in the population than the chief priests, and therefore more likely at once to bring such information to the central religious authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Many</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(polloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4183.htm">Strong's 4183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many; often. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(Ek)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
