The "morsel" refers to a piece of bread, which Jesus dipped and gave to Judas as a sign of the betrayer. In the cultural context of a Jewish meal, sharing a morsel was a gesture of friendship and honor, highlighting the gravity of Judas's impending betrayal. This act fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where David laments betrayal by a close friend. The act of taking the morsel signifies Judas's final decision to betray Jesus, despite the intimate setting and Jesus's earlier warnings.<p><b>Satan entered into him</b><br>This phrase indicates a significant spiritual event. It suggests that Judas's decision to betray Jesus was not merely a human choice but was influenced by a direct satanic intervention. This aligns with earlier Gospel accounts where Satan is depicted as an adversary to Jesus's mission (e.g., the temptation in the wilderness). Theologically, this moment underscores the spiritual battle between good and evil, with Judas becoming a tool for Satan's purposes. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of human susceptibility to evil when one turns away from God.<p><b>Then Jesus said to Judas</b><br>Jesus's direct address to Judas demonstrates His foreknowledge and control over the events leading to His crucifixion. Despite knowing Judas's intentions, Jesus remains composed and authoritative. This interaction highlights Jesus's divine nature and His willingness to fulfill His redemptive mission. It also serves as a final opportunity for Judas to reconsider his actions, showcasing Jesus's grace even in the face of betrayal.<p><b>&#8220;What you are about to do, do quickly.&#8221;</b><br>This command from Jesus is both a release and a directive. It indicates Jesus's acceptance of the Father's will and the necessity of the events that are about to unfold. The urgency in Jesus's words reflects the imminent fulfillment of His sacrificial role as the Lamb of God. This phrase also connects to the theme of divine timing found throughout Scripture, where God's plans unfold precisely as intended. Jesus's instruction to act quickly underscores the inevitability of His path to the cross, a central element of Christian salvation history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is having the Last Supper with His disciples.

Judas, having already resolved to betray Jesus, accepts a gesture of friendship, giving Satan fresh access to his heart. Jesus, fully aware, commands the traitor to act without delay, steering history toward the cross. The verse reminds believers that Christ reigns even when evil seems to advance, and that yielding to sin opens the door to deeper spiritual bondage, while submission to Jesus aligns us with God&#8217;s saving purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">And after the sop Satan entered into him.</span>--The Greek expresses more vividly the very moment when the mind finally cast out love, and left itself as a possession for Satan. "And after the sop, <span class= "ital">then</span> Satan entered into him." It was at that moment, when the last effort had been tried, and tried in vain, when the heart hardened itself to receive from Jesus the sacred pledge of love, while it was plotting in black hatred how to betray Him; it was then that hope took her flight from a realm of gloom where she could no longer dwell, and light ceased to shine in a darkness that would not comprehend it.<p><span class= "bld">Then said Jesus unto him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Jesus therefore said unto him.</span> It was because He read the secrets of the heart, and saw that it was wholly given up to evil that He said it.<p><span class= "bld">That thou doest, do quickly.</span>--The Greek is exactly, <span class= "ital">more quickly.</span> "Carry out your plans even more quickly than you have proposed.

By no magical or demoniacal rite was the man rendered the slave of Satan; <span class="accented">post hoc</span> is not <span class="accented">propter hoc</span>.

How could this be known? The evangelist clearly saw what he thus described - he saw the malign and unrelenting expression on Judas's face; he suspected that some devilish plot was hatched, some hideous purpose finally formed. It is the evangelist's way of saying what he personally saw and afterwards concluded. Up to that moment of supreme forbearance, the character was not irretrievably damned, but <span class="accented">now</span> he had sinned against knowledge and love, and even Jesus gives him up. "It were better for him that he had never been born." There is no more awful or tragic touch in the whole narrative, nor any more symbolic of the curse which the corrupt heart can make and bring down upon itself out of the greatest blessing. There is no advantage in trying to determine the amount of figurative sense conveyed by the expression, "Satan entered." The ethical state consequent either upon the sop or the devil is clear enough. The moment when it was induced is signalized in this tragedy. The vehement effort which the traitor must have made to resist all gracious influences opened the way for the powers of hell and darkness to take possession of him. He strengthened himself to do evil. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said to him, That thou doest, do quickly.</span> Questions have been raised as to the sentence - whether it was a solemn command or a permission at once to carry out the purpose that was in his heart (as Grotius, Kuinoel, and others suppose); but Meyer here is more penetrative (so Moulton): "Jesus (as a man) actually wishes to surmount as soon as possible the last crisis of his fate now determined for him." Jameson ('Profound Problems in Theology and Philosophy') urges that it was the prolongation of the struggle which was the bitterest element in Christ's sufferings. The decision at which he had arrived brooked no longer delay. As if he had said, "If you have any manhood in you, and you are not altogether incarnate daemon, make haste, let me remain no longer in suspense; carry out the purpose now and at once." Ambrose, Lucke, Tholuck, suggest that he meant to separate Judas from the eleven, and be rid of his presence. His removal from the group is undoubtedly the condition of our Lord's highest revelations of himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[And when Judas had taken]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
