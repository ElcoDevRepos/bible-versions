The whispering indicates a mix of curiosity and fear, as open discussion about Jesus was risky due to the religious leaders' opposition. This reflects the divided opinions and the secretive nature of discussions about Jesus at the time. The whispering also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as being despised and rejected by men.<p><b>Some said, &#8220;He is a good man.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects the view of those who saw Jesus' miracles and teachings as positive and beneficial. They recognized His moral integrity and compassion, aligning with the portrayal of Jesus as a righteous teacher. This perspective is consistent with the accounts of Jesus' life, where He healed the sick, fed the hungry, and taught with authority, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5-7</a> (the Sermon on the Mount).<p><b>But others replied, &#8220;No, He deceives the people.&#8221;</b><br>This accusation echoes the skepticism and hostility from the religious authorities who saw Jesus as a threat to their power and traditions. The charge of deception is significant, as it implies leading people away from the truth, a serious accusation in Jewish culture. This division among the people is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, where the stone the builders rejected becomes the cornerstone.

Among these multitudes there arose, as before among the Jews and among the disciples (<a href="/john/6-41.htm" title="The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.">John 6:41</a>; <a href="/john/6-61.htm" title="When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Does this offend you?">John 6:61</a>), a murmuring; but the subject of this discussion is not His teaching, but His character.
