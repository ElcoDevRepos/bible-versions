The use of "I know" underscores Jesus' divine insight and intimate relationship with the Father. The "command" refers to the divine instructions and teachings given by God, which are consistent with the message of salvation throughout the Bible. In the context of the Gospel of John, eternal life is a central theme, often associated with belief in Jesus as the Son of God (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). The concept of eternal life is not just a future promise but a present reality for believers, signifying a quality of life that begins with faith in Christ. This assurance of eternal life is rooted in the Old Testament promises of a new covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>) and is fulfilled in Jesus, who is the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>So I speak exactly what the Father has told Me to say.</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' obedience and submission to the Father's will, a recurring theme in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>, <a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>). Jesus' words are not His own but are given by the Father, indicating the unity and co-operation within the Trinity. This obedience is a model for believers, reflecting the call to live in accordance with God's will. The phrase also underscores the prophetic role of Jesus, as He speaks the words of God, similar to the prophets of the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages to the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>). Jesus' teachings are thus authoritative and trustworthy, providing guidance and truth for those who follow Him. This connection to the Father&#8217;s words fulfills the messianic prophecies and establishes Jesus as the ultimate revelation of God to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking about His divine mission and the authority of His words, which come directly from God the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The source of the command that Jesus refers to, emphasizing the divine origin and authority of Jesus' teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>The ultimate promise and result of following God's command, highlighting the spiritual and everlasting nature of Jesus' message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, Jesus is addressing both His disciples and the broader group of listeners, including Jewish leaders and the general public.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The location where Jesus is speaking, during the time leading up to His crucifixion, adding urgency and significance to His words.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_of_jesus'_words.htm">Divine Authority of Jesus' Words</a></b><br>Jesus' teachings are not merely human wisdom but are divinely ordained.
