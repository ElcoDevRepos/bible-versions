The sea is situated in a basin surrounded by hills, which can cause sudden and violent storms. This natural phenomenon is significant in biblical narratives, as it often symbolizes chaos and the challenges of life. In the Old Testament, wind is sometimes used as a metaphor for God's power and presence (e.g., <a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>, where God uses a strong east wind to part the Red Sea). The disciples' experience with the strong wind can be seen as a test of faith, echoing other biblical instances where God's people face trials.<p><b>and the sea grew agitated</b><br>The agitation of the sea is a literal description of the stormy conditions but also carries symbolic meaning. In biblical literature, the sea often represents chaos and danger. In <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, the Spirit of God hovers over the waters, bringing order out of chaos. Similarly, in the New Testament, Jesus' authority over the sea (as seen in His calming of the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) demonstrates His divine power over creation. The agitated sea in <a href="/john/6-18.htm">John 6:18</a> sets the stage for Jesus' miraculous act of walking on water, further affirming His identity as the Son of God who has dominion over the natural world. This event also prefigures the peace and order that Christ brings into the lives of believers amidst life's storms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Jesus is central to the account of <a href="/bsb/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.

Matthew corroborates: &#8220;the boat was already far from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-24.htm">Matthew 14:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture the Lord often allows natural forces to highlight human helplessness and His own supremacy: &#8220;The LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea&#8221; in <a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>, and &#8220;He makes the winds His messengers&#8221; in <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>.<p>&#8226; For the disciples the sudden storm becomes a divinely ordained classroom. Mark notes that Jesus &#8220;saw the disciples straining at the oars&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-48.htm">Mark 6:48</a>), underscoring that He is never unaware of His people&#8217;s distress even when unseen.<p>&#8226; This phrase reminds believers that following Christ does not guarantee calm seas, yet every wind remains under His sovereignty (<a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sea grew agitated</b><p>&#8226; The surface of the lake responds to the wind, rising into white-capped waves. The agitation is not merely atmospheric; it reflects creation&#8217;s groaning under the weight of the Fall (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often links churning waters with chaos and fear. <a href="/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25</a> recounts, &#8220;He spoke and raised a tempest that lifted the waves of the sea,&#8221; while verse 29 records the Lord&#8217;s mastery: &#8220;He calmed the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For the disciples, the swelling sea magnifies their vulnerability, preparing them to behold Jesus walking on the very waves that threaten them (<a href="/john/6-19.htm">John 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows the ultimate calming of all turmoil in Christ&#8217;s presence: <a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a> anticipates the day when &#8220;there was no longer any sea,&#8221; symbolizing the end of chaos and danger for God&#8217;s people.<p>&#8226; Believers today can identify with waters that &#8220;grew agitated&#8221;&#8212;financial strain, relational conflict, cultural upheaval&#8212;yet the passage urges confidence that the Lord strides over every surge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/6-18.htm">John 6:18</a> describes a real, forceful wind and a storm-tossed sea, setting the stage for Jesus to reveal His authority over nature.
