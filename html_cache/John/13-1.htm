This event is central to Jewish identity and religious practice, involving the sacrifice of a lamb and the eating of unleavened bread. The timing of this event in the Gospel of John highlights the connection between Jesus as the Lamb of God and the sacrificial lamb of Passover. The setting underscores the impending sacrifice of Jesus, aligning with the prophetic symbolism of the Passover lamb.<p><b>and Jesus knew that His hour had come</b><br>The "hour" refers to the appointed time for Jesus' crucifixion, resurrection, and glorification. Throughout the Gospel of John, Jesus speaks of His "hour" as a divinely appointed time (<a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4, 7</a>:30, 12:23). This moment marks the culmination of His earthly ministry and the fulfillment of His mission to redeem humanity. It signifies a transition from His public ministry to the passion narrative.<p><b>to leave this world and return to the Father</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' awareness of His impending death, resurrection, and ascension. "Leaving this world" refers to His physical departure through death, while "return to the Father" emphasizes His divine origin and destination. It reflects the intimate relationship between Jesus and the Father, a recurring theme in John's Gospel (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1, 17</a>:5). This return signifies the completion of His earthly mission and the restoration of His pre-incarnate glory.<p><b>Having loved His own who were in the world</b><br>"His own" refers to Jesus' disciples and, by extension, all believers. This phrase highlights the special relationship and commitment Jesus has to those who follow Him. The love mentioned here is agape love, characterized by selflessness and sacrifice. This love is demonstrated throughout Jesus' ministry and is about to be exemplified in the ultimate act of sacrifice on the cross. The phrase also contrasts the spiritual realm ("His own") with the physical world, emphasizing the believers' place in a world that often opposes them.<p><b>He loved them to the very end</b><br>This phrase underscores the completeness and perseverance of Jesus' love. "To the very end" can be understood both temporally and qualitatively, indicating that Jesus' love extends to the end of His earthly life and is perfect in its nature. This love is demonstrated in the subsequent chapters through acts of service, teaching, and ultimately, His sacrificial death. It fulfills the prophetic and typological roles of the suffering servant (Isaiah 53) and the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), who lays down His life for the sheep.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is aware of His impending crucifixion and departure from the world.

This supplies a chronological note, which is not exhausted by the mysterious and pathetic act which is described, but embraces the entire communion of soul with his disciples, and with the Father in their presence, detailed in <a href="/john/13.htm">John 13-17</a>. Commentators have differed greatly as to the reference of this phrase - whether to the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, as Kling and Luthardt, or to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as Wieseler and Tholuck; both these interpretations limit the meaning of the passage. Christ's knowledge that his hour was come was not kept from him till that moment, nor was his love to his own disciples limited or qualified by the advent of the Passover. It is far better, with Westcott, Coder, Meyer, and Lange, to take the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, with the principal verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. This becomes mere obvious if <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> be taken, as it generally is taken, in Greek, to mean "unto the uttermost," "absolutely" "perfectly." Godet and Lucke add to the idea of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> here the <span class="accented">manifestation</span>, or <span class="accented">proof</span>, of the intensity and tenderness of the Divine love. Meyer doubts this signification of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>. The whole of the intervening sentence is in apposition with the subject of the sentence. The evangelist was eye-withes of the manner and look of his Lord, and ventured to say what was passing in his mind. He was justified by what followed, and threw back into the spirit of this strange and solemn action the account which the Lord afterwards gave of himself. Throughout the whole passage we detect; the extraordinary blending of Divine and human of which John was the witness. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus knowing</span> (as he did know) <span class="cmt_word">that the hour was</span> <span class="cmt_word">come</span> - an hour for which he had been long waiting, and to which frequent reference has been made. The crisis has arrived, the breach with the authorities was final, the disciples themselves were trembling in doubt, the great law had been uttered, the glorification of the Son of man must now be accomplished by departure rather than by longer ministry, by death rather than by universal acclaim - <span class="cmt_word">that</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> here notes the Divine purpose, or what is not infrequently introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "the contemplated result" (see Canon Evans on "the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament," <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 3, 2nd series) - <span class="cmt_word">he</span>, Jesus, the Son of man, <span class="cmt_word">should depart out of this world</span> (this is one theme of the following discourse, one of its key-notes, <a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>; <a href="/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>; <a href="/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>, and many other passages) unto the Father. If so, death was not an ending of life, but a departure to the Father - a coming into closer and more intimate relations and communion with the Father than was possible, even for him, in this sinful and evil world. Frequently the demonstrative pronoun is used to designate this transitory, perilous, sad state of being. Further, Jesus <span class="cmt_word">having loved his own</span>, his very own, whom the Father had given him, <span class="cmt_word">who were</span> and would continue <span class="cmt_word">in the world</span>, and have tribulation there (see <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>; <a href="/john/16-1.htm">John 16:1-4, 33</a>; <a href="/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11, 14, 18</a>), and all the more so because of his departure and the cessation of his earthly manifestation and ministry. Here the sentence ends with the climacteric expression, <span class="cmt_word">He loved them utterly</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he manifested, and that before the Paschal Lamb should be slain for them, his absolute, extreme, unutterable love. Archdeacon Watkins has made an interesting suggestion, that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> represents, in Greek, the Hebrew idiom of the repetition of the action of the verb; whereas the LXX. often presents this Hebraism in literal Greek, as <a href="/genesis/20-17.htm">Genesis 20:17</a>, yet in <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a> a similar reduplication is Grecized by the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and that what St. John, a Hebrew writing in Greek, meant by the use of it was simply," He loved them with a fullness of love." This usage is confirmed by <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>, by later Greek and by classical usage. It probably means in <a href="/luke/18-5.htm">Luke 18:5</a> "at last," but not necessarily so even there. Margin of Revised Version gives "to the uttermost." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[It was] now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">just before</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#961;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(Pro)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4253.htm">Strong's 4253: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; 'fore', i.e. In front of, prior to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
