The Sea of Galilee, where this event took place, is known for sudden storms due to its geographical setting. The distance rowed suggests they were far from shore, emphasizing their vulnerability. This setting highlights the disciples' perseverance and the challenging circumstances they faced, which is a recurring theme in their journey with Jesus.<p><b>they saw Jesus approaching the boat</b><br>The disciples witnessing Jesus approaching signifies a miraculous event, as He was walking on water. This act demonstrates His divine authority over nature, reinforcing His identity as the Son of God. The sight of Jesus coming towards them in their time of need is symbolic of His ever-present help and guidance, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>, which speaks of God as a refuge and strength.<p><b>walking on the sea</b><br>Walking on water is a powerful demonstration of Jesus' mastery over creation, fulfilling Old Testament imagery where God alone treads upon the waves (<a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>). This miracle serves as a type of Christ's divine nature, affirming His deity and foreshadowing His ultimate victory over chaos and death. It also prefigures the peace and order He brings into the lives of believers.<p><b>and they were terrified</b><br>The disciples' fear reflects a common human reaction to the divine and the unknown. Their terror underscores their limited understanding of Jesus' true nature at this point in His ministry. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals encounter the divine, such as the fear experienced by Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>.

When they had rowed with a northwest wind, one "contrary to them," about three miles and a half, they would be in the midst of the broadest portion of the lake, and exposed to the force of those gales which often sweep down with astonishing fury upon lakes similarly guarded on all sides by high hills. While the wind was tossing the little lake into angry waves, it was not silent on the mountain side or summit, and Jesus (says Mark) "saw them toiling in rowing." He loved them to the uttermost. Now, Jesus never went out of his way to work a miracle, but he never went out of his way to avoid one. It seems as natural to him to make his will the cause of events as to submit to the arbitrament of circumstances. The miracle, however, was always for the benefit of others, not for his own advantage and comfort. <span class="cmt_word">They beheld Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship</span>. Paulus, Gfrorer, and Baumgarten-Crusius suppose that Jesus was walking "along the shore" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is the phrase used for this movement in <a href="/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16</a>; not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> as here), and that they had miscalculated their distance, and that there was no manifestation of special power on the occasion, nothing less than one of the most ordinary of all coincidences. The three narrators, each in his own manner, convey a profoundly different impression. The discovery of their Lord thus in near proximity would not have made them "cry out for fear," and say (Matthew and Mark), "It is a phantasm," an apparition, a herald of immediate destruction. The loud cry (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) is the especial note of Mark. John simply says, <span class="cmt_word">They were affrighted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). They might have eagerly longed for his presence, remembering his recent display of power when "the winds and sea obeyed him." But when the deliverance came, the manner of it was unexpected, and the symbolism ineffably sublime. They could not have been ignorant of the Psalms which spoke of Jehovah walking on the sea, and mightier than its waves (see also <a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>, "He alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth on the heights of the sea"). This visible nearness to them of the mighty power of God is enough to have startled them into cries of fear; but it is quite incompatible with the rationalistic interpretation of the event. Matthew and Mark both relate that the Lord came to them at or about the fourth watch (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. between three and six a.m.), when the first gleams of light were breaking over the eastern hills. Consequently, their peril had been prolonged and perplexing. The whole of the narrative lends itself to symbol, and suggests the impressive analogy of the calamities to which the ship of God's Church has been exposed in its long history. Often has the Church been chastised for its secular tastes and worldly passions, buffeted with the storms of the world and tormented by the waves; but in the direst extremity it has seen the deliverer approach, and at first cried out for fear, trembling at his nearness. Individual believers have often seen, in this picture of the storm and the Saviour, an <span class="accented">image</span> of the sore travail and victory of their faith. The disposition on the part of numerous expositors to press these analogies has strengthened the hands of the critical and rationalistic expositors. We can grant that the idea which is so fertile is more important than the narrative <span class="accented">per se</span>, but apart from the historic fact itself, who can say that the idea would ever have dawned on human minds? We make no further attempt to think out the <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> of the miracle, nor can we with that view accept the <span class="accented">docetic</span> conception of the body of Christ, which some have attributed most unfairly to John's Gospel. It is enough that the will of Christ thus faced the forces of nature, and prophesied the ultimate victory which the will of glorified humanity will likewise win. The great <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span> of Christ include his power over nature, in its physical elements and forces, in the regions of both animal and vegetable life, over human nature, diseased, crippled, devil ridden, and dead.
