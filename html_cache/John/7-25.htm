Jerusalem, being the religious and cultural center of Judaism, was a place where news and rumors spread quickly. The people of Jerusalem would have been more aware of the local religious leaders' intentions and discussions. This setting is significant as it highlights the tension between Jesus and the Jewish authorities. The phrase "began to say" suggests a growing awareness or realization among the people, indicating that Jesus' actions and teachings were causing a stir in the city.<p><b>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the man they are trying to kill?</b><br>This question reveals the underlying hostility and threat against Jesus from the Jewish leaders. The reference to "the man they are trying to kill" points to the growing plot against Jesus, which is rooted in earlier chapters where the religious leaders sought to arrest Him due to His claims and actions, such as healing on the Sabbath (<a href="/john/5-16.htm">John 5:16-18</a>). This phrase also underscores the public knowledge of the leaders' intentions, suggesting that the conflict between Jesus and the authorities was not a secret. It reflects the fulfillment of prophetic themes where the Messiah would face opposition and rejection, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The question also highlights the irony and tension in the narrative, as Jesus, the source of life, is being targeted for death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_jerusalem.htm">People of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The local residents of Jerusalem who are aware of the tensions surrounding Jesus and the religious leaders' intentions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, whose teachings and actions have caused division and controversy among the people and religious authorities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/religious_leaders.htm">Religious Leaders</a></b><br>The Jewish authorities who are plotting against Jesus due to His growing influence and His challenges to their authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, significant as the religious and cultural center of Jewish life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>The context of this chapter, a major Jewish festival during which Jesus is teaching in the temple courts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_opposition.htm">Awareness of Opposition</a></b><br>Recognize that following Christ may lead to opposition or misunderstanding from others, as seen in the life of Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_truth.htm">Courage in Truth</a></b><br>Jesus continued to speak truth despite the threat to His life.
