It reflects the religious leaders' concern about John's identity and authority. In the context of first-century Judea, many were anticipating the arrival of the Messiah, and John's ministry of baptism and repentance had stirred significant interest. The question echoes the broader theme of identity and authority found throughout the Gospel of John, where Jesus' identity is progressively revealed.<p><b>We need an answer for those who sent us.</b><br>The religious leaders were under pressure to report back to the Sanhedrin, the ruling council in Jerusalem. This reflects the hierarchical structure of Jewish religious authority at the time, where the Sanhedrin held significant power and influence. The need for an answer underscores the urgency and importance of John's activities, which were seen as potentially messianic or prophetic, thus requiring official scrutiny.<p><b>What do you say about yourself?&#8221;</b><br>This question invites John the Baptist to clarify his role and mission. It highlights the theme of testimony, which is central to the Gospel of John. John the Baptist's response, which follows in the subsequent verses, emphasizes his role as a forerunner to Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. This question also sets the stage for John's declaration of Jesus as the Lamb of God, pointing to the fulfillment of Old Testament sacrificial imagery and messianic prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A key prophetic figure who prepared the way for Jesus Christ.

Their persistence shows official concern from Jerusalem over his ministry in the wilderness, echoing how religious leaders later scrutinize Jesus (<a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a>; <a href="/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>). Because every word of Scripture is accurate and purposeful, this opening phrase reminds us:<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s preaching drew attention that could not be ignored, much like Elijah before Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17</a>) and later Paul before Agrippa (<a href="/acts/25-23.htm">Acts 25:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; God often positions faithful witnesses to confront complacent religion with the call to repentance (<a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</b><p>Their blunt question reflects a deep uneasiness. They sense prophetic authority but cannot categorize him. Scripture records similar moments:<p>&#8226; Pharaoh demanded Moses&#8217; credentials (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The Sanhedrin pressed Peter and John, &#8220;By what power or what name did you do this?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-7.htm">Acts 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; own identity would become the central issue of His earthly ministry (<a href="/john/8-25.htm">John 8:25</a>).<p>Because Scripture is literal and true, these encounters highlight the world&#8217;s perennial challenge: dealing with God&#8217;s messengers forces a decision (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We need an answer for those who sent us.</b><p>Their motivation is institutional. They are accountable to the religious hierarchy, not to God&#8217;s revelation through the prophet standing before them. Cross references emphasize this contrast:<p>&#8226; Saul feared the people&#8217;s opinion more than God&#8217;s command (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The healed blind man&#8217;s parents deferred to the authorities &#8220;for fear of the Jews&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, Pilate sought to satisfy the crowd rather than uphold justice (<a href="/mark/15-15.htm">Mark 15:15</a>).<p>These examples underscore how human systems, when untethered from submission to God, value reports over repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What do you say about yourself?</b><p>Having exhausted labels, they invite John to define his own ministry. John&#8217;s forthcoming answer&#8212;&#8220;I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a>, quoting <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>)&#8212;shows Scripture fulfilling Scripture, a literal alignment that bolsters confidence in prophetic accuracy. Related passages reinforce this pattern:<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy framed Cyrus&#8217;s rise long before his birth (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28&#8211;45</a>:1).<p>&#8226; Jesus read <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1&#8211;2</a> and declared, &#8220;Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter pointed to <a href="/bsb/joel/2.htm">Joel 2</a> on Pentecost as a present reality (<a href="/acts/2-16.htm">Acts 2:16</a>).<p>Every time God&#8217;s servants identify themselves by the Word rather than personal ambition, the focus remains on the coming Messiah, not the messenger (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/1-22.htm">John 1:22</a> records a four-fold interrogation that exposes hearts. The delegation&#8217;s need for tidy categories contrasts with John&#8217;s God-given identity rooted in prophecy. Scripture faithfully documents this exchange to show that authentic ministry answers to God&#8217;s Word, not human approval, and that every earnest question about identity ultimately prepares the way for Christ, &#8220;the true Light who gives light to every man&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">That we may give an answer.</span>--He has given the "No" to all the ideas they had formed of him.
