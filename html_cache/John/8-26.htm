The phrase indicates that Jesus possesses comprehensive knowledge and insight into their hearts and actions. This echoes the divine attribute of omniscience, as seen in other scriptures where God knows the thoughts and intentions of individuals (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). The mention of judgment aligns with Jesus' role as the ultimate judge, a theme found throughout the New Testament (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>). His judgment is righteous and based on truth, contrasting with the often hypocritical judgments of the Pharisees.<p><b>But the One who sent Me is truthful,</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to God the Father as the One who sent Him. This emphasizes the divine mission and authority of Jesus, as He is not acting on His own but is sent by God. The truthfulness of God is a foundational attribute, underscoring His reliability and faithfulness (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). This statement also highlights the unity and harmony between the Father and the Son, a recurring theme in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). The truthfulness of God assures that Jesus' teachings and judgments are trustworthy.<p><b>and what I have heard from Him,</b><br>Jesus emphasizes His role as the faithful messenger of God's word. This phrase indicates that His teachings are not self-derived but are directly received from God the Father. It reflects the prophetic tradition where prophets spoke what they heard from God (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). Jesus, as the ultimate prophet, fulfills and surpasses this role, being the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). His teachings are the direct revelation of God's will and truth.<p><b>I tell the world.</b><br>The scope of Jesus' message is universal, intended for all humanity, not just the Jewish people. This reflects the inclusive nature of the Gospel, which is meant for every nation and people (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). Jesus' mission is to reveal God's truth to the entire world, offering salvation and light to all who believe (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). This phrase underscores the global impact of Jesus' ministry and the spread of the Gospel message beyond the confines of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, speaking to the Pharisees and the crowd.

He is about in this discourse to do so again. There are present to His mind now many things to say of them, and these, if said, would be in words of condemnation; but He refrains. There is present to His mind also the great work He had to do--to speak to the world the eternal truth of God.<p><span class= "bld">But he that sent me is true.</span>--The words express a marked contrast to the words and thoughts with which He would come in contact, if He said and judged concerning them.
