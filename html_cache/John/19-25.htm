The location, Golgotha, is outside the city walls of Jerusalem, a place of execution, emphasizing the shame and suffering Jesus endured.<p><b>and her sister</b><br>The identity of Mary's sister is debated among scholars.

The question cannot be answered with certainty; but upon the whole, the balance of evidence inclines to the view that we have four persons here mentioned in two pairs: "His mother and His mother's sister; Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene." As early as the second century, the Peshito Syriac version adopted this view, and inserted "and" after the word sister. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/matthew/28-1.htm" title="In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.">Matthew 28:1</a> and <a href="/luke/24-18.htm" title="And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?">Luke 24:18</a>, and especially the <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> on <span class= "ital">The brethren of the Lord</span> in Lightfoot <span class= "ital">On Galatians,</span> pp. 247-282.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there were standing by the cross of Jesus.</span> Matthew says (Matthew 28:55; <a href="/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40, 41</a>) that many women stood afar off beholding these things, and amongst them Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James (the less, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the son of Alphaeus) and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children, expressly identified here as elsewhere with Salerno, "women who followed him from Galilee" (<a href="/luke/23-55.htm">Luke 23:55</a>), and ministered unto him. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> of this verse implies that, in the courage of their love and tenderness, they had drawn nearer to the cross, led on as it would seem by <span class="cmt_word">his mother herself</span>, whom John with fuller knowledge mentions as the most important member of one group. John adds, and the sister of his mother, then (it must be admitted without any conjunctive <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) he adds, <span class="cmt_word">Mary</span> <span class="cmt_word">the</span> (wife) <span class="cmt_word">of Clopas, and Mary Magdalen</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> is by almost all admitted to be identifiable with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, Alphaeus, of <a href="/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>. Consequently, "the Mary (of Clopos)" is none other than the mother of James the less-known disciple, as well as of others. And this second Mary is identically the same as the Mary spoken of in Matthew and Mark by slightly different phraseology. The question arises - Does John here speak, then, of four women? or does he say that this Mary was the sister of the Virgin Mary? If "Mary the wife of Clopas" be the sister of the Virgin, then James the less, Joses, and others are cousins of our Lord. This hypothesis has been used by those who identify these men with the "brethren of the Lord;" but it is rendered improbable by the fact referred to twice over in the synoptists and John, that his "brethren did not believe in him," and the growing certainty that "James the brother of our Lord" was not "James the less." Moreover, it is improbable that two sisters should have the same name. The other supposition is that the third woman mentioned by the synoptists (namely, Salome, the mother of Zebedee's sons) was the sister of the mother of Jesus. Against this is the non-appearance of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> between the second and third names. This absence may be simply due to the fact that John mentions "two and two," singling them out from "the many women," according to his wont. Against it, Godet and others have urged that we have no other hint of the relationship; but of many similar facts throughout the Gospel we have only the slenderest indications - take, for instance, the identification of Judas (not Iscariot) with Lebbaeus and Thaddseus; Nathanael with Bartholomew - and there is much which makes the identification natural. It is after the manner of John to omit the name of Salerno, as he always does his own throughout the Gospel and Epistles. But the entire narrative from beginning to end is illumined by the fact that John was the near relative of Jesus. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> flashes into light and justification at once. Very much, both in the synoptic and Johannine narratives, receives a deeper meaning. The early friendship, the private ministry of our Lord, with John as his principal companion, the request of Salome, and the exquisite incident which now follows, all receive a richer meaning when it becomes clear that Salome was so nearly related to Jesus. In this conclusion Wieseler, Luthardt, Lange, Westcott, Sears, Moulton, Schaff, and others coincide, though Meyer and Hengstenberg take the other view. Hengstenberg thinks the tradition of three Marys is enough to counterbalance what he calls a learned device! Assuming, then, that John was so dear a friend, so near a relative, we understand better what follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Near</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(para)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3844.htm">Strong's 3844: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gen: from; dat: beside, in the presence of; acc: alongside of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
