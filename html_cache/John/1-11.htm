The Jewish people were chosen by God as His covenant people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> with the call of Abraham. Throughout the Old Testament, God established a unique relationship with Israel, giving them the Law, the prophets, and the promises (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4-5</a>). Jesus' coming to His own fulfills numerous prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which foretold the Messiah's arrival. Geographically, Jesus was born in Bethlehem, raised in Nazareth, and ministered throughout Judea and Galilee, areas central to Jewish life and worship.<p><b>and His own did not receive Him</b><br>Despite the anticipation of a Messiah, many Jewish leaders and people did not accept Jesus as the Christ. This rejection is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus faces opposition from the Pharisees, Sadducees, and other religious authorities (<a href="/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>, <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>). The cultural expectation of a political liberator clashed with Jesus' mission of spiritual salvation and kingdom of God proclamation. This rejection was prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected. Theologically, this rejection highlights the broader human condition of sin and the need for divine intervention, as well as the opening of God's covenant to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a> and <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, Jesus is the Word made flesh who came into the world He created.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_own.htm">His Own</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish people, God's chosen nation, who were expected to recognize and receive their Messiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rejection.htm">Rejection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus being rejected by the very people He came to save, highlighting the tragic irony of His mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_rejection.htm">Understanding Rejection</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus' rejection was part of God's redemptive plan.

Here the question arises - Has no more direct approach been made to our race than that which is common to <span class="accented">every</span> man? Undoubtedly the whole theocratic dispensation would be ignored if this were not the case - and consequently the evangelist continues the recital of the peculiarities and specialties of the approach of the Logos to the human understanding. <span class="cmt_word">He came unto his own possession</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). Here all expositors agree to see the special manifestation of the Logos to the house of Israel, which is called in numerous passages of the Old Testament, God's own possession (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-4.htm">Psalm 135:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And his own</span> (people) <span class="cmt_word">received him not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; <span class="accented">cf.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 4, and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> of ver. 10). Here, again, the most astonishing, direct and prominent illustration of such a statement is seen in the historic ministry of the Lord Jesus, in the terrible record of his rejection by his own people, by his own disciples, by the theocratic chiefs, by the assembled Sanhedrin, by the very populace to whom Pilate appealed to save him from murderous fury. But the significance of the prologue is to my mind missed, if the earlier agelong rejection of the ministry, and light of the Logos, nay, the perpetual and awful treatment which he continually receives from "his own possession," be not perceived. There was a Divine and special sense in which the perpetual coming of the Logos to the world was emphasized by his gracious self-manifestations to the people of Israel. The great Name of Jehovah, the Angel of the presence, the manifestations to Abraham, to Moses, to David, to Elijah, to Isaiah, and Ezekiel; the Shechinah glories, the whole ministry of grace to the house of Israel, was a <span class="accented">perpetual coming to his own</span> peculiar possession; but yet the sum total of their history is a continuous repudiation and lapse. They rejected the Lord, they fell in the wilderness, they were turned unto other gods, they went a-whoring after their own inventions. They knew not that God had healed them. The great things of his Law were accounted strange things to them (compare Stephen's apology for an elaborate exposition of this thought). The same kind of treatment has continually been given by the world, and even by those who have boasted of standing in the special lines of his grace. This suggestion cannot he fully expanded here.
