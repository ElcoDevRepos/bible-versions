In the biblical context, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees, who prided themselves on being descendants of Abraham. However, Jesus challenges their spiritual state, suggesting that their actions and attitudes align more with Satan than with God. This echoes the theme of spiritual parentage found in 1 <a href="/john/3-10.htm">John 3:10</a>, where the children of God and the children of the devil are distinguished by their actions.<p><b>and you want to carry out his desires</b><br>The desires of the devil are contrary to the will of God, characterized by sin, rebellion, and deceit. This phrase highlights the human tendency to follow sinful inclinations, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the fall of man. The Pharisees' desire to kill Jesus (<a href="/john/8-37.htm">John 8:37</a>) aligns with Satan's destructive nature, emphasizing the moral and spiritual conflict between God's truth and Satan's deception.<p><b>He was a murderer from the beginning</b><br>This refers to Satan's role in the fall of humanity, where his deception led to spiritual death (Genesis 3). The term "murderer" underscores the destructive consequences of sin and Satan's influence. It also connects to Cain's murder of Abel (1 <a href="/john/3-12.htm">John 3:12</a>), illustrating how sin leads to physical and spiritual death.<p><b>refusing to uphold the truth</b><br>Satan's nature is fundamentally opposed to truth, as seen in his deception of Eve (<a href="/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4-5</a>). This refusal to uphold truth is a defining characteristic of his rebellion against God. In contrast, Jesus embodies truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), highlighting the stark difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness.<p><b>because there is no truth in him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete absence of truth in Satan's character. Unlike God, who is the source of all truth (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>), Satan's nature is entirely deceitful. This absence of truth is evident in his actions throughout scripture, from the temptation of Adam and Eve to the temptation of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>When he lies, he speaks his native language</b><br>Lying is intrinsic to Satan's nature, as natural to him as speaking one's native tongue. This phrase underscores the habitual and inherent deceitfulness of Satan. It contrasts with the nature of God, who cannot lie (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>), and highlights the importance of truth in the life of a believer (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>).<p><b>because he is a liar and the father of lies</b><br>Satan is not only a liar but the originator of falsehood. This title, "father of lies," indicates his role in introducing deceit into the world. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of spiritual warfare, where truth and lies are in constant conflict. Believers are called to resist Satan's lies by standing firm in the truth of God's word (<a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, addressing the Pharisees and Jewish leaders who were opposing Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>Referred to as the "father" of those who reject the truth, characterized as a murderer and liar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_jewish_leaders.htm">Pharisees and Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience Jesus is addressing, who are accused of aligning with the devil's desires.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beginning.htm">The Beginning</a></b><br>Refers to the time of creation and the fall of man, highlighting the devil's role in introducing sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/truth.htm">Truth</a></b><br>Central theme in this passage, representing God's nature and the opposite of the devil's character.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_enemy.htm">Understanding the Enemy</a></b><br>Recognize the devil's character as a liar and murderer.

The possessive pronoun (your) is not expressed in the Greek, and the form of the sentence is one which would have required it if it were included in the sense. The father who has been referred to in <a href="/john/8-38.htm" title="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.">John 8:38</a>; <a href="/john/8-41.htm" title="You do the deeds of your father.

Nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death into the world, and they that do hold of his side do find it." So St. Paul, "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin" (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>). The Fall was the murder of the human race; and it is in reference to this, of which the fratricide in the first family was a signal result, that the Tempter is called a murderer from the beginning (see Note on <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>). "Cain was of that wicked one, and slew his brother." (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/1_john/3-8.htm" title="He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.">1John 3:8-12</a>, where the thought is expanded.) The reference to the murderer is suggested here by the fact that the Jews had been seeking to kill our Lord (<a href="/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>). They are true to the nature which their father had from the beginning. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are of the father who is the devil.</span> In this way the great bulk of the best commentators translate this difficult clause, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar, and Davidson translate, "You are of the father of the devil;" and suggest that here the evangelist betrays his fierce Gnostic (Ophite) antagonism to the Jews, and adopts the view that the God of the Old Testament, the "Creator," was the Father of the serpent. This is surely untenable. The Creator of all things, in the prologue, is none other than the Father acting through the Logos. In the third, fourth, and fifth chapters, the greatest honours are ascribed to the God of the Jewish people, and not the faintest hint given of such radical divergence from the standpoint of Judaism. In this very passage the father of the faithful Jews is spoken of with profound reverence. "The second-century Gnostic" must have so cleverly concealed his sentiments, and have refuted his position so frequently, that it is inexcusably inept for him to have shown his cloven foot on this occasion. Thoma ignores the wild conjecture of Hilgenfeld. Our Lord was not dealing with the parentage of the devil, but with the moral and religious parentage of those Jews who were manifesting the most bitter antagonism to himself and plotting his destruction. For them to claim spiritual kinship and childlike feeling to the Father whose holy nature and whose love to them he was revealing, was a strange contradiction in terms. Our Lord repudiated it in this terrible language. He had worsted the seductive suggestions of the devil, and when he saw and heard them repeated and set forth as Divine proposals, he gave them their true name. "You disclaim the faintest sympathy with other gods; you resent the bar sinister on your escutcheon; you say that religiously as well as historically you are not born of any fornication - there is no taint in your theological position; but I tell you plainly that <span class="accented">you are from</span>, you are manifesting the very essence and substance of, the father who is the prime enemy of God and man. The phrase is in perfect keeping with many synoptic phrases (<a href="/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>; cf. John the Baptist's language, <a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the lusts of your father</span> - those of falsehood and murder, lying and slaughter, being the top and chief of all his evil passions - <span class="cmt_word">ye are</span> willing, <span class="cmt_word">desirous to do</span>. He has engendered these very lusts within you. The paternity of your angry passions, your incapacity to see and accept my word, are both alike explained. There is no more terrible rebuke in the whole compass of revelation. The disciple whom Jesus loved, in preserving these words, shows very decidedly that he was a "Son of Thunder," and calls down fire from heaven (a very storm) which has been ever since descending upon the heads of these and all other bitter antagonists of the Son of man. <span class="cmt_word">He was a murderer</span> (literally, <span class="accented">a manslayer</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>from the beginning.</span> This has often been referred to the spirit which animated Cain in the slaughter of his brother Abel. There is some corroboration of such a reference in <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>, "Cain was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of that wicked one, and slew his brother;" and in the language of <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>, "Whoso hateth his brother is a murderer." (So Lucke, Reuss, De Wette, and others.) But the narrative of the death of Abel makes no reference to the agency of the devil, but rather indicates that the sin of Cain was originated by his having been begotten in the image of the fallen Adam. The better interpretation and reference of the words may be seen in <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>, "He that doeth sin is from the devil (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), for the devil sinneth from the beginning (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>)." And sin entered into the world through the seduction and false statements of the devil, by which the first man was veritably slain, his moral nature killed outright. Grace was not shut out, but Adam died. In the day that he ate of the forbidden tree, man most surely and in the deepest sense <span class="accented">died.</span> "God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity. Nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of its side do find it" (Wisd. 2:23, 24; <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>); "Sin entered into the world, and death by sin" (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The work of destruction at the beginning of humanity upon earth has never been exhausted. In murderous propensity, in lying and seductive words and ways, the children of wrath are ever showing their parentage. To this statement our Lord added what has by many been regarded as a distinct revelation of the fall of Satan himself from the condition of rectitude (cf. <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He stands not;</span> continues not - in the truth (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the perfect is the better reading, and demands this translation; the rendering of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">stetit</span>, favoured by Augustine, and involving a reference to the <span class="accented">fall of the devil</span>, would have required <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, pluperfect). Jesus (lid not, therefore, explicitly assert anything with reference to the act of original revolt of the devil, but declared that the devil has no place in truth; he restlessly resists, throwing a hopeless, perilous glamour of falsehood round all he touches. Schaff suggests, rightly, that the combination of this statement with that of the prologue (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>) <span class="accented">presupposes</span> the fall of this mighty and murderous spirit from a previous condition of rectitude, and the dictum of our Lord ought never to have been charged with the admission of an eternal principle of evil. The fall of the lost angels is not explicitly stated. <span class="cmt_word">Because there is no truth in him.</span> The absence of the article before "truth" shows that in the previous clause the objective truth is meant, that the reality of things as known by him is referred to. The truth was that region or sphere of action in which he elected not to stand, and, as a matter of fact, does not stand nor find place. By "truth" is meant subjective truth or "truthfulness," the spirit which repudiates falsehood in all its forms and manifestations. There is no consistency with himself, no inward harmony with reality. This is given as reason why the devil stands not in <span class="accented">the</span> truth. <span class="cmt_word">Whensoever</span> <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">speaketh a lie, he speaketh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, out of) <span class="cmt_word">his own</span> resources - from what is most entirely his own, revealing the depth of his truthless, loveless, fatal, godless nature. Schaff quotes from Gothe's 'Faust' the account which Mephistopheles gives of his own being. Here it is in Kegan Paul's translation - <p><span class="accented">"I am the spirit, who aye deny!<br />And rightly so; for everything<br />Is only good for perishing;<br />So better 'twere that nought had been,<br />And, therefore, all that you call sin<br />Ruin, whate'er with evil's rife<br />Is my true element of life."</span> Gothe exactly expressed the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> by "mein eigentliches element." <span class="cmt_word">Because he is a liar, and the father of the liar.</span> This translation makes the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, which is the most natural antecedent (so Bengel, Meyer, Lange, Godet, etc.), notwithstanding the difficulty of the construction. This language asserts not only the agelong proof which history gives of the falsehood of this terrible personality, but declares that he exerts an evil paternity in the life of every liar. "Brood of vipers" is a phrase used by John Baptist and Christ himself when addressing Pharisees. The well known imagery of the first promise, "I will put enmity between her seed and thy seed," etc., suggests the same thought. There is an awful significance in this power of the devil to sow his deadly seed in human life, and to produce thus, on the soil of human nature, "children of the wicked one" (cf. Paul's language, <a href="/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10</a>, addressed to Elymas, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "son of the devil"). Another translation makes <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">He is a liar, and the father of falsehood</span>, or <span class="accented">thereof</span> (Revised Version); thus drawing an abstract out of the concrete <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or possibly referring to the first he which slew the spiritual life of men - to the "Ye shall not surely die" of <a href="/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4</a>. It is against this view that our Lord is here dealing with persons rather than with abstractions. Westcott and Moulton and Revised Version in margin have given indefiniteness to the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>, and translate, "Whensoever one [or, 'a man'] speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for his father also is a liar;" the idea being that the evil inheritance from the father of lies has even made falsehood the essential element, the <span class="accented">proprium</span>, of the liar. This, however, appears to involve a very complicated thought. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, if strictly spoken, contradicts the idea of the liar's peculiarities being the result of inheritance. Still less satisfactory is the vain endeavour of the Gnostics, who found here a second reference to the father of the devil. They discovered in some Italic Versions, and in the usage of some of the Fathers, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, in place of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, and so took it to mean, "he is a liar, as also his father." Higenfeld and Volkmar have fastened upon this text also, and thus found further proof of Gnostic (Ophite) heresy in the Gospel. Riggenbach and Godet have remarked that, if the father of the devil was spoken of in the previous clause, "his father" would mean "the father of the father of the devil"! We have already seen how groundless such a charge against the Gospel is, and how such a rendering would throw the entire context into confusion. If we accept the first translation, we find that our Lord announces a doctrine concerning the devil, and conveys more information than can be obtained from any other source. This is not mere accommodation to the consciousness of a daemoniac or the prejudices of the Jews, as some have interpreted Christ's language in the synoptic Gospels, but it is distinct dogmatic teaching about the personality, character, and method of the devil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
