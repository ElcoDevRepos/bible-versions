The prophets often spoke of a future time when God's people would have a direct relationship with Him. This connection underscores the fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus' ministry. <a href="/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a> is a specific reference, where it speaks of all children being taught by the Lord, highlighting the divine instruction that would characterize the Messianic age.<p><b>&#8216;And they will all be taught by God.&#8217;</b><br>This prophecy emphasizes the direct teaching and revelation from God to His people, suggesting a personal and intimate relationship with the Divine. In the context of Jesus' ministry, it points to the new covenant where the Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in teaching believers (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>). This teaching is not limited to a select few but is available to all, indicating the inclusive nature of the Gospel. It also reflects the democratization of spiritual knowledge, moving away from reliance solely on human teachers.<p><b>Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him</b><br>This phrase suggests an active engagement with God's revelation. Hearing and learning from the Father implies a process of spiritual discernment and understanding that goes beyond mere intellectual knowledge. It involves a heart open to God's voice, as seen in the parables of Jesus where hearing is often linked to understanding and obedience (<a href="/matthew/13-9.htm">Matthew 13:9-16</a>). This also connects to the idea of being drawn by the Father, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>, indicating divine initiative in the process of coming to faith.<p><b>comes to Me&#8212;</b><br>The culmination of being taught by God and learning from the Father is coming to Jesus. This underscores the centrality of Christ in God's plan of salvation. It affirms that true understanding and relationship with God lead one to Jesus, who is the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).

This solemn truth is affirmed by the entire history of Christ. The vision of his majesty, even contact with his ineffable love, the sight of his humiliation and of the shedding of his precious blood, did not, by any necessarily acting law of mind, induce faith. Divine teaching by the Spirit of the Father and Son is the preliminary (see notes on John 16:5-8, on the mission of the Comforter) to believing on Christ. "Taught of God" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), translated in Vulgate, <span class="accented">docibiles Dei</span> (cf. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>), means more than the reception of one lesson in the school of God, and suggests a prolonged experience and a rich communion between the Teacher and the taught. <span class="cmt_word">Every</span> <span class="cmt_word">one</span> (therefore) [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, referring to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 45<span class="accented">a</span>, and to the quotation, is not so much every human being, as the "all" of the Messianic kingdom - the "all" of God's "sons" and "<span class="accented">children</span> "] <span class="cmt_word">that hath heard</span> <span class="cmt_word">from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father, and hath learned</span> (<span class="accented">of him</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>cometh unto me.</span> Hearing may end in heedlessness, even when the Lord God Almighty speaks with us. His revelations at great epochs, his inner voice at special moments in our religious history, may be disregarded. The voice of God may be heard, yet not obeyed; the voice of conscience and revelation and inspiration, the sacred monitions and warnings of the heart, may all be slighted. But every one that hath heard the Father, and has also accepted the lesson - has felt the Divine drawing; being willing to do the will of the Father, he knows of the doctrine, whether it be of God, and he comes to Christ. Later on, Christ said, "Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice." It is one thing to "hear," another to "learn," another to "come." These three stages still further illumine the "drawing" of the Father, and the method which the Father has adopted of so giving men to Christ that he may ultimately fold them in his arms and press them to his heart. Lest, however, the hearers of Jesus, then or now, should conclude that the kind of direct teaching of which the prophets spake, and which he endorsed, was of that immediate kind which himself enjoyed, and which alone justifies this language, he continued - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">It is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
