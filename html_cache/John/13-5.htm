The pouring of water into a basin is a preparatory act for foot washing, a task typically performed by the lowest servant in a household. This act of humility by Jesus is a powerful demonstration of servant leadership, contrasting with the cultural norms of the time where leaders were served rather than serving others. The use of water is symbolic of cleansing, which is a recurring theme in Scripture, pointing to spiritual purification and renewal.<p><b>and began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet</b><br>Foot washing was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern culture due to the dusty roads and the wearing of sandals. By washing the disciples' feet, Jesus exemplifies humility and service, setting an example for His followers to emulate. This act foreshadows His ultimate act of service and sacrifice on the cross. It also fulfills the role of a servant, highlighting the reversal of roles that Jesus often taught about in His ministry. This act is a physical manifestation of the spiritual cleansing that Jesus offers to all believers.<p><b>and dry them with the towel that was around Him</b><br>The use of the towel signifies Jesus' readiness to serve and His personal involvement in the act of cleansing. By drying the disciples' feet with the towel, Jesus completes the task with care and attention, emphasizing the thoroughness of His service. This act can be seen as a type of the atonement, where Jesus not only cleanses but also restores and comforts. The towel, being around Him, symbolizes His willingness to take on the role of a servant, further illustrating the humility and love that characterize His ministry. This action is a call to His followers to serve one another in love and humility, as He has demonstrated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating humility and servanthood by washing His disciples' feet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are present at the Last Supper, receiving this act of service from their Master.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The location where the Last Supper takes place, a setting for intimate teaching and fellowship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_basin_and_towel.htm">The Basin and Towel</a></b><br>Symbols of servitude and humility, used by Jesus to perform the foot-washing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The event during which this act of foot-washing occurs, marking the beginning of Jesus' final teachings before His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_leadership.htm">Humility in Leadership</a></b><br>Jesus, the Master and Teacher, humbles Himself to serve His disciples, setting an example for all leaders to follow.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/servanthood_as_a_mark_of_discipleship.htm">Servanthood as a Mark of Discipleship</a></b><br>True discipleship involves serving others selflessly, as Jesus demonstrated.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_cleansing.htm">Symbolism of Cleansing</a></b><br>The act of washing feet symbolizes spiritual cleansing and the forgiveness of sins.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/breaking_social_norms.htm">Breaking Social Norms</a></b><br>Jesus challenges cultural expectations by performing a task typically reserved for the lowest servant, teaching us to transcend societal norms in service to others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_ministry.htm">Preparation for Ministry</a></b><br>Jesus prepares His disciples for their future ministry by modeling the heart of a servant, emphasizing that service is foundational to Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_13_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 13:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_13_5_Jesus_humble_leadership.htm">How does John 13:5 demonstrate Jesus' humility and servant leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Jesus_washing_feet.htm">What can we learn from Jesus washing the disciples' feet in John 13:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_13_5_Phil_2_7_on_servanthood.htm">How does John 13:5 connect to Philippians 2:7 about Jesus' servanthood?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_John_13_5_to_daily_life.htm">How can we apply Jesus' example in John 13:5 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_serving_from_foot_washing.htm">What does "began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet" teach about serving others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jesus_wash_disciples_feet_2.htm">Why did Jesus wash the disciples' feet in John 13:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Foot_washing_s_biblical_significance_2.htm">What is the significance of foot washing in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_13_5_show_Jesus_humility.htm">How does John 13:5 demonstrate Jesus' humility and servanthood?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_wash_the_disciples'_feet.htm">What was Jesus' purpose in washing the disciples' feet?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_jewelry.htm">How do you show honor to others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_is_judas's_possession_unique_to_john.htm">In John 13:27, how can Judas be possessed by Satan, and why is this scenario omitted in other Gospels?
