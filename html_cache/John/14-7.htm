Knowing Jesus goes beyond mere acquaintance; it involves a deep, personal understanding of His nature and mission. In the Jewish context, "knowing" often implies a covenant relationship, as seen in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>). Jesus is challenging His disciples to recognize His divine identity and mission, which is central to understanding the nature of God.<p><b>you would know My Father as well.</b><br>Here, Jesus asserts the unity between Himself and the Father. This statement reflects the theological concept of the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet one. In Jewish tradition, God is often seen as transcendent and unknowable, but Jesus reveals that knowing Him is equivalent to knowing the Father. This aligns with passages like <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, "I and the Father are one," highlighting the divine nature of Christ and His role as the mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>From now on you do know Him</b><br>This marks a turning point in the disciples' understanding. Jesus is preparing them for a deeper revelation of God's nature through His impending death and resurrection. The phrase suggests a new era of revelation, where the disciples will come to know God more fully through the Holy Spirit, as promised in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>. This also connects to the prophetic promise of a new covenant, where God will write His law on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>and have seen Him.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus concludes with a profound declaration of His divine identity. By seeing Jesus, the disciples have seen the Father, underscoring the incarnation&#8212;God made flesh. This statement is a fulfillment of the longing expressed in the Old Testament to see God (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). It also foreshadows the future vision of God in the New Jerusalem, where His servants will see His face (<a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>). Jesus embodies the visible image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), making the divine accessible to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples, revealing His divine nature and unity with the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being prepared for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father (God)</a></b><br>Referred to by Jesus, emphasizing the intimate relationship and unity between Him and the Father.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_unity_of_the_trinity.htm">Understanding the Unity of the Trinity</a></b><br>Jesus' statement underscores the unity within the Trinity.

The emphasis of the first part of the sentence is not upon "Me" as is generally supposed, but upon "known." In the second part the emphatic words are "My Father." The English word "known" represents two Greek words in the better text which are not identical in meaning. The former means, to know by observation, the latter to know by reflection.
