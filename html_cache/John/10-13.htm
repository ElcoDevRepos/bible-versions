In biblical times, shepherds were expected to protect their flock from predators and thieves. A true shepherd, as opposed to a hired hand, would risk his life for the sheep. This distinction is crucial in understanding the role of Jesus as the Good Shepherd, who lays down His life for His sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). The imagery of running away contrasts with the steadfastness and courage expected of a true leader or protector.<p><b>because he is a hired servant</b><br>The term "hired servant" refers to someone who works for wages rather than out of genuine care or ownership. In the cultural context of the time, hired hands were often seen as less reliable than those who had a personal stake in the flock. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the difference between those who serve God out of love and commitment versus those who do so for personal gain or obligation. The hired servant's lack of personal investment in the sheep symbolizes religious leaders who are more concerned with their own interests than with the spiritual well-being of their followers.<p><b>and is unconcerned for the sheep.</b><br>This phrase underscores the indifference of the hired servant towards the sheep, which can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual leaders who neglect their duties. In <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, God condemns the shepherds of Israel for failing to care for the flock, a prophecy that finds fulfillment in Jesus' critique of the Pharisees and religious leaders of His time. The lack of concern is contrasted with Jesus' deep compassion and care for His followers, as seen in His willingness to sacrifice Himself for their salvation. This serves as a call for true spiritual leaders to prioritize the welfare of their flock above their own interests.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, presenting Himself as the Good Shepherd in contrast to the hired servant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hired_servant.htm">Hired Servant</a></b><br>Represents those who care for the sheep only for personal gain and lack genuine concern.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolic of believers who require protection and guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_shepherd.htm">The Good Shepherd</a></b><br>A title Jesus uses for Himself, emphasizing His sacrificial love and commitment to His followers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Represents the community of believers under the care of the Good Shepherd.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_true_leadership.htm">The Nature of True Leadership</a></b><br>True leaders, like the Good Shepherd, prioritize the well-being of those they lead over personal gain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_the_flock.htm">Commitment to the Flock</a></b><br>Believers are called to be committed to their community, reflecting the dedication of the Good Shepherd.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_leadership.htm">Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>Christians should discern between true and false leaders, recognizing those who genuinely care for their spiritual well-being.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/security_in_christ.htm">Security in Christ</a></b><br>Believers can find security in Jesus, the Good Shepherd, who will never abandon them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_serve_selflessly.htm">Call to Serve Selflessly</a></b><br>Followers of Christ are encouraged to serve others selflessly, emulating the Good Shepherd's example.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_10_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 10:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_10_13_Hireling_vs_Shepherd.htm">How does John 10:13 illustrate the difference between a hireling and a shepherd?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Hired_servant_s_lack_of_commitment.htm">What does "flees because he is a hired servant" reveal about commitment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_John_10_13_shepherd_s_dedication.htm">How can we apply the shepherd's dedication in John 10:13 to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_John_10_13_Psalm_23_1_on_God_s_care.htm">Compare John 10:13 with Psalm 23:1.
