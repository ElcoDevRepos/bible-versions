The "day" refers to the Day of the Lord, a common theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing a time of divine intervention and judgment. This concept is echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a>, where the Day of the Lord is depicted as both a time of judgment and salvation.<p><b>burning like a furnace</b><br>The imagery of a furnace conveys intense heat and purification. In biblical times, a furnace was used for refining metals, symbolizing the purging of impurities. This metaphor suggests a thorough and consuming judgment. Similar imagery is found in <a href="/isaiah/31-9.htm">Isaiah 31:9</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20-22</a>, where God's judgment is likened to fire.<p><b>when all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble</b><br>The "arrogant" and "evildoer" represent those who oppose God and His ways. In the agricultural context of ancient Israel, "stubble" refers to the dry remains of harvested crops, easily consumed by fire. This symbolizes the complete destruction of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>, where the wicked are compared to chaff and stubble.<p><b>the day is coming when I will set them ablaze,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The repetition of "the day is coming" underscores the certainty of this future event. "Set them ablaze" indicates divine judgment executed by God Himself. The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all creation, often used in contexts of divine warfare and judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Not a root or branch will be left to them.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase signifies total destruction, leaving nothing behind. In an agrarian society, roots and branches are essential for growth and survival, so their absence indicates complete eradication. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic warnings, such as in <a href="/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a> and <a href="/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>, where the destruction of roots and branches symbolizes the end of the wicked's influence and existence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the LORD</a></b><br>A prophetic event characterized by divine judgment and purification, often associated with the end times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arrogant_and_evildoers.htm">The Arrogant and Evildoers</a></b><br>Individuals who live in opposition to God's will, characterized by pride and sinful actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/furnace.htm">Furnace</a></b><br>A metaphor for intense heat and purification, symbolizing God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/stubble.htm">Stubble</a></b><br>Represents the temporary and worthless nature of the wicked in the face of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Judgment</a></b><br>The "day is coming" emphasizes the inevitability of God's judgment.
