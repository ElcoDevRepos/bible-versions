The process of refining silver involves intense heat to remove impurities, symbolizing God's method of purifying His people. The imagery of sitting suggests a deliberate and careful process, indicating God's patience and precision. In ancient times, a refiner would sit to carefully watch the metal, ensuring it was not destroyed but purified. This reflects God's attentive and purposeful work in the lives of believers, aligning with passages like <a href="/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>, where God refines His people through trials.<p><b>He will purify the sons of Levi</b><br>The sons of Levi refer to the Levitical priesthood, responsible for temple duties and sacrifices. Historically, the Levites were set apart for service to God, but by Malachi's time, they had become corrupt. This purification indicates a restoration of their role and integrity. The Levites' purification is symbolic of the broader purification of God's people, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/44-10.htm">Ezekiel 44:10-16</a>, where the Levites are called to return to faithful service. This also foreshadows the New Testament priesthood of all believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), purified through Christ.<p><b>and refine them like gold and silver.</b><br>Gold and silver are precious metals that require refining to achieve purity. This process involves removing dross, symbolizing the removal of sin and impurity from the lives of the Levites and, by extension, all believers. The comparison to gold and silver emphasizes the value and worth of those who are purified. This refining process is echoed in <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>, where God refines His people as silver is refined, highlighting the transformative power of divine discipline and sanctification.<p><b>Then they will present offerings to the LORD in righteousness.</b><br>The result of this purification is the ability to offer righteous sacrifices to God. In the Old Testament, offerings were central to worship and required to be without blemish. The purification ensures that the offerings are acceptable, symbolizing a restored relationship with God. This anticipates the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who enables believers to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15-16</a>). The emphasis on righteousness aligns with passages like <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are called to present themselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_refiner.htm">The Refiner</a></b><br>Represents God, who purifies and refines His people, particularly the priests, to make them righteous.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_levi.htm">The Sons of Levi</a></b><br>The Levitical priests, who were responsible for temple duties and offerings.

(See Note on <a href="/malachi/1-11.htm" title="For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:11</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall sit.</span> As a judge.
