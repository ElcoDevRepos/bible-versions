In the biblical context, a curse signifies divine disfavor and judgment. Deception in religious practices is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in the story of Ananias and Sapphira in <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>, where deceit in giving led to severe consequences.<p><b>who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it</b><br>The reference to an "acceptable male" aligns with the Levitical laws requiring offerings to be without blemish (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>). Vows were solemn promises made to God, and breaking them was considered a serious offense (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). This reflects the importance of integrity and sincerity in one's commitments to God.<p><b>but sacrifices a defective animal to the Lord</b><br>Offering a defective animal violates the sacrificial laws outlined in <a href="/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20-22</a>, which required offerings to be perfect. This act of giving less than one's best to God is a form of disrespect and reflects a heart not fully devoted to Him. It parallels the broader biblical theme of God desiring wholehearted devotion (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>).<p><b>For I am a great King,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The title "great King" emphasizes God's sovereignty and authority over all creation. The term "LORD of Hosts" underscores His command over the heavenly armies, indicating His power and majesty. This phrase reminds the reader of God's rightful place as the supreme ruler, deserving of honor and reverence.<p><b>and My name is to be feared among the nations</b><br>This statement points to the universal recognition and reverence that God demands and will ultimately receive. It echoes prophecies like those in <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, where every knee will bow to God. The fear of the Lord is a recurring biblical theme, signifying awe, respect, and submission to His will, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>.

The verse calls believers to authentic, wholehearted worship&#8212;offering God the first, finest, and fullest devotion He deserves. Anything less belies His kingship and dims His glory before the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/malachi/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) Some consider that two cases are mentioned in this verse. (1) One who acts deceitfully (by offering a <span class= "ital">female</span> as a <span class= "ital">burnt offering,</span> which is contrary to the Law, while there is in his flock a <span class= "ital">male</span>); (2) and one who makes <span class= "ital">a vow</span> (to offer a <span class= "ital">sacrifice of peace offerings,</span> for which either a male or a female was allowable, provided it were without a blemish: <a href="/leviticus/22-23.htm" title="Either a bullock or a lamb that has any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that may you offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.">Leviticus 22:23</a>), and then offers an animal that has a blemish. But it is better to understand but one case to be mentioned--viz., that of a man who <span class= "ital">vows,</span> and while he has a <span class= "ital">male</span> in his flock offers a <span class= "ital">female with a blemish.</span> A female without blemish would be admissible as a <span class= "ital">vow offering,</span> but a male without blemish would be the most valuable, because it could be offered as a burnt offering, whereas a female could not; while a female with a blemish would be the very worst, and actually illegal. A man is not bound to make a vow, but if he make one his offering should be of the very best, just as he would not dare to offer to a king or to his ruler (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm" title="A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? said the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And you say, Wherein have we despised your name?">Malachi 1:6</a>) anything but the best. How cursed, then, must he be who, while he possesses the best, deliberately makes a vow to God, and then offers Him the very worst.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">cursed be the deceiver.</span> The curse is fulminated against all who are guilty of these violations of the Law. The prophet mentions two instances out of many. The first is of one who offers a female victim, on pretence that he has no male in his flock. This will be clearer if we translate, with Keil, "And cursed is he who deceives, whereas there is in his flock a male animal." Septuagint, "Cursed is he who was able and bad in his flock a male." <span class="cmt_word">And voweth...a corrupt</span> (<span class="accented">blemished</span>) <span class="cmt_word">thing</span>.
