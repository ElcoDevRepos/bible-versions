Historically, Israel was chosen to be a light to the nations, but this prophecy extends beyond Israel to include all nations. It reflects the Abrahamic covenant where God promised that all nations would be blessed through Abraham's seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This is fulfilled in the New Testament through the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), where the gospel is to be preached to all nations, indicating the spread of God's glory worldwide.<p><b>from where the sun rises to where it sets</b><br>This expression signifies the entirety of the earth, from east to west. It underscores the omnipresence and sovereignty of God over all creation. In biblical times, this would have been a poetic way to describe the whole world, emphasizing that God's greatness is not confined to a single geographic location. This phrase also connects to <a href="/psalms/113-3.htm">Psalm 113:3</a>, which speaks of God's name being praised from the rising to the setting of the sun.<p><b>In every place, incense and pure offerings will be presented in My name</b><br>Incense and offerings were integral to worship in the Old Testament, symbolizing prayer and devotion (<a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>). The mention of "every place" suggests a future where worship is not limited to the temple in Jerusalem but is global and spiritual. This foreshadows the New Covenant, where worship is in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>). The "pure offerings" indicate a sincere and holy worship, contrasting with the corrupt sacrifices criticized earlier in Malachi.<p><b>because My name will be great among the nations,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The repetition of God's name being great among the nations reinforces the certainty of this prophecy. The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's authority and power as the commander of heavenly armies. This assurance of God's name being honored worldwide points to the eschatological hope where God's kingdom is fully realized on earth. It also reflects the ultimate victory of God's purposes, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation worships before the throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The last prophet in the Old Testament, Malachi's name means "my messenger."

If we take the words as referring to the present, we are met by the insurmountable difficulty that in no sense, at the time of Malachi, could the Lord's Name be said to be great over all the earth, or pure sacrifices to be offered to Him in every place. Nor can we, with many commentators, suppose that heathen rites are here referred to as being offered ignorantly, through idols, to the one true God. (Comp. Pope's universal prayer:--<p>"Father of all, in every age,<p>In every clime adored,<p>By saint, by savage, and by sage,<p>Jehovah, Jove, or Lord!")<p>For there is no hint given of any such meaning being intended; and, moreover, such a sentiment would be quite foreign to the Old Testament, which always represents heathen rites as being an utter abomination, and always speaks of the adhesion of the Gentiles to the worship of the true God as a thing of the future. We are compelled, therefore, to take the words as a prophetic announcement of the future rejection of Israel and calling of the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">In every place.</span>--In contradistinction to the <span class= "ital">one</span> place (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-5.htm" title="But to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and thither you shall come:">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>). (Comp. our Lord's words to the woman of Samaria: <a href="/context/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21-24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Incense shall be offered</span> . . .--This is a possible rendering of the words; but this Hebrew word is not elsewhere used for "incense," and may more naturally be rendered <span class= "ital">shall be burnt,</span> as the passive participle of the verb used in <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm" title="But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 1:9</a>. Dr. Pusey's footnote on this passage is well worth reading, as, indeed, his <span class= "ital">footnotes</span> usually are. We prefer, therefore, to take the words thus: "an oblation shall be burnt to my name, even a pure offering." In any case, unless we are to expect some future establishment of a universal offering of material sacrifices, we must understand both expressions in a spiritual sense, which is, in truth, the only reasonable way of interpreting such passages. (See Notes on <a href="/context/zechariah/2-6.htm" title="Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, said the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, said the LORD.">Zechariah 2:6-13</a>; <a href="/context/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8-10</a>; <a href="/context/zechariah/6-9.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Zechariah 6:9-15</a>, and especially 14:16-21.) If, therefore, any Christians would claim this verse as a support for their custom of offering incense in churches, they must conform also with <a href="/context/zechariah/14-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.">Zechariah 14:16-21</a>, and go up every year to Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. The word "offering," as in the preceding verse (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/2-17.htm" title="Why the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.">1Samuel 2:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm" title="Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.">Isaiah 1:13</a>), denotes sacrificial gifts in general, not the flour offerings as distinguished from the flesh offerings. The word "pure" is emphatic, not as signifying the bloodless sacrifice of the Mass (Council of Trent), as distinguished from the bloody sacrifices, but as the converse of "polluted" (<a href="/malachi/1-7.htm" title="You offer polluted bread on my altar; and you say, Wherein have we polluted you? In that you say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.">Malachi 1:7</a>). The above remarks we have made in no controversial spirit, but simply in the interests of truth; and lest any should suppose us to imply that the above interpretation was <span class= "ital">originated</span> by the Council of Trent, we refer the reader to Dr. Pusey's Commentary, in which he shows, by quotations from SS. Justin, Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Cyprian, Cyril of Jerusalem, Chrysostom, and Augustine, as also from Tertullian, Eusebius, and Theodoret, that it is <span class= "ital">quod semper, quod ab omnibus, quod ubique.</span> Those, therefore, who prefer so-called <span class= "ital">authority</span> to the results of calm criticism are bound to disagree with us. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My Name shall be great.</span> The course of thought is this: God does not need the worship of the Jews and their impious priests; he needs not their maimed sacrifices; his majesty shall be recognized throughout the wide world, and pure worship shall be offered to him from every nation under heaven. How, then, shall he not punish those who, being his elect, ought to have been an example of holiness, and prepaid the way for his universal reception? The LXX. treats this circumstance as already occurring at this time, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "My Name hath been and is glorified." This could only be said if it was allowed that the heathen in some sense, however blindly and imperfectly, did worship the true God. But the notion cannot be upheld for a moment; and there is a general consensus of commentators in referring the time to the Messianic future, when God's power is acknowledged and worship offered to him, not in Jerusalem alone, but in every place. The participles in this verse may be rendered by presents or futures, but there can be little doubt that a prophecy is intended, and not a statement of a fact - which, indeed, could not be truthfully maintained. When such a future is in stere, is this a time for Jewish priests to dishonour Jehovah? <span class="cmt_word">Incense shall be offered unto my Name, and a pure offering</span> (<span class="accented">minchah</span>). The universal worship is expressed in the terms of the Jewish ritual (see note on Zephaniah 3:10). The Hebrew is more forcibly rendered, <span class="accented">In every place incense is burned, oblation made unto my Name, and indeed a pure oblation.</span> Incense is to our minds a type of prayer (<a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>, etc.); the pure oblation is the symbol of the Christian sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; and the prophet, rising superior to Jewish prejudices, announces that this prayer and sacrifice shall no longer be confined to one place or one specially favoured country, but be universal, worldwide. The Fathers and mediaeval writers, and many modern commentators, see in this verse a prophecy of the Holy Eucharist, the "pure offering" commemorative of Christ's sacrifice, which is found in every nation under heaven where the Name of Christ is adored. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/malachi/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My name</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
