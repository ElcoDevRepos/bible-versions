Profaning something means to treat it with irreverence or disrespect. In the context of Malachi, the priests were offering blemished sacrifices, which was against the Law (<a href="/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21-22</a>). This reflects a broader theme in the Old Testament where God calls His people to holiness and reverence (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>when you say,</b><br>The phrase indicates that the profanation is not only in actions but also in words. The speech of the priests and people reveals their heart attitude towards God and His commands. This aligns with the biblical principle that words reflect the heart (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>).<p><b>&#8216;The table of the Lord is defiled,</b><br>The "table of the Lord" refers to the altar where sacrifices were made. By calling it defiled, the priests were expressing disdain for the sacrificial system established by God. This reflects a lack of faith and reverence, similar to the attitude of Eli's sons in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>, who treated the Lord's offerings with contempt.<p><b>and as for its fruit,</b><br>The "fruit" here refers to the offerings and sacrifices brought to the altar. In the Old Testament, offerings were meant to be the best of what people had (<a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>). The term "fruit" can also symbolize the results or outcomes of one's actions, indicating that the priests were not valuing the spiritual significance of the sacrifices.<p><b>its food is contemptible.&#8217;</b><br>The priests considered the food of the sacrifices, which was meant to be holy and pleasing to God, as contemptible or worthless. This attitude shows a deep spiritual decline and a failure to honor God with their best. This mirrors the warning in <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-14</a>, where God expresses His displeasure with empty rituals and sacrifices that are not accompanied by genuine devotion and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The last prophet in the Old Testament, Malachi's name means "my messenger."
