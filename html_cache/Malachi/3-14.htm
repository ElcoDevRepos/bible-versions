Historically, this period follows the return from Babylonian exile, during which the Israelites expected prosperity and blessing. However, they faced economic hardship and social injustice, leading to a questioning of the value of their covenantal relationship with God. This attitude is reminiscent of the Israelites' complaints during their wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>). Theologically, it challenges the understanding of serving God as inherently rewarding, a theme explored in the Book of Job.<p><b>What have we gained by keeping His requirements</b><br>The people question the tangible benefits of adhering to God's laws. This reflects a transactional view of faith, where obedience is expected to yield immediate rewards. The "requirements" refer to the Mosaic Law, which was central to Jewish life and worship. This perspective contrasts with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized storing up treasures in heaven rather than seeking earthly rewards (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>). The historical context shows a community struggling with unmet expectations of divine favor.<p><b>and walking mournfully before the LORD of Hosts?</b><br>"Walking mournfully" suggests a ritualistic observance of religious duties without joy or genuine devotion. The term "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power, often used in contexts emphasizing His authority over heavenly armies. This phrase indicates a disconnect between the people's external religious practices and their internal spiritual state. It echoes the prophetic calls for sincere worship rather than mere ritual (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>). The lament here is not just about personal loss but a perceived lack of divine justice, a theme that resonates with the cries for justice found in the Psalms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message to the Israelites.

We see here, in already a somewhat developed form, that disposition to attribute merit to observances of outward forms of religion for their own sake, without regard to the secret attitude of the heart, which reached such a pitch among the majority of the Jews in the time of our Lord, and especially among the Pharisees.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is vain.</span> It brings no acknowledgment or reward.
