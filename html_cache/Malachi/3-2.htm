The "day of His coming" refers to the anticipated day of judgment, a theme prevalent in prophetic literature. This echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a> and <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>, where the day of the Lord is depicted as both great and dreadful. The question implies that no one, in their own strength, can withstand the holiness and justice of God. It serves as a call to repentance and spiritual preparedness.<p><b>And who can stand when He appears?</b><br>The imagery of standing before the Lord suggests judgment and accountability. In biblical terms, to "stand" often implies being justified or found righteous (<a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>). This phrase underscores the idea that only those who are purified and righteous can withstand the presence of God. It connects to <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>, where the question is asked, "For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?" This highlights the need for divine grace and redemption.<p><b>For He will be like a refiner&#8217;s fire,</b><br>The metaphor of a refiner's fire illustrates the process of purification. In ancient times, refining involved heating metals to remove impurities, symbolizing the purifying judgment of God. This imagery is consistent with passages like <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>, where trials and divine intervention serve to purify and strengthen faith. The refiner's fire is a type of Christ's work in sanctifying believers, removing sin and refining character.<p><b>like a launderer&#8217;s soap.</b><br>Launderer's soap, or fuller&#8217;s soap, was used in ancient times to clean and whiten garments. This metaphor complements the refiner's fire, emphasizing cleansing and purification. It suggests the removal of moral and spiritual impurities, aligning with <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where God invites His people to be cleansed and made white as snow. This cleansing is a type of the sanctifying work of Christ, who purifies His church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26-27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message to the Israelites, calling them to repentance and foretelling the coming of the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_his_coming.htm">The Day of His Coming</a></b><br>Refers to the anticipated day of the Lord's judgment and purification.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/refiner's_fire.htm">Refiner&#8217;s Fire</a></b><br>A metaphor for the process of purification, removing impurities from precious metals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/launderer's_soap.htm">Launderer&#8217;s Soap</a></b><br>Symbolizes cleansing and purification, removing stains and making garments clean.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of Malachi's prophecy, who were being called to return to faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_faith.htm">Endurance in Faith</a></b><br>The question "Who can endure the day of His coming?" challenges believers to examine their faith and readiness for the Lord's return.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purification_process.htm">Purification Process</a></b><br>Just as a refiner's fire purifies metal, God uses trials and challenges to purify our hearts and strengthen our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_cleansing.htm">Spiritual Cleansing</a></b><br>Like a launderer's soap, God's Word and Spirit cleanse us from sin, calling us to live holy lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/anticipation_of_christ's_return.htm">Anticipation of Christ's Return</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to live in anticipation of Christ's return, maintaining a posture of readiness and holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_trials.htm">Transformation through Trials</a></b><br>Embrace trials as opportunities for spiritual growth and transformation, trusting in God's refining work.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Malachi_3_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Malachi 3:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prepare_for_the_Lord_s_coming.htm">How can we prepare for the Lord's coming as described in Malachi 3:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_refiner_s_fire_in_life.htm">What does it mean to be "like a refiner's fire" in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Malachi_3_2_NT_purification_link.htm">How does Malachi 3:2 connect to New Testament teachings on purification?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_achieve_daily_spiritual_purity.htm">In what ways can we seek spiritual purification in our daily walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_explain_Malachi_3_2_refining.htm">How can we help others understand the refining process mentioned in Malachi 3:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_the_day_of_His_coming.htm">What does Malachi 3:2 mean by "the day of His coming"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Malachi_3_2_test_our_view.htm">How does Malachi 3:2 challenge our understanding of God's judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_refiner_s_fire_in_Malachi_3_2.htm">Why is the imagery of a refiner's fire used in Malachi 3:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_malachi_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Malachi 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_'refiner's_fire'_purely_symbolic.htm">Malachi 3:2 &#8211; Is the &#8220;refiner&#8217;s fire&#8221; imagery purely symbolic, and does it conflict with any scientific or historical understanding of purification?

Scripture treats that day as intense, unavoidable, and decisive.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a> declares, &#8220;For the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; who can endure it?&#8221;&#8212;matching Malachi&#8217;s very wording and weight.<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a> warns those who long for the day without realizing its severity.<p>&#8226; In the New Testament the same theme surfaces when Paul writes, &#8220;The day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>).<p>Malachi asks a rhetorical question: no one in his own strength can bear that day.
