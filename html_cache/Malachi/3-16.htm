In the context of Malachi, the Israelites were rebuked for their spiritual apathy and disobedience. Those who "feared the LORD" were a remnant who remained faithful. This fear is not terror but a reverent awe and respect for God's holiness and authority. The act of speaking with one another suggests mutual encouragement and accountability, reminiscent of <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>, which emphasizes the importance of believers gathering to encourage one another.<p><b>and the LORD listened and heard them</b><br>This indicates God's attentiveness to the faithful. Unlike the indifferent or rebellious, those who genuinely seek God are assured of His attention. This reflects the biblical theme that God is near to those who call on Him in truth (<a href="/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a>). It also underscores the personal relationship between God and His people, where He is not a distant deity but one who is actively involved in the lives of His followers.<p><b>So a scroll of remembrance was written before Him</b><br>The scroll of remembrance signifies a divine record of the faithful's deeds and words. In ancient times, kings kept records of significant events and loyal subjects, as seen in <a href="/esther/6.htm">Esther 6:1-2</a>. This imagery assures believers that their faithfulness is noted by God and will not be forgotten. It parallels the Book of Life mentioned in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, where the deeds of individuals are recorded for judgment.<p><b>regarding those who feared the LORD and honored His name</b><br>This reiterates the characteristics of the faithful: fear of the LORD and honoring His name. To honor God's name is to live in a way that reflects His character and commands. This phrase emphasizes the importance of both internal reverence and external actions. It connects to the broader biblical narrative where God's name is to be revered and His commandments followed, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). The faithful remnant serves as a type of Christ, who perfectly feared and honored the Father, setting an example for believers to follow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_feared_the_lord.htm">Those Who Feared the LORD</a></b><br>This refers to the faithful remnant of Israel who revered God and remained committed to His commandments despite the prevailing unfaithfulness around them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is attentive to the words and actions of His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/scroll_of_remembrance.htm">Scroll of Remembrance</a></b><br>A metaphorical or literal record kept by God to remember those who are faithful and honor His name.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered this message, addressing the spiritual and moral issues of the post-exilic Jewish community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community_of_believers.htm">The Community of Believers</a></b><br>The group of faithful individuals who encouraged one another in their devotion to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_fear.htm">The Importance of Godly Fear</a></b><br>Fearing the LORD is foundational to a faithful life.

What "they that feared the Lord" said is not recorded; but it is implied, by His approval of them, that they strengthened one another in their faith and reliance on the goodness and faithfulness of the Lord, in spite of the present appearance of things. As the godless in Israel conversed together, so did the godly; but the converse of the one was the very reverse of the converse of the other. In <a href="/ezra/9-4.htm" title="Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.">Ezra 9:4</a> we read of such a consultation among those "that trembled at the word of the God of Israel." (Comp. the expression in <a href="/malachi/2-5.htm" title="My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared me, and was afraid before my name.">Malachi 2:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Book of remembrance.</span>--In which men's actions are said figuratively to be recorded (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm" title="You tell my wanderings: put you my tears into your bottle: are they not in your book?">Psalm 56:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm" title="A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.">Daniel 7:10</a>, &c.). Compare the custom of the Persian kings (<a href="/esther/6-1.htm" title="On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.">Esther 6:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - With these impious murmurers the prophet contrasts those who fear God, as above (<a href="/malachi/2-5.htm">Malachi 2:5-7</a>) he set the picture of the true priest in opposition to his delineation of the evil ministers. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. When the impious made the above infidel remarks, the pious spake often, conversed together. What they said is not repeated, but it was language well pleasing unto God, who deigned to listen to their words, and to console them by announcing the future destiny of the good and the evil. They may have argued with these impious talkers, and warned others against them; or they may have expostulated as <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>, but yet with full faith that what God does is always good; and this sentiment was all the harder to cherish because they lived under a system of temporal rewards and punishments. The Septuagint and Syriac have, "These things spake they that feared the Lord," as if the two preceding verses reported the words of the pious. Some Fathers and commentators have taken the same view. But it is difficult to conceive such words coming from the mouth of those who fear God; unless they are so called ironically. But this is inadmissible, as we see that in the present verse they are represented in their true character, and such a sudden change from irony to actuality is unnatural and quite opposed to the prophet's usual manner. <span class="cmt_word">A book of remembrance was written before him.</span> The hook represents God's providence and omniscience, his ever-wakeful care, his unfailing knowledge. "Are not these things noted in thy book?" says the psalmist (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>); and when the dead were judged, Daniel saw that the books were opened (<a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). The idea is taken from the national records wherein were noted events of importance, such as we find in the cuneiform inscriptions (comp. <a href="/1_kings/11-41.htm">1 Kings 11:41</a>, etc.; <a href="/ezra/4-15.htm">Ezra 4:15</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1</a>; <a href="/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).
