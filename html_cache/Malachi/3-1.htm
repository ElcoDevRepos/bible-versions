In the historical context, this is often understood as a reference to John the Baptist, who is seen as the forerunner of Jesus Christ. The role of a messenger in ancient times was crucial for communication, often carrying important news or instructions from a king. This aligns with the prophetic tradition in the Old Testament, where God frequently used prophets to deliver His messages to the people.<p><b>who will prepare the way before Me.</b><br>The preparation of the way is a metaphor for making ready the hearts of the people for the coming of the Lord. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, which speaks of a voice calling in the wilderness to prepare the way for the Lord. John the Baptist fulfills this prophecy by calling people to repentance and baptizing them, thus preparing them spiritually for the arrival of Jesus.<p><b>Then the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple&#8212;</b><br>This phrase indicates the sudden and unexpected arrival of the Lord, which can be linked to Jesus' cleansing of the temple as described in the Gospels. The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and the presence of God, making it a significant location for the fulfillment of this prophecy. The suddenness emphasizes the need for readiness and vigilance among the people.<p><b>the Messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight&#8212;</b><br>Here, the "Messenger of the covenant" is understood to be Jesus Christ, who brings the new covenant prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>. This covenant is characterized by a personal relationship with God, written on the hearts of believers. The delight in this messenger reflects the deep longing and expectation for the Messiah, who would bring salvation and restoration.<p><b>see, He is coming,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The declaration "He is coming" underscores the certainty and imminence of the prophecy's fulfillment. The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, often used in contexts where divine intervention is assured. This assurance would have been particularly comforting to the Jewish people, who were awaiting deliverance and the establishment of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messenger.htm">The Messenger</a></b><br>This refers to a prophetic figure who prepares the way for the Lord.

Moreover, from the nature of his mission, he is proved to be identical with the "Elijah" of <a href="/malachi/4-3.htm" title="And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 4:3</a>. These words had their first, if not their perfect fulfilment in John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/17-12.htm" title="But I say to you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.">Matthew 17:12</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I will send</span> (<span class="accented">I send</span>) <span class="cmt_word">my messenger.</span> God answers that he is coming to show himself the God of judgment and justice. Are they ready to meet him and to bear his sentence? Who this "messenger" is is disputed. That no angel or heavenly visitant is meant is clear from historical considerations, as no such event took place immediately before the Lord came to his temple. Nor can Malachi himself be intended, as his message was delivered nearly four, hundred years before Messiah came. The announcement is doubtless founded upon <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, and refers to the same person as the older prophet mentions, who is generally allowed to be John the Baptist, the herald of Christ's advent (<a href="/matthew/11-10.htm">Matthew 11:10</a>; <a href="/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Prepare the way before me.</span> The expression is borrowed from Isaiah, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span> (comp. also <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>). He prepares the way by preaching repentance, and thus removing the obstacle of sin which stood between God and his people. <span class="cmt_word">Whom ye seek.</span> When ye ask, "Where is the God of judgment?" <span class="cmt_word">Shall suddenly come to his temple.</span> The Lord (<span class="accented">ha-Adon</span>) is Jehovah, as in <a href="/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, etc. There is a change of persons here, as frequently. Jehovah shall unexpectedly come to his temple (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) <span class="accented">as</span> King and God of Israel (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>). There was a literal fulfilment of this prophecy when Christ was presented in the temple as an infant (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Even the messenger of the covenant.</span> He is identified with the Lord; and he is the covenant angel who guided the Israelites to the promised land, and who is seen in the various theophanies of the Old Testament. The Divinity of Messiah is thus unequivocally asserted. In him are fulfilled all the promises made under the old covenant, and he is called (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>) "the Mediator of the new covenant." Some render," and the Messenger," etc., thus distinguishing the Angel of the covenant from the forerunner who prepares the way.
