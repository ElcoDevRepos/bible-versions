In the context of Malachi, the people of Israel had become complacent and confused about what constituted true righteousness. Historically, this reflects a period of spiritual decline where the lines between good and evil had blurred. The promise of renewed discernment suggests a divine intervention that will restore moral clarity.<p><b>between the righteous and the wicked,</b><br>The distinction between the righteous and the wicked is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. In the Old Testament, righteousness is often associated with adherence to God's laws and commandments, while wickedness is linked to rebellion against God. This dichotomy is seen in the Psalms and Proverbs, where the righteous are blessed and the wicked face judgment. The prophetic books, including Malachi, emphasize that God will ultimately judge and separate the two groups, a theme that is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in the parables of Jesus, such as the Wheat and the Tares (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>).<p><b>between those who serve God</b><br>Serving God in the biblical context involves worship, obedience, and a life dedicated to His commandments. In Malachi's time, the priesthood and the people had failed in their service, offering blemished sacrifices and neglecting true worship. This phrase calls for a return to genuine service, reminiscent of the covenantal relationship established at Sinai, where Israel was called to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p><b>and those who do not.</b><br>This final distinction underscores the consequences of failing to serve God. Throughout Scripture, those who do not serve God are often depicted as facing divine judgment and separation from His blessings. In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of the final judgment where the sheep are separated from the goats (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>), illustrating the eternal consequences of one's choices in serving God or not. This serves as a warning and a call to repentance, urging individuals to align themselves with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The last prophet of the Old Testament, Malachi's name means "my messenger."

The LORD replies that a day is coming when the fog will lift and everyone will see who truly belongs to Him.<p>&#8226; This &#8220;again&#8221; points back to earlier times when Israel could plainly recognize God&#8217;s favor on the obedient&#8212;think of the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29-31</a> or Elijah&#8217;s fire-from-heaven moment in <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>.<p>&#8226; The promise looks ahead as well: the &#8220;day&#8221; described in <a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1-3</a> when God will judge evil and heal His own.
