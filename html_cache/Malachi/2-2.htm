In the biblical context, listening is often equated with obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). The Israelites were repeatedly called to hear and obey God's word, highlighting the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>and if you do not take it to heart</b><br>Taking something to heart implies internalizing and valuing it deeply. The heart in Hebrew thought is the center of will and decision-making. This phrase suggests a failure to internalize God's commands, which is a recurring issue in Israel's history (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>to honor My name,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts,</b><br>Honoring God's name involves reverence and worship, acknowledging His holiness and authority. The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power over all creation. This call to honor God is central to the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and reflects the failure of the priests in Malachi's time to uphold God's honor.<p><b>&#8220;I will send a curse among you,</b><br>Curses in the Old Testament are consequences of covenant disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). This reflects the conditional nature of the Mosaic Covenant, where blessings and curses were contingent on Israel's obedience.<p><b>and I will curse your blessings.</b><br>Blessings, often material or spiritual, were signs of God's favor. The reversal of blessings into curses indicates a severe divine judgment. This echoes the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings for obedience are contrasted with curses for disobedience.<p><b>Yes, I have already begun to curse them,</b><br>This indicates that the process of judgment had already started. It serves as a warning and a call to repentance. The historical context suggests that the post-exilic community was experiencing difficulties, which Malachi attributes to their unfaithfulness.<p><b>because you are not taking it to heart.</b><br>Reiterating the earlier phrase, this underscores the root issue: a lack of genuine commitment and reverence for God. The repetition highlights the seriousness of the charge and the need for heartfelt repentance. This theme of heart transformation is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of inner purity (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message to the Israelites.

God never grants the option of selective hearing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>; <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). Like parents who expect a child to heed instructions, the LORD expects His priests&#8212;and by extension His people&#8212;to obey fully. When we drift into passive disregard, we forfeit promised favor (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If you do not take it to heart</b><p>To &#8220;take it to heart&#8221; moves truth from the ears to the core of our being (<a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20-22</a>). Intellectual assent without heartfelt embrace will not satisfy God (<a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>). He looks for affection that fuels obedience, not casual acknowledgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To honor My name,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts</b><p>Honoring His name means treating His person, character, and reputation as weighty (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>). The priests were offering blemished sacrifices (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-8</a>), making worship cheap. By addressing Himself as &#8220;the LORD of Hosts,&#8221; God reminds them He commands angelic armies; such a King must never be approached lightly (<a href="/psalms/24-9.htm">Psalm 24:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will send a curse among you</b><p>Covenant blessing and cursing are two sides of the same promise (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-16</a>). When God&#8217;s people reject His terms, He actively opposes them. This is no impersonal consequence but a deliberate act of justice meant to awaken repentance (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will curse your blessings</b><p>Even the priests&#8217; &#8220;blessings&#8221; (their pronouncements over the people, or the good things they enjoyed) would invert into harm (<a href="/haggai/1-9.htm">Haggai 1:9-11</a>). God can transform prosperity into emptiness, health into frailty, and abundance into lack (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-45.htm">Deuteronomy 28:45</a>). Blessings are never autonomous; they depend on ongoing fidelity (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have already begun to curse them</b><p>The process was underway.

Until the heart bows, every religious act is hollow (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-2.htm">Revelation 3:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/malachi/2-2.htm">Malachi 2:2</a> exposes a chain reaction: failure to listen &#10141; failure to value God&#8217;s honor &#10141; divine curse that overturns even good gifts. The verse calls every believer to wholehearted reverence. When God&#8217;s name is prized, blessings flow; when it is slighted, blessings sour. Taking His Word to heart is not optional&#8212;it is the dividing line between life and loss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/malachi/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Hear . . . lay to heart</span>--viz., the warning of <a href="/context/malachi/1-6.htm" title="A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? said the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And you say, Wherein have we despised your name?">Malachi 1:6-13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Your blessings.</span>--Some take this as meaning the priests' tithes, atonement money, and their portions of the sacrifices, in accordance with a common usage of the word in the sense of "gift"--<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/genesis/33-11.htm" title="Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.">Genesis 33:11</a>. Others refer the words to the blessing which the priests pronounce on the people (<a href="/context/numbers/6-23.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,">Numbers 6:23-27</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will even send a curse;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">then will I send the curse.</span> St. Jerome, regarding the temporal effect of the curse, translates, <span class="accented">egestatem</span> "scarcity" (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I will curse your blessings</span>. The blessings which as priests they had to pronounce upon the people (<a href="/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22, 23</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23-27</a>). These God would not ratify, but would turn them into curses, and thus punish the people who connived at and imitated the iniquities of the priests. Or the expression may refer to the material benefits promised by God to the Israelites on their obedience. But as the announcement is made specially to the priests, this explanation seems less probable. <span class="cmt_word">I have cursed them already.</span> The curse has already begun to work. Dr. S. Cox ('Bible Educator,' 3:67, etc.) points out here an allusion to <a href="/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1, 2</a>, wherein it is recorded that they reed from the Book of Moses how that the Moabites "hired Balsam against them that he should curse them; howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing." Malachi, who, as he thinks, was present on this occasion, may have been deeply impressed by these words; and it is probable that we hear an echo of them in the threat of ver. 2. "That of old God had turned a curse into a blessing, may have suggested the menace that he would now turn a blessing into a curse." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/malachi/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">listen,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1441;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;i&#353;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
