In the context of Malachi, the Israelites are returning from exile and are disillusioned with their circumstances, leading them to question God's justice and faithfulness. This weariness reflects a broader biblical theme where God is patient but can be grieved by persistent unbelief and disobedience, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a> and <a href="/psalms/95-10.htm">Psalm 95:10</a>.<p><b>yet you ask, &#8220;How have we wearied Him?&#8221;</b><br>The people's response shows a lack of self-awareness and understanding of their spiritual condition. This rhetorical question highlights their ignorance or denial of their own sinfulness. It echoes the attitude of self-righteousness found in other parts of Scripture, such as in the Pharisees' interactions with Jesus (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>), where they fail to recognize their own hypocrisy.<p><b>By saying, &#8220;All who do evil are good in the sight of the LORD, and in them He delights,&#8221;</b><br>This accusation against the people suggests a moral inversion, where they claim that God approves of evil deeds. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's character, as He is holy and just (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). The Israelites' perception may have been influenced by their difficult circumstances, leading them to doubt God's justice. This mirrors the complaint in <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>, where the prophet questions why God tolerates wrongdoing.<p><b>or, &#8220;Where is the God of justice?&#8221;</b><br>This question challenges God's presence and His role as a just judge. It reflects a common biblical theme where people question God's justice in the face of apparent prosperity of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-12</a>. The Israelites' impatience for divine intervention reveals their limited understanding of God's timing and justice, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who embodies perfect justice and righteousness (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is being wearied by the people's words and attitudes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The audience of Malachi's prophecy, who are questioning God's justice and expressing cynicism about His moral governance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet delivering God's message, addressing the spiritual and moral decline of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_evildoers.htm">The Evildoers</a></b><br>Those whom the people claim are seen as good in the sight of the LORD, reflecting a misunderstanding of God's justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_concept_of_justice.htm">The Concept of Justice</a></b><br>A central theme in this verse, highlighting the people's doubt about God's righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_patience.htm">Understanding God's Patience</a></b><br>God's delay in judgment is not approval of sin but an opportunity for repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_cynicism.htm">The Danger of Cynicism</a></b><br>Questioning God's justice can lead to spiritual weariness and moral compromise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faith_in_god's_justice.htm">The Importance of Faith in God's Justice</a></b><br>Trust in God's ultimate justice, even when it seems delayed, is crucial for maintaining faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_our_words.htm">Guarding Our Words</a></b><br>Our words reflect our heart's condition; we must speak in faith and truth, not in doubt and cynicism.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_sovereignty.htm">Recognizing God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Acknowledge that God's ways and timing are perfect, even when they are beyond our understanding.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Malachi_2_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Malachi 2:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Malachi_2_17_Rethink_God_s_justice.htm">How does Malachi 2:17 challenge us to examine our view of God's justice?

Just as parents become exhausted by constant excuses, God grows weary when His people keep talking about faith yet refuse to live it.<p>&#8226; Their sacrifices sounded pious, but their hearts were self-focused (<a href="/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; James later echoes this: &#8220;From the same mouth come blessing and cursing&#8230; these things ought not to be so&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-10.htm">James 3:10</a>).<p>When worship turns into mere words, it drains the joy out of the relationship and offends the holiness of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet you ask, &#8220;How have we wearied Him?&#8221;</b><p>The people claim ignorance, revealing spiritual blindness.

THE ADVENT OF THE LORD FORETOLD (<a href="/malachi/2-17.htm" title="You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, Wherein have we wearied him? When you say, Every one that does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?">Malachi 2:17</a> to <a href="/malachi/3-18.htm" title="Then shall you return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that serves him not.">Malachi 3:18</a>).</span><p>(17) A new section of the prophecy begins with this verse. The prophet now directs his reproofs against the people for their discontent and their want of faith in the promises of God, because the expected manifestation of God's glory did not take place immediately. Because the doers of evil seem to flourish, the people say that God takes delight in them, "or" <span class= "ital">i.e., if this be not the case, </span>"Where is the God of judgment?" that He does not interpose to punish them.

The prophet makes his charge. The faithless multitude have, as it were, worn out God's patience by their murmuring and discontent. Because their expectations of prosperity and glory were not at once fulfilled, they called in question God's justice and holiness, and even the future judgment.
