In the Old Testament, God is often referred to as the Father of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). This concept underscores the unity and equality among the people, as they all descend from the same divine source. The fatherhood of God also implies a relationship of care, authority, and responsibility, which the Israelites are expected to honor.<p><b>Did not one God create us?</b><br>This statement reaffirms the monotheistic belief central to Israelite faith, distinguishing them from surrounding polytheistic cultures. It echoes <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where God creates humanity in His image, establishing the inherent dignity and worth of every person. The creation by one God implies a shared purpose and destiny, calling the Israelites to live in harmony and obedience to their Creator.<p><b>Why then do we break faith with one another</b><br>Breaking faith refers to acts of betrayal or unfaithfulness, particularly in the context of covenant relationships. In Malachi's time, this included issues like divorce and social injustice, which violated the community's covenantal obligations. The prophets frequently addressed such breaches, urging a return to faithfulness (<a href="/hosea/4.htm">Hosea 4:1-2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/5.htm">Jeremiah 5:1-2</a>). This phrase challenges the Israelites to examine their actions and restore integrity in their relationships.<p><b>so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?</b><br>The covenant of the fathers refers to the agreements God made with the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;and later with the nation of Israel at Sinai. Profaning the covenant means treating it with disrespect or irreverence, often through disobedience or idolatry. This phrase highlights the seriousness of covenant violations, which not only harm interpersonal relationships but also dishonor the sacred commitments made with God. The call is to uphold the covenant faithfully, reflecting God's holiness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The last prophet in the Old Testament, Malachi addresses the spiritual and moral decay of the Israelites after their return from exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have returned from Babylonian exile and are struggling with faithfulness to God's covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_of_the_fathers.htm">Covenant of the Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the covenant God made with the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob) and later with Moses at Sinai, emphasizing faithfulness and obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/one_father.htm">One Father</a></b><br>A reference to God as the Father of all, highlighting the unity and shared heritage of the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/profaning_the_covenant.htm">Profaning the Covenant</a></b><br>The act of breaking faith with God and each other, which is seen as a serious violation of their relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_creation.htm">Unity in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that all humans are created by one God, which calls us to treat each other with respect and dignity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_the_covenant.htm">Faithfulness to the Covenant</a></b><br>Understand the importance of remaining faithful to God's covenant, which includes loving and serving one another.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/breaking_faith.htm">Breaking Faith</a></b><br>Reflect on how breaking faith with others is a serious offense that dishonors God and damages community relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_father.htm">God as Father</a></b><br>Embrace the concept of God as our Father, which unites us as a family and calls us to live in harmony.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_the_covenant.htm">Living the Covenant</a></b><br>Apply the principles of the covenant in daily life by being trustworthy, loving, and committed to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Malachi_2_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Malachi 2:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Malachi_2_10_God_s_role_as_Father.htm">How does Malachi 2:10 emphasize God's role as our common Father and Creator?

Whenever believers betray that trust&#8212;through injustice, broken promises, or relational treachery&#8212;they insult the very God who made and fathered them.

He introduces this rebuke by a general statement, similar to that of <a href="/malachi/1-2.htm" title="I have loved you, said the LORD. Yet you say, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? said the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,">Malachi 1:2</a>.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">One father</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> not Adam, Abraham, or Jacob (as various commentators have held), but God Himself (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm" title="A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? said the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name.

Moreover, "one God created" them for His glory (<a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm" title="Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yes, I have made him.">Isaiah 43:7</a>), for the special purpose of being a witness to His unity. The admission of idolatresses into their families would be fatal to this object. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-16</span> - Part II. CONDEMNATION OF PRIESTS AND PEOPLE FOR ALIEN MARRIAGES AND FOR DIVORCES. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have we not all one Father?</span> In proceeding to his new subject, the violations of the law of marriage, the prophet pursues his habitual method. He starts with a general principle, here assuming an interrogative form, and on it builds his rebuke. The priests were guilty, if not of profane marriages, at any rate of sinful neglect in not warning the people against them. Many take the "one father" to be Abraham (<a href="/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>), and it is no objection to this view that he was also the progenitor of Ishmaelites, Edomites, etc., because there was at this time no question about marriage with these nations, but with Canaanites, Moabites, Egyptians, and so on. But the parallelism with the following clause shows that by the Father is meant Almighty God (comp. <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath not one God created us?</span> Hath not God taken us as his peculiar people, so as to call us his sons and his firstborn (comp. <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22, 23</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a>)? Of course, God created all men; but the Jews alone recognized him as Creator. The prophet's proposition is that all Israelites were spiritual brothers and sisters, equally loved and chosen by God. From this he argues that in sinning against one another, they offended their common Father, and broke the family compact. <span class="cmt_word">Deal treacherously.</span> Act faithlessly against one another. He does not yet say in what this treachery consists, but adds, <span class="cmt_word">by profaning the covenant of our fathers</span>. He unites himself with them, because he suffered in their sin. They violated the covenant by which God chose them to be his peculiar people and placed himself in mysterious relation to them, on condition that they should keep themselves aloof from the evil nations around them, and avoid all connection with them and their practices. By intermarriages with the heathen, they profaned this covenant. This evil was one which Ezra had done his best to eradicate, using most stringent measures for its suppression (<a href="/ezra/9.htm">Ezra 9, 10</a>.); Nehemiah, too, contended against those who had contracted these marriages, when he found on his return to Jerusalem many such transgressors (<a href="/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23-28</a>); and now the prophet lifts up his voice in the cause of purity and obedience.
