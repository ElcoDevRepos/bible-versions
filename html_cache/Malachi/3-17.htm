The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores His supreme authority and command over heavenly armies, indicating His power to fulfill His promises. This echoes the covenant language found in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>, where God claims Israel as His treasured possession if they obey His voice. It reflects the intimate relationship God desires with His people, akin to a king claiming his subjects.<p><b>&#8220;on the day when I prepare My treasured possession.&#8221;</b><br>The "day" refers to a future time of divine intervention and judgment, often associated with the Day of the Lord in prophetic literature. "Treasured possession" is a term used in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a> to describe Israel's unique status among the nations. This phrase suggests a time of purification and selection, where God will distinguish those who are truly His. It implies a process of preparation, akin to refining, where God sets apart His people for Himself.<p><b>And I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.</b><br>This imagery of sparing a son highlights the familial relationship between God and His people, reminiscent of the father-son relationship seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a>. It suggests mercy and compassion, contrasting with the judgment reserved for the wicked. The reference to a son who serves implies obedience and faithfulness, drawing a parallel to the faithful remnant who remain true to God. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, the ultimate Son who serves the Father perfectly, providing a model for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly armies.
