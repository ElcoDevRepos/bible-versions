Historically, these offerings were central to the worship practices in the temple, which was located in Jerusalem. The mention of both Judah and Jerusalem emphasizes the collective responsibility and participation of the entire community in worship. The offerings symbolize the people's devotion and obedience to God, and their restoration signifies a return to proper worship practices. This restoration is often seen as a result of purification and repentance, aligning with the prophetic call for renewal and faithfulness.<p><b>will please the LORD</b><br>The idea of offerings pleasing the LORD suggests a return to genuine worship and righteousness. In the context of Malachi, the prophet criticizes the priests and people for their insincere and corrupt practices. The pleasing offerings indicate a transformation where the people's hearts and actions align with God's standards. This phrase echoes the biblical theme that God desires obedience and sincerity over mere ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>). It also points to a future time when worship will be restored to its intended purity and purpose.<p><b>as in days of old and years gone by</b><br>This phrase evokes a longing for a return to the faithful worship practices of Israel's past. It suggests a time when the people were more aligned with God's covenant and their offerings were made with sincerity and devotion. Historically, this could refer to periods such as the reigns of David and Solomon, when the temple worship was established and the nation was united in its devotion to God. The phrase also carries a prophetic hope for a future restoration, where the community's relationship with God is renewed and strengthened. This longing for a return to former glory is a common theme in the prophetic literature, pointing to a messianic age of renewal and peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The last prophet in the Old Testament, whose name means "my messenger."
