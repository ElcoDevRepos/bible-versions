Some scholars suggest that Lemuel might be a symbolic or poetic name, possibly referring to Solomon or another Israelite king. The name "Lemuel" means "devoted to God," which aligns with the biblical theme of kingship under divine authority. This introduction sets the stage for a passage that is unique in its attribution to a king, emphasizing the importance of wisdom and instruction from a royal perspective.<p><b>the burden that his mother taught him:</b><br>The term "burden" here can be understood as a weighty message or oracle, indicating the seriousness and importance of the teaching. The fact that this wisdom comes from Lemuel's mother highlights the significant role of women in imparting wisdom and moral guidance, a theme that resonates throughout Proverbs. This maternal instruction underscores the biblical principle of honoring one's parents and valuing their guidance (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>, <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>). The cultural context of the time placed great importance on oral tradition and familial instruction, making this passage a testament to the enduring influence of parental teaching. The mother's role here can also be seen as a type of the Holy Spirit, who instructs and guides believers in truth and wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_lemuel.htm">King Lemuel</a></b><br>A king whose identity is not clearly defined in the Bible.

God often speaks through unexpected figures (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>- Other royal collections in Scripture (<a href="/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a>) show that a king&#8217;s testimony can serve the entire covenant community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the burden</b><p>- A &#8220;burden&#8221; is a weighty utterance&#8212;something carried because it must be delivered (<a href="/malachi/1-1.htm">Malachi 1:1</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>).<p>- It carries moral gravity: this is not casual advice but an imperative from God, meant to shape the conscience (<a href="/jeremiah/23-33.htm">Jeremiah 23:33-36</a>).<p>- For a king, embracing this burden means ruling under God&#8217;s higher authority, submitting crown to Creator (<a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that his mother taught him:</b><p>- The passage highlights a mother&#8217;s lifelong influence, fulfilling God&#8217;s design for parents to instruct children (<a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>; 6:20; <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).<p>- Her teaching proves that wisdom is often first learned in the home before it is exercised in public office (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>- The verse also elevates godly womanhood, anticipating the famous portrait of the virtuous wife later in the chapter (<a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a> introduces a king who humbly records the weighty lesson his mother gave him.

"Lemuel," which most likely signifies (dedicated) "to God," has been, like Agur, supposed to be a designation of Solomon, but with no good reason.<p><span class= "bld">The prophecy that his mother taught him.--</span>Mothers were looked upon with great veneration in the East. (Comp. <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm" title="My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:">Proverbs 1:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-20.htm" title="My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:">Proverbs 6:20</a>.) The mothers of kings especially were treated with marked respect, receiving the title of "queen-mother." (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm" title="Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.">1Kings 2:19</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm" title="And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.">1Kings 15:13</a>.)

SECOND APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION, containing "the words of Lemuel" on the subjects of impurity and intemperance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">superscription. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The words of King Lemuel, the prophecy which his mother taught him.</span> Who is intended by "Lemuel king" is much disputed. Those who connect the following word <span class="accented">massa</span> ("oracle") with the preceding <span class="accented">melek</span> ("king"), translate "King of Massa," as <a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a> (where see note). Of the country, or the king, or his mother, we have absolutely no information. The name Lemuel, or Lemoel (ver. 4), means "unto God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dedicated to God, like Lael (<a href="/numbers/3-24.htm">Numbers 3:24</a>); hence it is regarded by many authorities, ancient and modern, as an appellation of Solomon, one from infancy dedicated to God and celled by him Jedidiah, "beloved of the Lord" (<a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>). But there is nothing in the contents of this section to confirm this idea; indeed, there are expressions which militate against it. Possibly Hezekiah may be meant, and his remarkable piety somewhat confirms the opinion; yet we see no reason why he should be here addressed under a pseudonym, especially if we consider that he himself was concerned in making this collection. On the whole, it seems best to take Lemuel as a symbolical name, designating an ideal king, to whom an ideal mother addressed the exhortation which follows. Solomon's own proverbs contain many warnings against the very sins of which this mother speaks, so that the section is conceived in the spirit of the earlier portion of the book, though it is assigned to a different author and another age. <span class="accented">The prophecy</span> (<span class="accented">massa</span>); the inspired utterance (see on ch. 30:1). This maternal counsel forms one compact exhortation, which might with more propriety be so termed than the words of Agur. <span class="accented">His mother.</span> The mother of a reigning king was always regarded with the utmost respect, taking precedence of the king's wife. Hence we so often find the names of kings' mothers in the sacred record; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>. It is difficult to say what reading was seen by the LXX., who render, "My words have been spoken by God, the oracle of a king whom his mother instructed." There are many wise women mentioned in Scripture; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Miriam, Deborah, the Queen of Sheba, Huldah, etc., so there is nothing incongruous in Lemuel being instructed by his mother in wisdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/31-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1453;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#7687;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1425;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Lemuel&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3927.htm">Strong's 3927: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lemuel -- king of Massa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an oracle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1437;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4853.htm">Strong's 4853: </a> </span><span class="str2">A burden, tribute, porterage, an utterance, chiefly a, doom, singing, mental, desire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#8205;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his mother</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_517.htm">Strong's 517: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, )</span><br /><br /><span class="word">taught him:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yis&#183;s&#601;&#183;rat&#183;t&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person feminine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3256.htm">Strong's 3256: </a> </span><span class="str2">To discipline, chasten, admonish</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 31:1 The words of king Lemuel (Prov.
