In biblical context, the "fruit of his lips" suggests that what a person speaks can lead to tangible outcomes, much like how a tree bears fruit. Proverbs often highlights the importance of wise and righteous speech (<a href="/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>, <a href="/proverbs/18-20.htm">Proverbs 18:20-21</a>). The idea is that words can produce positive results, such as peace, prosperity, and favor. In the New Testament, <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a> discusses the power of the tongue, reinforcing the idea that speech can have significant consequences. The "good things" enjoyed by a man can be seen as blessings or rewards that come from speaking truthfully and wisely, aligning with the biblical principle that righteousness leads to life and prosperity (<a href="/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>).<p><b>but the desire of the faithless is violence</b><br>This part contrasts the outcomes of the righteous and the wicked. The "faithless" refers to those who lack fidelity to God and His commandments. In biblical terms, faithlessness often leads to moral decay and destructive behavior. The "desire" of such individuals is inclined towards violence, indicating a heart that is not aligned with God's will. This reflects the broader biblical theme that wickedness leads to chaos and destruction (<a href="/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel, where community and covenant faithfulness were paramount, underscores the severity of being faithless. The contrast between the outcomes of the righteous and the wicked is a recurring theme in Proverbs, illustrating the moral order established by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

By his kindly speech and wise counsels he shall gain the good will of his neighbours and the blessing of God. Schultens observes that the word rendered "good" (<span class="accented">tob</span>) means what is pleasant to taste and smell, while that translated "violence" (<span class="accented">chamas</span>) signifies literally what is crude and unripe. <span class="cmt_word">The soul of the transgressors shall eat violence</span> (<a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>). The Authorized Version introduces the verb from the first clause unnecessarily. The meaning of this rendering is that sinners, especially the treacherous, bring on themselves retribution; the injuries which they devise against others recoil on their own heads (<a href="/proverbs/10-6.htm">Proverbs 10:6</a>). The Hebrew is, "The soul (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the desire, or delight) of the perfidious (is) violence." Such men have only one thing at heart, viz. to wrong their neighbour, and to increase their own property by any, even nefarious, precedings.
