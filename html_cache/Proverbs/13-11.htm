In biblical context, dishonest wealth refers to money or possessions gained through deceit, theft, or unethical practices. The Bible consistently condemns such actions, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2</a>, which states that "ill-gotten treasures have no lasting value." The historical context of ancient Israel included strict laws against dishonest gain, such as those found in <a href="/leviticus/19-11.htm">Leviticus 19:11-13</a>, which prohibited stealing and deceit. The cultural understanding was that wealth obtained through unrighteous means would not be blessed by God and would ultimately lead to ruin, as echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>, where it is said that those who gain riches unjustly will leave them in the midst of their days. This principle is timeless, emphasizing the moral and spiritual decay that accompanies dishonest gain.<p><b>but what is earned through hard work will be multiplied</b><br>This phrase highlights the value of diligence and integrity in acquiring wealth. The Bible frequently praises hard work and the rewards it brings, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11</a>, which states, "Those who work their land will have abundant food." The cultural context of the ancient Near East placed a high value on labor and the fruits it produced, often seen as a sign of God's blessing. The principle of sowing and reaping is evident here, where honest labor leads to prosperity and multiplication, as also reflected in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>, which speaks to reaping what one sows. This concept is not only practical but also spiritual, as it aligns with the character of God, who is just and rewards those who live righteously. The multiplication of wealth through hard work can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, through His labor and sacrifice, brought about the multiplication of spiritual blessings for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
