In ancient Israel, vows were serious promises made to God, often involving sacrifices or offerings (<a href="/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27:1-8</a>). The cultural context emphasizes the importance of thoughtful deliberation before making such commitments. The term "trap" suggests a snare or pitfall, indicating the potential spiritual and practical consequences of rash decisions. This aligns with <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which advises fulfilling vows promptly and not making them lightly. The concept of rashness is also seen in the story of Jephthah (<a href="/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30-31, 34</a>-35), whose hasty vow led to personal tragedy.<p><b>only later to reconsider his vows</b><br>Reconsidering vows implies a change of heart or regret after making a commitment. In biblical times, vows were binding and breaking them was considered sinful (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). This phrase highlights the human tendency to act impulsively and the subsequent realization of the weight of one's promises. The historical context underscores the gravity of vows, as they were not only personal commitments but also public declarations of faithfulness to God. Jesus addresses the issue of oaths in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, urging honesty and integrity without the need for elaborate promises. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sincerity in one's relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>, which praises those who keep their promises even when it is difficult.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Here the snare lies in our own words. What feels harmless in the moment can suddenly bind us, much like the &#8220;thorns and snares&#8221; set before the wayward (<a href="/proverbs/22-5.htm">Proverbs 22:5</a>). Recognizing that hidden peril invites us to slow down, pray, and weigh our promises before speaking.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for a man to dedicate something rashly</b><p>To &#8220;dedicate&#8221; is to set something apart for God&#8217;s use&#8212;time, money, possessions, even ourselves. The problem surfaces when the dedication is rash, impulsive, or emotion-driven.<p>&#8226; Jephthah&#8217;s tragic vow in <a href="/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30-35</a> illustrates the pain of hasty words.<p>&#8226; God anticipated such impulsiveness and provided guidelines in <a href="/leviticus/27-1.htm">Leviticus 27:1-13</a>, showing He takes vows seriously.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/19-2.htm">Proverbs 19:2</a> cautions, &#8220;Enthusiasm without knowledge is not good,&#8221; reminding us that zeal must be guided by wisdom.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a> urges, &#8220;When you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not delay to pay it,&#8221; underscoring that God expects follow-through, not spur-of-the-moment pledges.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>only later to reconsider his vows</b><p>The snare tightens when regret sets in. Once the words are out, the promise stands (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). Second thoughts do not dissolve the obligation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a> warns that delaying or reneging on vows offends God and invites ruin.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a> praises the person &#8220;who keeps his oath, even when it hurts,&#8221; highlighting integrity over convenience.<p>&#8226; Jesus upholds the same standard, urging straightforward honesty over elaborate oaths (<a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>).<p>Looking back with remorse is avoidable when we first look ahead with discernment.

Hasty promises spring from impulse, not discernment, and quickly become snares when reality sets in. Scripture calls us to measured speech, thoughtful dedication, and unwavering follow-through. By pausing to seek God&#8217;s wisdom before we vow, we avoid the trap and walk in integrity that honors Him and blesses those around us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">It is a snare to a man who devoureth that which is holy.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">It is a snare for a man </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>gets him into trouble) <span class= "ital">rashly to say, </span>"<span class= "ital">It is dedicated" </span>(i.e., when he thoughtlessly dedicates anything to God), <span class= "ital">and after he has vowed to enquire </span>(whether he can keep his word).

The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Ruina est homini devorare sanctos</span>, which is explained to mean that it is destruction for a man to persecute the saints of God. But the word <span class="accented">devorare</span> is not certain, as the manuscripts vary between this and four other readings, viz. <span class="accented">devotares, denotare, devovere</span>, and <span class="accented">devocare.</span> The Authorized Version signifies that it is a sin to take for one's own consumption things dedicated to God, as firstfruits, the priests' portions, etc.: or a man's snare, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his covetousness (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), leads him to commit sacrilege.

The clause will then run, "It is a snare to a man rashly to cry, Holiness!" equivalent to "It is holy!" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to use the formula for consecrating something to holy purposes. Septuagint, "It is a snare to a man hastily to consecrate something of his own" (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2, 4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And after vows to make inquiry;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after he has made his vow, to begin to consider whether he can fulfil it or not.
