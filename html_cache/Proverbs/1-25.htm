In the biblical context, "counsel" refers to the advice and instruction given by God through His Word and His prophets. The Israelites often ignored God's counsel, leading to their downfall, as seen in the history of the kings of Israel and Judah. This neglect is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God's people are warned against ignoring His commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-20</a>). The wisdom literature, including Proverbs, emphasizes the importance of heeding God's counsel for a prosperous and righteous life (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The rejection of divine counsel is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus laments over Jerusalem for not recognizing the time of God's coming to them (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>).<p><b>and wanted none of my correction</b><br>This phrase underscores the refusal to accept discipline and correction from God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, correction was seen as a necessary part of growth and maturity, both spiritually and morally. The Hebrew word for correction can also mean discipline or chastisement, which is intended for the betterment of the individual (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>). The refusal to accept correction is akin to pride and stubbornness, traits that are condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The Bible often portrays God as a loving Father who disciplines His children for their good (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>). This refusal to accept correction is a rejection of God's love and a failure to recognize His authority. In the New Testament, Jesus' call to repentance is a form of correction, urging people to turn from their ways and follow Him (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
