In the context of <a href="/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9</a>, this woman represents folly, contrasting with wisdom, who also calls out to passersby. The imagery of sitting at the door suggests a position of authority and readiness to engage with those who pass by. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the door of a house was a place of social interaction and decision-making. This setting implies that folly is accessible and inviting, waiting to ensnare those who are not discerning. The door symbolizes a threshold, a point of decision where one must choose between wisdom and folly.<p><b>on a seat in the heights of the city</b><br>The "heights of the city" refers to a prominent and visible location, often associated with places of worship or significant public gatherings in ancient cities. This positioning indicates that folly is not hidden but rather openly displayed and easily accessible to all. The seat suggests a place of judgment or teaching, similar to how elders would sit at the city gates to render decisions. This imagery contrasts with the call of wisdom, who also positions herself in high places to be heard by all. The heights symbolize the pervasive nature of folly, as it seeks to influence and dominate the cultural and spiritual landscape. This setting serves as a warning to the reader about the allure and danger of choosing the path of folly over the path of wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_folly.htm">The Woman Folly</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9</a>, the woman described is often referred to as "Folly."
