The act of taking a garment as security indicates a serious commitment to repay a debt. This phrase warns against the imprudence of guaranteeing a loan for someone unknown or untrustworthy. The Bible frequently advises caution in financial dealings, emphasizing wisdom and discernment (<a href="/proverbs/6.htm">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>). The garment symbolizes personal responsibility and the potential consequences of rash decisions. This principle reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship and accountability.<p><b>get collateral if it is for a foreigner.</b><br>The mention of a "foreigner" highlights the increased risk involved in financial transactions with those outside one's community. In the ancient Near East, foreigners were often seen as outsiders with different customs and legal protections, making transactions with them more precarious. This advice underscores the importance of securing one's interests when dealing with unfamiliar parties. The Bible often addresses the treatment of foreigners, advocating for justice and fairness (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>), yet it also acknowledges the practical need for caution in business matters.

someone you do not know. In ancient Israel, a garment could be pledged as down-payment (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>), so &#8220;take the garment&#8221; pictures insisting on tangible security before entering the arrangement.<p>&#8211; Scripture repeatedly cautions that guaranteeing another person&#8217;s debt exposes you to loss (<a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>; 11:15).<p>&#8211; Wisdom here is protective, not punitive: if the borrower defaults, the guarantor&#8212;who offered to stand in&#8212;must feel the weight of responsibility he accepted. Tangible collateral helps ensure accountability, discouraging careless promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>get collateral if it is for a foreigner</b><p>&#8211; The term &#8220;foreigner&#8221; points to someone outside one&#8217;s close community, whose reliability is harder to verify. Moses allowed lending to outsiders with interest while forbidding it among Israelites (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>), acknowledging the different level of trust.<p>&#8211; Requiring collateral when the borrower is distant or unknown is simply prudent stewardship. Jesus tells us to be &#8220;wise as serpents&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), and Paul urges believers to &#8220;owe no one anything&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8</a>).<p>&#8211; Practical take-aways:<p>&#8226; Do not obligate your family&#8217;s resources for people whose character you cannot assess.<p>&#8226; When generosity is appropriate, give rather than guarantee, so you are not ensnared by another&#8217;s failure (<a href="/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; A pledge should match the risk; even friendly loans benefit from clear terms and accountability (<a href="/bsb/philemon/1.htm">Philemon 18</a>-19).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16</a> offers timeless counsel: safeguard your resources by requiring real security before shouldering another&#8217;s debt, especially when the borrower is outside your circle of trust. God&#8217;s Word prizes compassion, yet it pairs compassion with responsibility, urging believers to exercise discernment so that generosity does not become entanglement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Take his garment that is surety for a stranger.</span>--Another warning against suretiship. (See above on <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm" title="My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,">Proverbs 6:1</a>.) If a man is rash enough to become surety for another, he must suffer for his imprudence, and learn wisdom by feeling the effects of his folly.<p><span class= "bld">And take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">take him as a pledge </span>(seize upon his person who has become surety) <span class= "ital">for a strange woman, </span>(according to the margin) or, <span class= "ital">for strangers </span>(as the text reads).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take his garment that is surety for a stranger.</span> The maxim is repeated in <a href="/proverbs/27-13.htm">Proverbs 27:13</a>; and warnings against suretyship are found in <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>, etc.; Proverbs 11:15; 17:18; 22:26, etc. The second portion of the clause is translated also, "For he is surety for another." If a man is so weak and foolish as to become security for any one, and is unable to make good his engaged payment, let him lose his garment which the creditor would seize; his imprudence must bring its own punishment. <span class="cmt_word">And take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</span> The Authorized Version probably adopts this rendering in conformity with <a href="/proverbs/27-13.htm">Proverbs 27:13</a>, where it occurs in the text, as here in the margin (the Keri). But the Khetib has, "for strangers," which seems to be the original reading; and the first words ought to be translated, "hold him in pledge;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> seize his person for the sake of the strangers for whom he has stood security, so as not to suffer loss from them. The Law endeavoured to secure lending to needy brethren without interest (see <a href="/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8, 13</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 22:12): but it allowed the creditor to secure himself by taking pledges of his debtor, while it regulated this system so as to obviate most of its severity and oppressiveness (see the restrictions in <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26</a>, etc.; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6, 12</a>, etc.). "Where the debtor possessed nothing which he could pledge, he gave the personal security of a friend. This was a very formal proceeding. The surety gave his hand both to the debtor and to the creditor before an assembly legally convened, he deposited a pledge, and, in accordance with this twofold promise, was regarded by the creditor in just the same light as the debtor himself, and treated accordingly. If the debtor, or in his place the surety, was unable to pay the debt when it fell due, he was entirely at the mercy of the creditor. The authorities troubled themselves but little about these relations, and the law, so far as it is preserved to us, gave no directions in the matter. We see, however, from many allusions and narratives, what harsh forms these relations actually took, especially in later times, when the ancient national brotherly love which the Law presupposed was more and more dying out. The creditor could not only forcibly appropriate all the movable, but also the fixed property, including the hereditary estate (this at least till its redemption in the year of jubilee), nay, he could even (if he could find nothing else of value) carry off as a prisoner the body of his debtor, or of his wife and child, to employ them in his service, though this could only he done for a definite period" (Ewald, 'Antiquities,' p. 184, etc., transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/20-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1469;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;qa&#7717;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the garment</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1453;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7713;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
