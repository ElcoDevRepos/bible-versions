In ancient Near Eastern culture, the wind was often seen as a powerful and uncontrollable force, much like in the story of Jesus calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). The wind's unpredictability and strength make it an apt comparison for the challenges faced when dealing with a difficult person. The imagery suggests that just as one cannot capture or direct the wind, so too is it impossible to change the nature of someone who is determined to be contentious. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of the heart's stubbornness, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which speaks to the deceitful nature of the human heart.<p><b>Or grasping oil with one&#8217;s right hand</b><br>Oil in biblical times was a valuable commodity, used for anointing, cooking, and as a symbol of blessing and abundance (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>). The right hand is often associated with strength and skill (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>), yet even with one's strongest effort, oil slips through the fingers, illustrating the impossibility of the task. This metaphor highlights the elusive and slippery nature of trying to manage or control a quarrelsome person. The imagery of oil also connects to the anointing of kings and priests, pointing to the idea that some things are beyond human control and require divine intervention. This can be seen in the anointing of David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), where God's choice and empowerment were necessary for leadership. The futility of grasping oil underscores the need for wisdom and discernment in relationships, as emphasized throughout the book of Proverbs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

He might as well try to hide the ointment which signifies its presence by its odour. But there is no "which" in the original, which runs literally, "his right hand calls oil," or, "oil meets his right hand." The former is supposed to mean that he is hurt in the struggle to coerce the vixen, and needs ointment to heal his wound; but the latter seems the correct rendering, and the meaning then is that, if he tries to hold or stop his wife, she escapes him like the oil which you try in vain to keep in your hand. An old adage says that there are three things which cannot be hidden, but always betray themselves, viz. a woman, the wind, and ointment.
