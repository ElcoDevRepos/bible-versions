In the context of <a href="/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9</a>, this is part of the depiction of Folly, personified as a woman, who seeks to entice the simple and those lacking judgment. The act of "calling out" indicates a public and open invitation, similar to Wisdom's call earlier in the chapter. This reflects the cultural practice of public announcements in ancient cities, where the city gates or marketplaces were common places for such proclamations. Biblically, this can be contrasted with the call of Wisdom, which is also public but leads to life and understanding (<a href="/proverbs/8.htm">Proverbs 8:1-4</a>). Theologically, it highlights the constant presence of competing voices in the world, each vying for attention and allegiance.<p><b>who make their paths straight</b><br>This phrase refers to individuals who are attempting to live righteously and with purpose. In biblical terms, making one's path straight is often associated with living according to God's commandments and seeking His guidance (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The imagery of a straight path is used throughout Scripture to denote a life of integrity and obedience (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>). Historically, straight paths were preferred for travel and trade, symbolizing efficiency and directness. In the context of <a href="/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9</a>, those who "make their paths straight" are targeted by Folly, indicating that even those with good intentions can be led astray if they are not vigilant. This serves as a warning to believers to remain steadfast and discerning, aligning with the broader biblical theme of the narrow path that leads to life (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_and_folly.htm">Wisdom and Folly</a></b><br>Proverbs 9 contrasts the personifications of Wisdom and Folly. Wisdom is depicted as a woman who has built her house and prepared a feast, inviting people to partake in her banquet.

The Fathers find here a picture of the seductions of heretical teaching, which puts on the mask of orthodoxy and deceives the unwary. Wordsworth notes that, in the Apocalypse, the false teacher bears some emblems of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11</a>). All false doctrine retains some element of truth, and it is because of this admixture that it procures adherents and thrives for a time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">calling</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(liq&#183;r&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7121.htm">Strong's 7121: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call, proclaim, read</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to those who pass by,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1469;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1437;&#1502;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;ya&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Verb - Piel - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3474.htm">Strong's 3474: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be straight, even, to be, right, pleasant, prosperous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their paths {straight}:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_734.htm">Strong's 734: </a> </span><span class="str2">A well-trodden road, a caravan</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/9-15.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 9:15 To call to those who pass (Prov.
