In the biblical context, it reflects the principle of sowing and reaping, where persistent rejection of God's guidance leads to a point where He withholds His response. This is reminiscent of the warnings given to Israel in the Old Testament, where God repeatedly called His people to repentance, but they often turned away (<a href="/isaiah/65-12.htm">Isaiah 65:12</a>). The idea of God not answering is also seen in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25-11.htm">Matthew 25:11-12</a>), where the unprepared are shut out and their calls go unanswered. This serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of seeking God while He may be found (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>).<p><b>they will earnestly seek me, but will not find me.</b><br>This phrase underscores the urgency and necessity of seeking God while He is near. The earnest seeking mentioned here is too late, illustrating the tragic reality of missed opportunities. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, seeking God was often associated with seeking His presence in the temple or through the prophets. However, when the time of grace is ignored, the opportunity for repentance can be lost, as seen in the lament of Esau who sought the blessing with tears but found no place for repentance (<a href="/hebrews/12-17.htm">Hebrews 12:17</a>). This also connects to the prophetic call in <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11-12</a>, where a famine of hearing the words of the Lord is described, emphasizing the dire consequences of neglecting God's wisdom. Theologically, this points to the necessity of a genuine relationship with God through Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_callers.htm">The Callers</a></b><br>These are individuals who have ignored wisdom and instruction.

The change in this verse from the second to the third person is striking. It implies that Wisdom thinks fools no longer worthy of being addressed personally - "Quasi stultos indignos censunt ulteriori alloquio" (Gejerus and Michaelis). The declaration is the embodiment of the laughter and scorn of ver. 26. The three verbs, "they shall call," "they shall seek," "they shall find," occur in uncommon and emphatic forms in the original. They are some out of the few instances where the future terminations are inserted fully before the pronominal suffix. <span class="cmt_word">I will not answer</span>. The distress and anguish consequent upon their calamity and fear lead them to pray, but there will be no answer nor heed given to their cry. They are not heard, because they do not cry rightly nor in the time of grace (Lapide). See the striking parallel to the tenor of this passage in <a href="/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24-28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They shall seek me early;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> diligently. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shakhar</span>) is the denominative from the substantive <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shakar</span>), "the dawn, morning," and signifies to go out and seek something in the obscurity of the morning twilight (Delitzsch, Zockler), and hence indicates diligence and earnestness in the search. Gesenius gives the same derivation, but connects it with the dawn in the sense of the light breaking forth, and thus, as it were, seeking (see also Proverbs 2:27; 7:15; 8:17; <a href="/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/1-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they will call on me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1453;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1467;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(yiq&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;un&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; first person common singular, Paragogic nun<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7121.htm">Strong's 7121: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call, proclaim, read</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but I will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answer;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1469;&#1506;&#1457;&#1504;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;neh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6030.htm">Strong's 6030: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer, respond</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they {will} earnestly seek me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1437;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1467;&#1431;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;run&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; first person common singular, Paragogic nun<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7836.htm">Strong's 7836: </a> </span><span class="str2">To dawn, be, early at any task, to search for</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but {will} not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">find me.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;&#1467;&#1469;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#8217;un&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; first person common singular, Paragogic nun<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/1-28.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 1:28 Then will they call on me (Prov.
