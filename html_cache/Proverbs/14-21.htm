In biblical times, neighbors were not just those living in close proximity but included fellow members of the community and even foreigners residing among them. The Hebrew word for "despises" implies a deep-seated contempt or disdain, which is contrary to the spirit of unity and love that God desires among His people. This phrase underscores the moral and ethical responsibility to treat others with respect and dignity, reflecting the image of God in every person. The sin here is not just a social faux pas but a transgression against God's law, highlighting the seriousness of harboring ill will towards others.<p><b>but blessed is he who shows kindness to the poor</b><br>The concept of blessing in the Bible often denotes a state of happiness or divine favor. Showing kindness to the poor is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing God's concern for the marginalized and vulnerable. <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a> states, "Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will reward them for what they have done." This reflects the idea that acts of kindness are not only moral obligations but also opportunities to serve God directly. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the poor were often landless, without means of support, and reliant on the generosity of others. The call to show kindness is a call to action, encouraging believers to reflect God's compassion and justice. This phrase also points to the character of Jesus Christ, who exemplified perfect kindness and compassion, particularly towards the poor and needy, as seen in His ministry throughout the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, a neighbor refers to anyone in close proximity, not just geographically but also relationally.

Jesus confirms the principle: &#8220;Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<p>&#8226; Early believers remembered this priority even amid doctrinal debates (<a href="/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226;

Treating any neighbor with disdain is sin, because it defies God&#8217;s command to love. In contrast, God pronounces blessing on those who actively extend kindness to the poor. Choosing compassion aligns us with the Lord&#8217;s own heart, opens us to His favor, and turns everyday encounters into opportunities for eternal impact.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth.</span> Taken in connection with the preceding verse, this teaches that it is a sin to despise and shun a man because he is poor or of low estate; such a one has a claim for love and pity, and it is a crime to withhold them from him for selfish considerations. The Christian view is taught by the parable of the good Samaritan. <span class="cmt_word">But he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he;</span> hail to him! (<a href="/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>). Contempt is contrasted with mercy, sin with blessing. "Blessed are the merciful," said Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>): "for they shall obtain mercy;" and St. Paul preserves another precious word, "It is mere blessed to give than to receive" (<a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>). The merciful disposition, which shows itself in works of mercy, is a proof that the soul is in union with God, whose mercy is over all his works, whose mercy endureth forever, and therefore such a soul is blessed. "The poor," wrote James Howell, "are God's receivers, and the angels are his auditors" ('Five Hundred New Sayings'). The Vulgate here appends a line absent from the Hebrew and the ether versions, "He who believeth in the Lord loveth mercy." The true believer is charitable and bountiful, knowing that he will not hereby impoverish himself, but lay up a rich store of blessing; he acts thus not from mere philanthropy, but from higher motives: he has the grace of charity which springs from and rests upon his faith in God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/14-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He who despises</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;z-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_936.htm">Strong's 936: </a> </span><span class="str2">To disrespect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his neighbor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7453.htm">Strong's 7453: </a> </span><span class="str2">Friend, companion, fellow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sins,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;&#1461;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7789;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2398.htm">Strong's 2398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To miss, to sin, to forfeit, lack, expiate, repent, lead astray, condemn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but blessed is</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1493;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_835.htm">Strong's 835: </a> </span><span class="str2">Happiness, interjection, how happy!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he who shows kindness</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2603.htm">Strong's 2603: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bend, stoop in kindness to an inferior, to favor, bestow, to implore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the poor.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;w&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6041.htm">Strong's 6041: </a> </span><span class="str2">Poor, afflicted, humble</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/14-21.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 14:21 He who despises his neighbor sins (Prov.
