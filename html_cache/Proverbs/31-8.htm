In biblical times, leaders and those in positions of authority were expected to advocate for justice and righteousness. The act of opening one's mouth signifies taking a stand and using one's voice to influence and bring about change. This aligns with the biblical principle of being a voice for the voiceless, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, which calls for defending the oppressed.<p><b>for those with no voice</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the responsibility to advocate for those who cannot speak for themselves. In ancient Israel, the marginalized, such as widows, orphans, and foreigners, often lacked representation and protection. The call to speak for them reflects God's heart for justice and care for the vulnerable, as seen in <a href="/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3-4</a>, which urges defending the weak and fatherless. This advocacy is a reflection of God's character, who is described as a defender of the powerless.<p><b>for the cause of all the dispossessed</b><br>The term "dispossessed" refers to those who have been deprived of their rights, property, or status. In the historical context of the Old Testament, this could include those who lost their land due to debt or injustice. The call to speak for their cause is a call to restore justice and equity, resonating with the Year of Jubilee laws in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, which aimed to restore land and freedom to those who had lost them. This advocacy is a type of Christ, who in His ministry, consistently reached out to the marginalized and offered them hope and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_lemuel.htm">King Lemuel</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, King Lemuel is believed to have received these teachings from his mother. The identity of Lemuel is not clearly defined in the Bible, and some scholars suggest it may be a symbolic name.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dispossessed.htm">The Dispossessed</a></b><br>This term refers to individuals who are marginalized, oppressed, or deprived of their rights and possessions. In the context of ancient Israel, this could include widows, orphans, foreigners, and the poor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mother_of_king_lemuel.htm">The Mother of King Lemuel</a></b><br>She is the source of the wisdom imparted in <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>. Her teachings emphasize justice, righteousness, and the importance of speaking up for those who cannot speak for themselves.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_advocacy.htm">The Call to Advocacy</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to be the voice for those who cannot speak for themselves.

This includes the poor, the homeless, refugees, and others who are marginalized. Understanding their plight is the first step toward effective advocacy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/biblical_justice.htm">Biblical Justice</a></b><br>Biblical justice goes beyond legal justice; it involves restoring relationships and ensuring that everyone has access to what they need to live a dignified life. This aligns with God's heart for justice as seen throughout Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_steps_for_advocacy.htm">Practical Steps for Advocacy</a></b><br>Engage in practical actions such as volunteering, supporting organizations that work for justice, and using your voice in public forums to advocate for policies that protect the vulnerable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prayer.htm">The Role of Prayer</a></b><br>Prayer is a powerful tool in advocating for the dispossessed.
