However, its effects were well-known, and excessive consumption was warned against. The term "mocker" suggests that wine can lead to foolish behavior, causing one to act in ways that are shameful or embarrassing. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of wisdom versus folly, where wisdom is associated with self-control and folly with indulgence. The mockery here can be seen as the deceptive nature of wine, promising pleasure but often leading to disgrace. This is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>, which advises against drunkenness, highlighting the loss of control and the potential for sin.<p><b>strong drink is a brawler</b><br>Strong drink, likely referring to beverages with higher alcohol content than wine, is described as a "brawler," indicating its potential to incite violence and conflict. In ancient cultures, strong drink was often used in feasts and celebrations, but it also had the potential to lead to aggressive behavior and disputes. This phrase warns of the social and relational consequences of overindulgence. The imagery of a "brawler" suggests that strong drink can lead to physical altercations and a breakdown of community harmony. This is consistent with the biblical emphasis on peace and unity, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>, which encourages believers to pursue peace and mutual edification.<p><b>and whoever is led astray by them is not wise</b><br>The phrase "led astray" implies a departure from the path of wisdom and righteousness. In the biblical context, wisdom is highly valued, often equated with the fear of the Lord and adherence to His commandments. Being "led astray" by wine and strong drink suggests a surrender to temptation and a failure to exercise discernment and self-control. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that contrasts the wise, who follow God's ways, with the foolish, who are swayed by worldly desires. <a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-35</a> further elaborates on the dangers of alcohol, painting a vivid picture of its potential to lead one away from wisdom and into a life of regret and sorrow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
