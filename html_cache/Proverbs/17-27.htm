In biblical times, the ability to speak wisely and sparingly was highly regarded. Proverbs often contrasts the wise and the foolish, with the wise being those who know when to speak and when to remain silent. This restraint is seen as a sign of maturity and understanding. <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a> echoes this sentiment, advising believers to be "quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry." The restraint in speech is also a reflection of one's character and understanding of the power of words, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>, which states that "the tongue has the power of life and death."<p><b>and a man of understanding maintains a calm spirit</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the importance of maintaining composure and peace, even in challenging situations. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where honor and shame were significant social values, maintaining a calm spirit was a sign of strength and dignity. The ability to remain calm is often associated with trust in God and reliance on His wisdom, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>, which promises perfect peace to those whose minds are steadfast because they trust in God. This calmness is also a fruit of the Spirit, as described in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where self-control and peace are listed among the attributes of a life led by the Spirit. The ultimate example of maintaining a calm spirit is found in Jesus Christ, who, even when faced with persecution and crucifixion, remained composed and forgiving, as seen in <a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context of Proverbs is ancient Israel, where wisdom literature was highly valued.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_man.htm">Wise Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who embody the virtues of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding as described in Proverbs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_restraint.htm">The Value of Restraint</a></b><br>Restraining one's words is a sign of knowledge and wisdom.
