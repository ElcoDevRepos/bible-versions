The imagery of a lion's roar conveys power, fear, and impending danger. Lions were known as apex predators in the region, symbolizing strength and dominance. This phrase emphasizes the potential threat and destruction that can come from a ruler's wrath. Biblically, the lion is often used to depict strength and authority, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>, where the lion's roar signifies God's judgment. The king's anger can be seen as a type of divine judgment, reflecting the ultimate authority of God, the King of Kings.<p><b>but his favor is like dew on the grass</b><br>Dew in the biblical context symbolizes blessing, refreshment, and life-giving sustenance. In the arid climate of the Middle East, dew was crucial for agriculture, providing moisture necessary for crops to thrive. The king's favor, therefore, is portrayed as life-giving and beneficial, bringing prosperity and peace. This imagery is consistent with other scriptural references, such as <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>, where God promises to be like dew to Israel, signifying His blessing and care. The favor of a king, much like God's grace, can bring about renewal and flourishing. This phrase also points to the benevolent rule of Christ, the ultimate King, whose favor brings spiritual refreshment and growth to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king.htm">King</a></b><br>Represents authority and power.

In Scripture a king&#8217;s power is no mere formality; it can decide life or death (<a href="/proverbs/16-14.htm">Proverbs 16:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the verse is literal, it reminds us that earthly leaders carry God-ordained weight (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>). Ignoring that reality puts one in genuine danger, not simply symbolic trouble.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a> warns, &#8220;A king&#8217;s wrath strikes terror like the roar of a lion; whoever angers him forfeits his life&#8221;. God calls us to respect rulers, not because they are perfect, but because He uses them to maintain order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like the roar of a lion</b><p>&#8226; A lion&#8217;s roar is loud, unavoidable, and capable of stopping prey in its tracks. Likewise, the moment a ruler is provoked, everything changes.<p>&#8226; The imagery signals urgency. Just as you would seek immediate shelter from a roaring lion, you wisely avoid provoking authority (<a href="/1_kings/2-42.htm">1 Kings 2:42-46</a>; <a href="/esther/7-7.htm">Esther 7:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a> compares a wicked ruler to &#8220;a roaring lion and a charging bear,&#8221; reinforcing that unchecked power can destroy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But his favor</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;But&#8221; shifts from danger to blessing. The same king who can roar can also reward. That dual possibility motivates obedience (<a href="/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s story illustrates this pivot: Pharaoh&#8217;s approval moved Joseph from prison to palace overnight (<a href="/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-44</a>).<p>&#8226; Gaining favor isn&#8217;t manipulation; it is living righteously so that God moves a leader&#8217;s heart for our good (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like dew on the grass</b><p>&#8226; Dew is gentle, life-giving, and refreshing. It arrives quietly yet nourishes an entire field.<p>&#8226; Early Israel depended on nightly dew for crops (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>). Likewise, royal favor can open doors, provide resources, and grant peace (<a href="/nehemiah/2-4.htm">Nehemiah 2:4-8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a> foreshadows Christ&#8217;s reign: &#8220;May he be like rain that falls on mown grass, like showers that water the earth&#8221;. Earthly kings only echo the perfect benevolence of the King of kings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Living wisely under authority</b><p>&#8226; Avoid provoking authority:<p>&#8211; Speak respectfully (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-14</a>).<p>&#8211; Obey laws unless they demand disobedience to God (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Seek favor by walking in integrity:<p>&#8211; Diligent work distinguishes believers (<a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>).<p>&#8211; Prayer for leaders invites God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Trust God&#8217;s sovereignty: even unjust rulers are under His hand, as seen with Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a> sets two vivid contrasts: the king&#8217;s wrath&#8212;swift, frightening, unavoidable like a lion&#8217;s roar; and the king&#8217;s favor&#8212;gentle, nourishing, life-sustaining like dew. Scripture urges wise respect for God-appointed authority, warning against needless provocation and commending integrity that attracts blessing. Behind every earthly throne stands the sovereign Lord, whose ultimate reign perfectly balances justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion,</span> which inspires terror, as preluding danger and death. The same idea occurs in <a href="/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a> (comp. <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4, 8</a>). The Assyrian monuments have made us familiar with the lion as a type of royalty; and the famous throne of Solomon was ornamented with figures of lions on each of its six steps (<a href="/1_kings/10-19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>, etc.). Thus St. Paul. alluding to the Roman emperor, says (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>), "I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion." "The lion is dead," announced Marsyas to Agrippa, on the decease of Tiberius (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:06, 10). The mondist here gives a monition to kings to repress their wrath and not to let it rage uncontrolled, and a warning to subjects not to offend their ruler, lest he tear them to pieces like a savage beast, which an Eastern despot had full power to do. <span class="cmt_word">But his favour is as dew upon the grass</span>. In <a href="/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a> the king's favour was compared to a cloud of the latter rain; here it is likened to the dew (comp. <a href="/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>). We hardly understand in England the real bearing of this comparison. "The secret of the luxuriant fertility of many parts of Palestine," says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land and Bible,' 1:72, etc.), "lies in the rich supply of moisture afforded by the seawinds which blow inland each night, and water the face of the whole land. There is no dew, properly so called in Palestine, for there is no moisture in the hot summer air to be chilled into dewdrops by the coolness of the night, as in a climate like ours. From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard; and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse.... To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands The amount of moisture thus poured on the thirsty vegetation during the night is very great. Dew seemed to the Israelites a mysterious gift of Heaven, as indeed it is. That the skies should be stayed from yielding it was a special sign of Divine wrath, and there could be no more gracious conception of a loving farewell address to his people than where Moses tells them that his speech should distil as the dew. The favour of an Oriental monarch could not be more boneficially conceived than by saying that, while his wrath is like the roaring of a lion, his favour is as the dew upon the grass." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (ration), "favour," is translated by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">hilaritas</span>, "cheerfulness" (as in <a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>), which gives the notion of a smiling, serene, benevolent countenance as contrasted with the angry, lowering look of displeased monarch. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/19-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A king&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1425;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rage</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(za&#183;&#8216;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2197.htm">Strong's 2197: </a> </span><span class="str2">A storming, raging, rage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is like the roar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1443;&#1492;&#1463;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;ham)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5099.htm">Strong's 5099: </a> </span><span class="str2">Growling (of a lion)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of a lion,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1453;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(kak&#183;k&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124;
