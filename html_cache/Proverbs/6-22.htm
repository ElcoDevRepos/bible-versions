In biblical context, "walking" often symbolizes living according to God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>). The "they" refers to the teachings and commandments of wisdom, which are personified throughout Proverbs. The guidance offered is akin to the pillar of cloud and fire that led the Israelites through the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), symbolizing divine direction and protection. This guidance is not just for spiritual matters but encompasses all aspects of life, suggesting that God's wisdom is applicable in every situation.<p><b>when you lie down, they will watch over you;</b><br>The imagery of lying down conveys rest and vulnerability. In ancient Near Eastern culture, night was a time of potential danger, and the assurance of being watched over would have been comforting. This protection is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3-4</a>, where God is described as a vigilant guardian who neither slumbers nor sleeps. The wisdom of God acts as a safeguard, providing peace and security even in times of rest. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a shepherd who watches over His flock (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-4</a>).<p><b>when you awake, they will speak to you.</b><br>Awakening signifies a new beginning, a fresh start each day. The idea that wisdom "speaks" suggests an ongoing, dynamic relationship with God's teachings. This aligns with the concept of God's mercies being new every morning (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>). The speaking of wisdom can be seen as the Holy Spirit's role in guiding believers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). It also echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where God's words are to be upon the heart and discussed throughout the day, indicating that divine wisdom is meant to be a constant companion and counselor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation to whom the wisdom literature, including Proverbs, was originally addressed, providing guidance for living a life pleasing to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_path_of_wisdom.htm">The Path of Wisdom</a></b><br>- A metaphorical journey representing the life of a believer who follows God's commandments and wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_ever-present_guidance_of_wisdom.htm">The Ever-Present Guidance of Wisdom</a></b><br>God's wisdom is not limited to specific times or places; it is a constant guide in every aspect of life, whether we are active, resting, or beginning a new day.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_protective_nature_of_god's_commandments.htm">The Protective Nature of God's Commandments</a></b><br>Just as wisdom watches over us, God's commandments provide protection and security, keeping us from harm and leading us in righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice_of_wisdom_in_our_lives.htm">The Voice of Wisdom in Our Lives</a></b><br>Wisdom speaks to us through God's Word, offering counsel and direction.

The &#8220;they&#8221; refers to the commands and teaching in the previous verse (<a href="/proverbs/6-20.htm">Proverbs 6:20&#8211;21</a>), showing that God&#8217;s instructions are never meant to stay tucked away; they travel with us.<p>&#8226; Walking implies movement, decisions, and routines. Scripture is designed to steer those choices in real time&#8212;just as <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a> declares, &#8220;Your word is a lamp for my feet and a light on my path.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> echoes the promise: as we trust the Lord and acknowledge Him, &#8220;He will make your paths straight.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Even course-corrections come from the same voice (<a href="/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>), reminding us that guidance is continuous, not occasional.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When you lie down, they will watch over you</b><p>&#8226; Nighttime represents vulnerability and rest. God&#8217;s commands do not clock out when the lights go off. &#8220;When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you rest, your sleep will be sweet&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-24.htm">Proverbs 3:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;watch&#8221; underscores protection. Like a sentry at the gate, Scripture guards heart and mind from the fears that surface after dark&#8212;paralleled in <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>: &#8220;In peace I will lie down and sleep, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3-4</a> affirms that the One behind these commands &#8220;will neither slumber nor sleep,&#8221; so His promises remain active while we cannot.<p>&#8226; Practical outworking: ending the day with God&#8217;s Word positions His truth over anxieties, allowing true rest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When you awake, they will speak to you</b><p>&#8226; Dawn signals new mercies (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>). As soon as consciousness returns, God&#8217;s instructions are ready to &#8220;speak,&#8221; setting the tone for the day.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/50-4.htm">Isaiah 50:4</a> pictures the Lord awakening the listener &#8220;to listen like one being taught,&#8221; emphasizing that morning revelation is personal and fresh.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a> pleads, &#8220;Let me hear Your loving devotion in the morning,&#8221; showing that the habit of meeting God early invites direction before distractions surge.<p>&#8226; Practically, this means the same truths that guarded our sleep now become the first conversation of the day&#8212;nudging attitudes, priorities, and affections toward Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a> assures that God&#8217;s commands are not static words but a living companion. They guide every step, guard every night, and greet every sunrise. Keep them close, and you will never walk, rest, or awaken alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The going, sleeping, and awaking occur in the same order in the Pentateuch, from which the ideas of this and the preceding verse are evidently derived (see <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> and Deuteronomy 11:19). Though only specifying three conditions, they refer to the whole conduct of life, and hence the verse promises direction, guardianship, and converse of wisdom, which will undoubtedly attend life where the precepts of parents are lovingly treasured and obediently observed. The Authorized Version conveys the impression that it is "the keeping" of the parents' precepts, etc., which is to bear such results; but it is better to understand "it" as signifying the whole teaching or doctrine of wisdom, as Delitzsch. Wisdom becomes personified in the representation, and identified with her teaching. <span class="cmt_word">It shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">lead thee.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">nakhah</span>, "to lead," in the sense of "to direct," like the Latin <span class="accented">dirigere</span> (Delitzsch), and as it is used in Exodus and Numbers, <span class="accented">passim.</span> In the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a>, etc.) it is employed of God as governing men. Hence, in the affairs of life, Wisdom will so guide and control us that we shall act uprightly. There is the further notion imported into the word of preservation from evil (cf. <a href="/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a>, "Thou shalt walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble"). <span class="cmt_word">When thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">sleepest;</span> or, <span class="accented">when thou liest down</span>, as in <a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>, where the same verb occurs. <span class="cmt_word">It shall keep thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> watch over, keep safe, or preserve; as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">custodire</span>, and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. We have had the same verb, <span class="accented">shamar</span>, before in <a href="/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>. Wisdom will be as it were a guardian angel in our hours of repose. <span class="cmt_word">When thou awakest</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">hakitsotha</span>, the hiph. perfect of <span class="accented">kutz.</span> This word only occurs here. The hiph. form, <span class="accented">hekitz</span>, is intransitive, "to be aroused" (cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>It shall talk with thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">she.</span> Bertheau renders, "She will make thee thoughtful;" and Dathe, "Let them be thy meditation;" but the accusative suffix designates the person who is the object of the action of the verb, as in <a href="/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a> (Zockler) and as Delitzseh remarks, the personification requires something more than a mere meditation with one's self on the precepts of Wisdom. Wisdom herself shall hold converse with thee (cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), she shall suggest thoughts how thou art to behave thyself. The meaning of the verb, "to meditate," "to think deeply," however, need not be lost sight of. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When you walk,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1499;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1448;
