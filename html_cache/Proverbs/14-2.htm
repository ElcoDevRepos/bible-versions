In biblical context, "uprightness" refers to living in accordance with God's commandments and moral laws. The fear of the LORD is a recurring theme in Proverbs, signifying a deep respect and awe for God's authority and holiness. This fear is not about being afraid but about recognizing God's power and aligning one's life with His will. The concept of walking in uprightness is echoed in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a>, where the righteous are compared to a tree planted by streams of water, symbolizing stability and prosperity. Historically, the Israelites were called to be a holy nation, set apart by their adherence to God's laws, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>. This phrase also points to the life of Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodied uprightness and reverence for the Father, serving as the ultimate example for believers.<p><b>but the one who is devious in his ways despises Him</b><br>This part contrasts the upright with those who are "devious," indicating a life characterized by deceit and moral corruption. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, deviousness was often associated with idolatry and injustice, actions that were seen as direct affronts to God's character. The term "despises" suggests a willful rejection of God's authority and a lack of respect for His commandments. This attitude is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>, where the wicked, in their pride, do not seek God. The devious person is likened to the fool in Proverbs, who rejects wisdom and understanding. This phrase serves as a warning against the dangers of straying from God's path, highlighting the spiritual and moral consequences of such choices. The ultimate fulfillment of this warning is seen in the separation from God that results from persistent rebellion, as illustrated in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus in <a

1:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Uprightness speaks of moral integrity&#8212;doing what is right even when no one is watching (<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse ties upright living to genuine reverence for God; faithful behavior flows out of a heart that knows and honors Him (<a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, uprightness shows up in truthful speech, fair dealings, sexual purity, and care for others (<a

keeps us close to God&#8217;s Word, trusting His promises and heeding His warnings (<a href="/psalms/112-1.htm">Psalm 112:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>).<p>&#8226; It produces humility, gratitude, and a desire to please Him above all (<a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Fear of the LORD is foundational; without it morality quickly drifts

<a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture equates love for God with obedience (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).

Our daily choices reveal whom we truly revere.

And likewise, "he that despiseth Him is perverse in his ways." The fear of God and its absence are clearly seen in the outward conduct.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord.</span> So the Septuagint. He who lives an upright life does so because he fears the Lord; and his holy conversation is an evidence that he is influenced by religious motives. The outward conduct shows the inward feeling. So he that is <span class="cmt_word">perverse in his ways despiseth him</span> - the Lord. A man is evil in his actions because he has cast off the fear of God; and such wickedness is a proof that he has lost all reverence for God and care to please him. Delitzsch renders, "He walketh in his uprightness who feareth Jahve, and perverse in his ways is he that despiseth him;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the conduct of the two shows the way in which they severally regard God and religion, the former acting conscientiously and uprightly, the latter following his own lusts, which lead him astray. Either interpretation is admissible.

The Vulgate gives quite a different turn to the sentence, "He who walketh in the right way and feareth the Lord is despised by him who pursueth the path of shame."
