In the ancient Near Eastern context, generosity was not only a personal virtue but also a social expectation. The Hebrew word for "generous" implies a willingness to give freely and abundantly. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that those who give are often blessed in return, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>, "Give, and it will be given to you." The promise of blessing for the generous is a recurring theme, suggesting that God honors and rewards those who reflect His character through acts of kindness and charity.<p><b>for he shares his bread with the poor</b><br>Sharing bread in biblical times was a fundamental act of hospitality and community. Bread, a staple food, symbolizes sustenance and life. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, sharing bread with the poor was a tangible expression of compassion and obedience to God's commands to care for the needy, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>, "For there will never cease to be poor in the land. Therefore I command you, 'You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor, in your land.'" This act of sharing is not merely about providing physical nourishment but also about restoring dignity and hope to those in need. It reflects the heart of God, who is described as a provider and protector of the poor throughout Scripture. This phrase also foreshadows the ministry of Jesus Christ, who fed the hungry and taught His followers to do likewise, embodying the ultimate example of generosity and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_generous_man.htm">The Generous Man</a></b><br>This individual is characterized by a willingness to give and share resources, particularly with those in need.

The second portion of the Latin addition may mean that the liberal man wins and carries away with him the souls of the recipients of his bounty. But this, though Ewald would fain have it so, cannot be the signification of the corresponding Greek, which seems to mean that the man who is so liberal in distributing gifts obtains the power to do so by oppressing and wronging others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/22-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A generous [man]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be blessed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;r&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1288.htm">Strong's 1288: </a> </span><span class="str2">To kneel, to bless God, man, to curse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he shares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;la&#7717;&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with the poor.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(lad&#183;d&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Adjective - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1800.htm">Strong's 1800: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dangling, weak, thin</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/22-9.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 22:9 He who has a generous eye will (Prov.
