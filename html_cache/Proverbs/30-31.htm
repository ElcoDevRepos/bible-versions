In biblical times, roosters were common in the region and known for their confident demeanor. This imagery may remind readers of the need for vigilance in spiritual life, akin to the rooster's alertness at dawn. The rooster's crowing is also significant in the New Testament, notably in Peter's denial of Christ (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>), symbolizing awareness and the call to repentance.<p><b>a he-goat</b><br>The he-goat is a symbol of leadership and strength. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, goats were valued for their resourcefulness and ability to lead flocks. The he-goat's role as a leader among animals can be seen as a metaphor for strong and decisive leadership. In <a href="/daniel/8.htm">Daniel 8</a>, a goat represents the kingdom of Greece, led by Alexander the Great, highlighting the power and influence of a leader. The he-goat's imagery may also point to the need for spiritual leaders to guide with wisdom and strength.<p><b>and a king with his army around him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and command of a king, surrounded by his loyal subjects. In ancient Israel, a king's strength was often measured by the loyalty and readiness of his army. This imagery reflects the biblical ideal of a righteous king who leads with justice and is supported by his people. It can also be seen as a type of Christ, the King of Kings, who leads His spiritual army, the Church, with authority and righteousness. The unity and order of the king's army serve as a model for the Church's unity under Christ's leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/strutting_rooster.htm">Strutting Rooster</a></b><br>The rooster is often seen as a symbol of pride and confidence.

In post-biblical Hebrew <span class="accented">zarzir is</span> found as the name of some pugnacious bird, and the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac call it here the cock. So also Aquila and Theodotion. But if the word is onomatopoetic, it would seem to apply with more propriety to one of the raven tribe; and then what is to be made of the allusion to the loins? And how comes it that amid the quadrupeds in the gnome a bird should suddenly be introduced, as one stately in going? It seems certain that some quadruped is here meant, but what? What animal has as characteristic tight-girded loins or slender or active loins? There are, indeed, many that might be so designated, but none that, as far as we know, appropriated this unique appellation. Hence various opinions are held by commentators concerning the identification. The zebra, say some, with its stripes, which may be thus denoted; the war horse, say others, comparing <a href="/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19, 25</a>, and considering the trappings with which, as we see in ancient sculptures, he was adorned; others, again, fix upon the leopard as the beast intended. But that of the Authorized Version seems, on the whole, to be the most likely rendering, the slender, agile make of the greyhound having given cause for the appropriation of the term used in the text. Delitzsch compares the German word <span class="accented">windspiel</span>, which designates the greyhound without the necessity of using the full term, <span class="accented">wiadspielhund</span>. The only points which may be considered adverse to this view are these two, viz. the ill repute in which dogs were held by the Hebrews, Scripture consistently disparaging and despising them; and the fact that, as far as we have information, the Jews did not use dogs for hunting purposes, though nowadays the Arabs keep a kind of Persian greyhound for sporting, and Assyrian monuments have familiarized us with the appearance of hounds employed in the chase of the lion and the wild ox. Agur may be referring to what he has seen elsewhere, but what was well known to these for whom he wrote. Gesenius suggests (253), "a warrior girt in the loins," which is adopted by Wordsworth, and gives a suitable idea. This would correspond with the king in the last line; but the interpretation is quite arbitrary, and supported by no ancient authority, resting on the fact that girding the loins is always spoken of human beings. The cock strutting among his hens is, as we have hinted, the idea which approves itself to many ancient translators. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. We are not disposed to adept this identification, more especially as common poultry were unknown in Palestine till long after Solomon's time. Certainly what we call cocks and hens, or barn door fowls, are never mentioned in the Old Testament. and seem to have been introduced from Persia after the rise of the Persian empire. The latest editors decide for the war horse; but the conflicting claims cannot be reconciled, and the matter must be left undetermined. <span class="cmt_word">An he goat also.</span> This is a very natural comparison, as the stately manner in which the he goat (<span class="accented">tay-ish</span>, "the butter") heads the flock has been always observed. The LXX. expresses this, paraphrasing, "and the he goat leading the herd." "Flocks of goats are very numerous in Palestine at this day, as they were in former ages. We see them everywhere on the mountains, in smaller or larger numbers; at times also along with sheep, as one flock, in which ease it is usually a he goat that is the special leader of the whole, walking before it as gravely as a sexton before the white flock of a church choir" (Geikie, 'Holy Land,' 1:232). <span class="cmt_word">A king, against whom there is no rising up;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">nec est rex qui resistat ei</span>, which ought to mean "and a king whom nothing resists," but can scarcely be compelled to produce this meaning without violence. The difficulty in the sentence arises from the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, which in the above rendering is regarded as composed of the negative <span class="accented">al</span>, and <span class="accented">kum</span>, the infinitive, "to rise against, oppose." But this is contrary to grammatical usage, and would be a solecism. To some it has seemed that a proper name was intended, and they have invented a King Alkum or Alkimos, whom they suppose to have been celebrated in or after Solomon's time. Many modern commentators take the word to be an Arabic expression, consisting of <span class="accented">al</span>, the definite article, and <span class="accented">kum</span>, "people," and consider the meaning to be "a king with whom is the people," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. surrounded by his people or army. This is certainly a stately sight, and may well stand parallel to the hero lion among beasts, and the bold he goat at the head of the flock. Other Arabic expressions may probably be found elsewhere in this chapter; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, vers. 15, 16, 17, <span class="accented">aluka</span>, etc. Septuagint, "a king haranguing before a nation (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)." This passage, again, has been taken in a spiritual sense as referring to Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Warrior girt with the sword, the Leader of the flock, the King of kings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/30-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">a strutting rooster,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(zar&#183;z&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2223.htm">Strong's 2223: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tightly girt, a racer, some fleet animal</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a he-goat,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#257;&#183;yi&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8495.htm">Strong's 8495: </a> </span><span class="str2">A buck, he-goat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and a king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1502;&#1462;&#1431;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with his army</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al&#183;q&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_510.htm">Strong's 510: </a> </span><span class="str2">A band of soldiers</span><br /><br /><span class="word">around him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/30-31.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 30:31 The greyhound the male goat also (Prov.
