In biblical times, marriage was often arranged, and love was not always the primary factor. An "unloved woman" may refer to someone who is married out of obligation or duty rather than affection, similar to Leah's experience with Jacob (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>). The term "unloved" can also imply a lack of favor or acceptance, which could lead to discord within the household. The Bible often emphasizes the importance of love and respect in marriage (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>), and this proverb warns of the potential turmoil when these elements are absent.<p><b>and a maidservant who supplants her mistress</b><br>This part of the proverb reflects the social hierarchy and potential for conflict within a household. A maidservant gaining a higher status than her mistress disrupts the established order, similar to the story of Hagar and Sarah (Genesis 16). In ancient cultures, such a shift could lead to jealousy, strife, and division. The Bible frequently addresses the themes of humility and the dangers of pride (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), and this proverb serves as a caution against the upheaval that can occur when social roles are reversed. It also underscores the importance of maintaining harmony and respect within the family structure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/unloved_woman.htm">Unloved Woman</a></b><br>This refers to a woman who, despite being married, does not receive love or affection from her husband. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, marriage was often arranged, and love was not always a given. The Hebrew word used here can imply a woman who is despised or rejected.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/maidservant.htm">Maidservant</a></b><br>A female servant or slave in a household. In ancient times, maidservants had specific roles and were often considered lower in status than the mistress of the house.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mistress.htm">Mistress</a></b><br>The woman of the house, typically the wife of the master. She held authority over the household and the servants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/supplanting.htm">Supplanting</a></b><br>This term refers to taking the place of someone else, often through underhanded means. In this context, it suggests a reversal of roles where the maidservant takes the place of the mistress.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>A covenantal relationship that, in biblical times, was foundational to family and societal structure.

Leah&#8217;s experience illustrates this tension: &#8220;When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>). Leah&#8217;s yearning for Jacob&#8217;s affection colored every aspect of their home.<p>&#8226; The proverb warns that such unresolved hurt can shake a household&#8212;and even a community&#8212;because resentment often overflows. Compare <a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6&#8211;7</a>, where Peninnah&#8217;s taunts sprang from insecurity and poisoned family life.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;earth trembles&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/30-21.htm">Proverbs 30:21</a>) because God designed marriage to reflect His faithful love (<a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>). When love is absent, the marriage covenant is distorted, and stability gives way to strife.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A maidservant who supplants her mistress</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and a maidservant who supplants her mistress&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/30-23.htm">Proverbs 30:23</a>)<p>&#8226; A servant girl taking her mistress&#8217;s place overturns established order. Hagar&#8217;s story embodies the warning: &#8220;When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>). The ripple effects&#8212;envy, conflict, divided loyalties&#8212;reached every member of Abraham&#8217;s household (<a href="/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently stresses humility for those elevated to new roles. Joseph remained humble when raised from prison to power (<a href="/genesis/41-16.htm">Genesis 41:16, 51</a>&#8211;52). A servant who lacks that humility becomes proud, echoing the danger noted in <a href="/proverbs/28-25.htm">Proverbs 28:25</a>: &#8220;A greedy man stirs up strife.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The proverb also cautions leaders: careless promotion can destabilize a home, workplace, or nation, as seen when Solomon elevated Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28&#8211;40</a>), leading to rebellion.<p>&#8226; God honors proper authority structures (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>). When these are disregarded, turmoil follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/30-23.htm">Proverbs 30:23</a> highlights two upheavals that make &#8220;the earth tremble&#8221;: a marriage devoid of love and a servant displacing her mistress. Both scenarios expose hearts unprepared for new roles&#8212;hearts marked by hurt or pride. God&#8217;s design is stable, love-filled relationships ordered by humility and faithful authority. When His pattern is ignored, homes and societies shake; when embraced, they flourish.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">For an</span> <span class= "bld">odious woman when she is married.--</span>She pays off, with interest, the slights which she had formerly to endure from her married friends.<p><span class= "bld">An handmaid that is heir to her mistress, </span>and who is nervously anxious to preserve her newly-acquired dignity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For an odious woman when she is married;</span> or, <span class="accented">under an unloved woman when she is married</span>. The sentence does not refer to an unbeloved wife, a Leah, becoming the favourite, a Rachel; the expression, "when she is married," can hardly have this sense; but the gnome speaks of a woman who has passed much of her life without love, having nothing about her attractive either in looks, attainments, or manner, and is consequently soured and ill-tempered.
