In the ancient Near Eastern culture, loyalty and steadfastness were highly valued traits in relationships. The Hebrew word for "friend" here can also imply a close companion or confidant, suggesting a deep bond beyond mere acquaintance. This idea of unwavering love is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, where Jesus speaks of the greatest love being one that lays down its life for friends. The constancy of a true friend reflects the enduring love of God, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where His mercies are described as new every morning.<p><b>and a brother is born for adversity</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the role of family, particularly siblings, in times of trouble. In biblical times, family ties were crucial for survival and support, especially during hardships. The term "brother" here signifies not just a biological sibling but also someone who acts with the loyalty and support expected of family. This concept is seen in the story of Joseph and his brothers in Genesis, where despite initial betrayal, familial bonds ultimately lead to reconciliation and support during famine. The phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as our brother in <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11-12</a>, born to share in our sufferings and provide help in times of need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The verse suggests that relationships are tested and proven during such times.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_constancy_of_true_friendship.htm">The Constancy of True Friendship</a></b><br>True friendship is marked by unwavering love, regardless of circumstances. This constancy reflects God's love for us and serves as a model for our relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_in_adversity.htm">Purpose in Adversity</a></b><br>Adversity reveals the depth and strength of relationships.
