Silver mining required significant effort, patience, and skill, reflecting the diligence needed to acquire wisdom. In biblical times, silver was used as currency and a symbol of wealth and prosperity (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>). The comparison suggests that wisdom is not easily obtained but is worth the effort due to its immense value. This pursuit is echoed in <a href="/job/28.htm">Job 28:1-11</a>, where the search for wisdom is compared to mining for precious metals. The diligent search for wisdom is a recurring theme in Proverbs, emphasizing its importance and the effort required to attain it.<p><b>and search it out like hidden treasure</b><br>The imagery of hidden treasure suggests something of great worth that is not immediately visible or accessible. In the ancient Near East, treasures were often buried for safekeeping, requiring intentional and persistent searching to uncover. This metaphor highlights the idea that wisdom is not superficial but requires deep exploration and commitment. The concept of hidden treasure is also found in <a href="/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44</a>, where Jesus compares the kingdom of heaven to treasure hidden in a field, illustrating the supreme value of spiritual truths. The search for wisdom, like the search for hidden treasure, involves a heart fully committed to discovering and embracing God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was known for his wisdom, which he received from God.

(See the article "Mines," in Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible; </span>comp. also the description in <a href="/context/job/28-1.htm" title="Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.">Job 28:1-11</a>.)

It would often, no doubt, happen that the owner would die without disclosing the place of concealment to any one else, and the treasure thus be lost. Hunting after such hoards has in consequence been always of the keenest interest to Orientals, and as such furnishes the groundwork for one of our Lord's parables (<a href="/matthew/13-44.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to treasure hid in a field; the which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.">Matthew 13:44</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou seekest,</span> etc. The climax in the series of conditions is reached in this verse; and the imagery employed in both clauses indicates that the search after Wisdom is to be <span class="accented">persevering</span>, unrelaxing, and diligent, like the unremitting toil and labour with which men carry on mining operations. "To seek" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">bakash</span>) in the original is properly "to seek diligently" (piel), and is kindred to "to search" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>, <span class="accented">khaphas</span>), which again is equivalent to "to dig" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">khaphar</span>), the Vulgate <span class="accented">effodere</span>, "to dig out." Compare the expression in <a href="/job/3-21.htm">Job 3:21</a>, "And dig for it more than for hid treasures." We trace in these verbs the idea in the mind of the teacher indicated above, which finds expression also in the object of the search, the silver, in its crude state, and the hidden treasures (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">mat'monim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> the treasures of gold, silver, and precious metal concealed in the earth. The comparison here made between the search for Wisdom and the search for the hidden treasures of the earth was not unfamiliar to the Hebrew mind, as it is found worked out with great beauty of detail in the twenty-eighth chapter of Job. Again, the comparison of Wisdom with things most precious in the estimation of man is natural and common, and occurs in <a href="/psalms/119-72.htm">Psalm 119:72</a>; <a href="/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15-19</a>. The same ideas and comparisons here used are presented to us in the New Testament teaching, in our Lord's parable of the man who finds the hid treasure in the field, and, in the phraseology of St. Paul, who speaks of "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," and of "the unsearchable riches of Christ." "Divine knowledge is an inexhaustible mine of precious ore" (Wardlaw). The language of the Proverbs would receive additional three from the circumstances of the reign of Solomon, the most splendid and prosperous era in the annals of the Jewish national history, in the means taken to secure the treasures of other and distant countries; the wealth and the riches of that reign (see <a href="/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-22</a>) would help to bring out the idea of the superlative value of Wisdom. In no era of the Jewish national history was there such abundance of riches, such splendid prosperity, as in the reign of Solomon, whose ships of Tarshish brought "gold and silver" (see <a href="/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-22</a>), and this state of things would give point to the comparisons which the teacher uses in our text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you seek</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;&#353;en&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1245.htm">Strong's 1245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To search out, to strive after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it like silver</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;ak&#183;k&#257;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3701.htm">Strong's 3701: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silver, money</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and search it out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#7717;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#347;en&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2664.htm">Strong's 2664: </a> </span><span class="str2">To seek, to conceal oneself, mask</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like hidden treasure,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1499;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1496;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;am&#183;ma&#7789;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-k, Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4301.htm">Strong's 4301: </a> </span><span class="str2">A secret storehouse, a secreted valuable, money</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 2:4 If you seek her as silver (Prov.
