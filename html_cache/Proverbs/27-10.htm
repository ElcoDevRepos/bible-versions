In ancient Israel, friendships were often seen as covenantal, akin to familial bonds. The reference to a "father's friend" suggests a generational continuity, highlighting the value of longstanding relationships. This can be connected to the biblical principle of honoring one's parents, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>, by respecting and valuing their associations. The idea of covenant friendship is also seen in the relationship between David and Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/18.htm">1 Samuel 18:1-3</a>), where loyalty transcends personal gain.<p><b>and do not go to your brother&#8217;s house in the day of your calamity;</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a practical approach to seeking help. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, family ties were strong, but geographical distance could make immediate assistance difficult. The advice here is to seek help from those who are nearby and readily available. This reflects the wisdom of relying on those who can provide timely support, rather than those who may be obligated by blood but are not present. It also underscores the importance of community and the role of neighbors in providing support, as seen in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>).<p><b>better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.</b><br>This concluding phrase reinforces the practical wisdom of valuing proximity in relationships. In biblical times, travel was arduous and communication limited, making nearby relationships more immediately beneficial. This principle can be seen in the broader biblical theme of community and fellowship, as in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, where the early church is described as living in close community, sharing resources and supporting one another. Theologically, it can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as a friend who is always present (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>), emphasizing the value of a close and personal relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/friend.htm">Friend</a></b><br>A person with whom one shares a bond of mutual affection, typically one that is not familial.

It seems to be a combination of two maxims. <span class="cmt_word">Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.</span> A father's friend is one who is connected with a family by hereditary and ancestral bonds; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Septuagint. Such a one is to be cherished and regarded with the utmost affection. <span class="cmt_word">Neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity.</span> The tried friend is more likely to help and sympathize with you than even your own brother, for a friend is born for adversity, and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>, where see notes). The mere blood relationship, which is the result of circumstances over which one has had no control, is inferior to the affectionate connection which arises from moral considerations and is the effect of deliberate choice. We must remember, too, that the practice of polygamy, with the separate establishments of the various wives, greatly weakened the tie of brotherhood. There was little love between David's sons; and Jonathan was far dearer to David himself than any of his numerous brothers were. Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. "Near" and "far off" may be taken as referring to feeling or to local position. In the former case the maxim says that a neighbour who is really attached to one by the bonds of affection is better than the closest relation who has no love or sympathy. In the latter view, the proverb enunciates the truth that a friend on the spot in time of calamity is more useful than a brother living at a distance (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint); one is sure of help at once from the former, while application to the latter must occasion delay, and may not be successful.
