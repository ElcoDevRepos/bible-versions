In the context of Proverbs, wisdom is often personified and is seen as an attribute of God that was present at creation (<a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>). This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God's wisdom is beyond human comprehension (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>) and is evident in the natural world (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>).<p><b>the watery depths were broken open</b><br>This imagery recalls the creation account in Genesis, where God separated the waters to form the sky and the seas (<a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-7</a>). It also echoes the flood narrative, where the "fountains of the great deep" were broken up (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>), demonstrating God's control over the chaotic waters. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, water often symbolized chaos, and God's ability to control and order the waters signifies His sovereignty over creation. This phrase underscores God's power and authority in establishing the natural order.<p><b>and the clouds dripped with dew</b><br>In the ancient Near East, dew was a crucial source of moisture, especially in arid regions where rain was scarce. Dew is often seen as a blessing from God, providing sustenance and life (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>, <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>). This phrase highlights God's provision and care for His creation, ensuring that the earth is nourished. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the regularity of His provision, as seen in the cycles of nature (<a href="/job/38-28.htm">Job 38:28</a>). The imagery of dew can also symbolize spiritual refreshment and renewal, pointing to the sustaining presence of God in the lives of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The verse attributes the creation and maintenance of the natural world to God's wisdom and knowledge.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/watery_depths.htm">Watery Depths</a></b><br>This refers to the subterranean waters or the deep seas, symbolizing the chaotic elements of creation that God ordered.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/clouds.htm">Clouds</a></b><br>Representing the sky and the heavens, they are part of the natural order that God sustains.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dew.htm">Dew</a></b><br>A symbol of God's provision and blessing, often seen as a gentle and life-giving force in the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God, in His infinite wisdom, has established and maintains the natural order.

So Munster, Zockler, Wardlaw. But it seems better to understand it (as Mercerus, Lapide, Delitzsch, and Authorized Version) of the fertilization of the earth by rivers, streams, etc., which burst forth from the interior of the earth. In this sense the correspondence is preserved with the second hemistich. where the atmospheric influence is referred to as conducing to the same end. The teacher passes from the creation to the wonderful means which Jehovah employs through Wisdom to sustain his work. <span class="accented">The depths</span> (<span class="accented">t'homoth</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">abyssi</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, are here "the internal water stores of the earth" (Delitzsch), and not the depths of the ocean, as in <a href="/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24, 27, 28</a>, and in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. <span class="accented">Are broken up</span> (<span class="accented">niv'kau</span>); properly, <span class="accented">were broken up</span>, niph. perfect of <span class="accented">baka</span>, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to cleave asunder, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to break forth, as water, in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>. <p>The perfect describes a past act, but one that is still continuing in effect. Cf. Vulgate <span class="accented">eruperunt</span>, "they burst forth;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, aorist 2 passive of <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, "to burst forth," Targum, <span class="accented">rupti sunt</span>; and Syriac, <span class="accented">ruptae sunt.</span> The idea of division or separation is present, but it is not the predominant idea. There seems to be no allusion here either to the Deluge (Beds), nor to the cleaving of the waters of the Red Sea (Gejerus), though both of these historical events were undoubtedly well known to the teacher. And the clouds drop down the dew. <span class="accented">The clouds</span> (<span class="accented">sh'khakim</span>) are properly the <span class="accented">ether</span>, the higher and colder regions of the atmosphere, and then "the clouds," as in <a href="/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>, which are formed by the condensation of vapours drawn by solar influence from the surface of the earth - seas, rivers, etc. The singular <span class="accented">shakhak</span> signifies "dust," and. secondly "a cloud," evidently from the minute particles of moisture of which a cloud is composed. <span class="accented">Drop down</span> (<span class="accented">yir'aphu</span>, kal future of <span class="accented">raaph</span>, used as a present or imperfect); LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "let flow." The clouds discharge their contents in showers, or distil at evening in refreshing dew. Modern science agrees with the meteorological fact here alluded to, of the reciprocal action of the heavens and the earth. The moisture drawn from the earth returns again "to water the earth, that it may bring forth and bud, to give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater" (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>). <span class="accented">Dew</span>; <span class="accented">tal</span>, here used not only of dew, but of rain in gentle and fructifying showers. The Arabic word signifies "light rain;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "dew." Moses, in describing the blessing of Israel, says, "His heavens shall drop down dew" in the same sense (Deuteronomy 38:28; cf. <a href="/job/36-28.htm">Job 36:28</a>). The fertilization of the earth is ordered by the Divine Wisdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/3-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">By His knowledge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1847.htm">Strong's 1847: </a> </span><span class="str2">Knowledge</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the watery depths</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8415.htm">Strong's 8415: </a> </span><span class="str2">An abyss, the deep</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were broken open,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7687;&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1234.htm">Strong's 1234: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cleave, to rend, break, rip, open</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the clouds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7834.htm">Strong's 7834: </a> </span><span class="str2">A powder, a thin vapor, the firmament</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dripped</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1458;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;p&#772;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7491.htm">Strong's 7491: </a> </span><span class="str2">To trickle, drip</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with dew.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2919.htm">Strong's 2919: </a> </span><span class="str2">Night mist, dew</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/3-20.htm">Proverbs 3:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/3-20.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 3:20 By his knowledge the depths were broken (Prov.
