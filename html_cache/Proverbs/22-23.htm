In the ancient Near Eastern context, legal systems often favored the wealthy and powerful, leaving the poor and marginalized without recourse. The Bible consistently portrays God as a defender of the downtrodden, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>, which describes God as a "father to the fatherless" and a "defender of widows." This advocacy is not just a promise of future justice but an assurance of God's active involvement in the present. The phrase also reflects the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where He promises to uphold justice and righteousness. This is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the prophetic books, where God is depicted as taking up the cause of the oppressed against corrupt leaders and systems.<p><b>and will plunder those who rob them</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the principle of divine retribution. In biblical history, God often intervened to bring justice to those who were wronged, as seen in the stories of the Exodus, where God delivered the Israelites from Egyptian oppression. The term "plunder" suggests a reversal of fortunes, where those who exploit others will themselves be stripped of their ill-gotten gains. This is consistent with the biblical theme of sowing and reaping, as articulated in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows." The imagery of plundering also connects to the prophetic literature, where God is described as executing judgment on nations and individuals who act unjustly. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who in His earthly ministry, consistently stood against injustice and ultimately, through His death and resurrection, defeated the powers of sin and death, bringing about a new order of justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God as the ultimate judge and defender of the oppressed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>Implicit in the verse, these are the individuals who are wronged or robbed, whom the LORD promises to defend.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_robbers.htm">The Robbers</a></b><br>Those who commit acts of injustice or theft against the oppressed, whom the LORD will hold accountable.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_the_ultimate_defender.htm">God as the Ultimate Defender</a></b><br>Trust in God's justice, knowing He will defend those who are wronged.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_righteousness.htm">Call to Righteousness</a></b><br>Believers are called to emulate God's justice by standing up for the oppressed and acting righteously.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/warning_against_injustice.htm">Warning Against Injustice</a></b><br>A reminder that those who commit injustice will face divine retribution.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_divine_justice.htm">Faith in Divine Justice</a></b><br>Encourages patience and faith, trusting that God will address wrongs in His timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_participation_in_justice.htm">Active Participation in Justice</a></b><br>While God is the ultimate judge, believers are encouraged to actively participate in promoting justice and righteousness in their communities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_22_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 22:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_22_23_Trust_God_s_justice.htm">How does Proverbs 22:23 encourage us to trust God's justice in our lives?
