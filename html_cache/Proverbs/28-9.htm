In the context of ancient Israel, "the law" refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain God's instructions for His people. Turning away from the law implies a deliberate choice to ignore or reject God's guidance. This is reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience to God's law. The act of turning away suggests a hardened heart, similar to the Israelites' rebellion in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>). In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a rejection of God's authority, which is echoed in the New Testament when Jesus speaks of those who hear His words but do not act on them (<a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26-27</a>).<p><b>even his prayer is detestable</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the seriousness of disregarding God's law. In biblical times, prayer was a central aspect of worship and communication with God. However, the effectiveness of prayer is contingent upon the righteousness of the individual (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>). When one turns away from God's commandments, their prayers become unacceptable, akin to the sacrifices of the wicked, which are an abomination to the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8</a>). This reflects the principle that God desires obedience over ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). The term "detestable" underscores the severity of the offense, indicating that God does not merely ignore such prayers but finds them repugnant. This concept is further illustrated in <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>, where God refuses to listen to the prayers of those who persist in sin. The verse serves as a warning that a relationship with God requires both faith and obedience, a theme that is consistent throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

"God heareth not sinners" (<a href="/john/9-31.htm">John 9:31</a>). Such a man's prayer, if he does pray, is not hearty and sincere, and therefore, lacks the element which alone can make it acceptable. He will not resolve to forsake his favourite sin, even while paying outward worship to the God whoso Law he breaks: what wonder that the prophet so sternly denounces such offenders (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>. etc.), and the psalmist cries with terrible rigour, "When he shall be judged, let him be condemned; and let his prayer become sin" (<a href="/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7</a>)? St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 10:27), "Our heart blames us in offering up our prayers, when it calls to mind that it is set in opposition to the precepts of him whom it implores, and the prayer becomes abomination, when there is a 'turning away' from the control of the Law; in that wrily it is meet that a man should be a stranger to the favours of him to whose bidding he will not be subject." And again (ibid., 18:9, 10), "If that which he bids we do, that which we ask we shall obtain. For with God both these two do of necessity match with one another exactly, that practice should be sustained by prayer, and prayer by practice" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/28-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whoever turns</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1505;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;s&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5493.htm">Strong's 5493: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn aside</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his ear {away}</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1453;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;z&#601;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_241.htm">Strong's 241: </a> </span><span class="str2">Broadness, the ear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from hearing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#333;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the law,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8451.htm">Strong's 8451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Direction, instruction, law</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(gam-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his prayer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1437;&#1508;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;p&#772;il&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8605.htm">Strong's 8605: </a> </span><span class="str2">Intercession, supplication, a hymn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is detestable.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8441.htm">Strong's 8441: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something disgusting, an abhorrence, idolatry, an idol</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/28-9.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 28:9 He who turns away his ear (Prov.
