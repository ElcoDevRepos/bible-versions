The Mosaic Law explicitly prohibited Israelites from charging interest to their fellow countrymen (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>). This prohibition was rooted in the idea of community and mutual support among God's people. The practice of usury was seen as exploiting the vulnerable, particularly the poor, who might be forced to borrow out of necessity. In the broader biblical context, this phrase warns against the accumulation of wealth through unjust means, reflecting a broader biblical theme that God values justice and righteousness over material gain (<a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>, <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>lays it up for one who is kind to the poor</b><br>This phrase suggests a divine reversal where wealth gained through unjust means will ultimately benefit those who are righteous and compassionate. The Bible frequently emphasizes God's concern for the poor and His desire for His people to care for them (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>). The idea that wealth will be transferred to the righteous aligns with the biblical principle that God blesses those who are generous and kind-hearted (<a href="/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-9</a>). This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, though rich, became poor for our sake, so that through His poverty, we might become rich (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of this principle is seen in the Kingdom of God, where the last will be first, and the meek will inherit the earth (<a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, <a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wealth_accumulator.htm">The Wealth Accumulator</a></b><br>This person is characterized by gaining wealth through interest and usury, which implies exploiting others financially.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kind_benefactor.htm">The Kind Benefactor</a></b><br>This individual is the eventual recipient of the wealth accumulated by the first person.

Compare <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a> where the rich man&#8217;s plans revolve solely around himself, ending in loss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by interest and usury</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Interest and usury&#8221; point to taking advantage of another&#8217;s need.
