In biblical context, impulsivity is often contrasted with the wisdom and discernment that Proverbs advocates. The Hebrew culture valued wisdom as a guiding principle for life, and impulsive actions were seen as foolish and dangerous. This impulsivity can be compared to Esau's decision to sell his birthright for a meal (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>), demonstrating a lack of foresight and self-control.<p><b>like an ox going to the slaughter</b><br>The imagery of an ox going to the slaughter is vivid and conveys a sense of inevitable doom. In ancient Israel, oxen were valuable for their strength and utility in agriculture, yet they were also used in sacrifices. This duality underscores the tragic waste of potential when one follows a path of folly. The sacrificial system in the Old Testament, particularly in Leviticus, often involved the slaughter of oxen, making this imagery resonate with the audience's understanding of sacrifice and loss.<p><b>like a deer bounding into a trap</b><br>The comparison to a deer suggests a sudden and unexpected entrapment. In the ancient Near East, hunting was a common practice, and traps were used to catch animals unaware. This imagery emphasizes the deceptive nature of sin and temptation, which often appear harmless or enticing but lead to destruction. The deer, known for its swiftness and grace, is caught off guard, illustrating how even those who seem agile and alert can fall prey to temptation. This can be connected to the warning in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, which advises believers to be sober-minded and watchful, as the devil prowls like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_man.htm">The Young Man</a></b><br>Represents a person lacking wisdom and discernment, easily led astray by temptation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seductress.htm">The Seductress</a></b><br>Symbolizes temptation and sin, often personified as a woman leading the young man away from righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ox.htm">The Ox</a></b><br>An animal used metaphorically to describe the young man's lack of awareness and impending doom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deer.htm">The Deer</a></b><br>Another metaphorical animal, illustrating the suddenness and inevitability of the young man's entrapment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trap.htm">The Trap</a></b><br>Represents the consequences of sin and the entanglement that follows yielding to temptation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_impulse.htm">The Danger of Impulse</a></b><br>Acting on impulse without seeking God's wisdom can lead to destructive consequences.

Septuagint, "He followed, being cajoled (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>), ensnared like a silly bird" (see the article on <span class="accented">Cepphus Larus</span>, in Erasmus's 'Adag ,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> "Garrulitas"). As an ox goeth to the slaughter. He no more realizes the serious issue of his action than an irrational beast which, without prevision of the future, walks contentedly to the slaughter house, and is stupidly placid in the face of death. Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks. There is some difficulty in the translation of this clause. The Authorized Version, with which Delitzsch virtually agrees, is obtained by transposition of the nouns, the natural rendering of the Hebrew being "as fetters to the correction of a fool." The sense thus obtained is obvious: the youth follows the woman, as a fool or a criminal is led unresisting to confinement and degradation. Doubtless there is some error in the text, as may be seen by comparison of the versions. Septuagint (with which the Syriac agrees), "As a dog to chains, or as a hart struck to the liver with an arrow;" Vulgate, "As a frisking lamb, and not knowing that as a fool he is being dragged to bondage." The commentators are much divided. Fleischer, "As if in fetters to the punishment of the fool," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of himself; Ewald, "As when a steel trap (springs up) for the correction of a fool," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when a hidden trap suddenly catches an incautious person wandering where he has no business. The direct interpretation, that the youth follows the harlot, as fetters the proper punishment of fools, is unsatisfactory, because the parallelism leads us to expect a living being instead of "fetters." We are constrained to fall back on the Authorized Version as exhibiting the best mode of reconstructing a corrupt text. The youth, with his insensate passion, is compared to the madman or idiot who is taken away, unconscious of his fate, to a shameful deprivation of liberty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/7-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He follows her</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on impulse,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1451;&#1514;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(pi&#7791;&#183;&#8217;&#333;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6597.htm">Strong's 6597: </a> </span><span class="str2">Suddenness, suddenly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like an ox</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
