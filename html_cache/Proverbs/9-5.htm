In the context of Proverbs, wisdom is personified and actively seeks out those who are willing to learn. This echoes the call of Jesus in the New Testament, where He invites all who are weary to come to Him for rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). The proactive nature of the invitation highlights the accessibility of wisdom to those who are willing to accept it.<p><b>Eat my bread</b><br>Bread is a staple of life and often symbolizes sustenance and provision in the Bible. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing bread was a sign of fellowship and covenant. This phrase suggests that wisdom offers nourishment and sustenance for the soul, much like Jesus, who is referred to as the "Bread of Life" in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>. The act of eating implies internalizing and making wisdom a part of one's life.<p><b>And drink the wine I have mixed</b><br>Wine in biblical times was often mixed with spices or water to enhance its flavor and reduce its potency. This phrase suggests a prepared and intentional offering, indicating that wisdom is not only nourishing but also delightful and enriching. Wine is also a symbol of joy and celebration, as seen in the wedding at Cana (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>), where Jesus performed His first miracle. The mixing of wine can also be seen as a type of the New Covenant, where Jesus offers His blood as the wine of the new promise (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>Personified as a woman in <a href="/bsb/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9</a>, Wisdom invites people to partake in her feast, symbolizing the acceptance of divine instruction and understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/folly.htm">Folly</a></b><br>Also personified as a woman in the same chapter, Folly offers a contrasting invitation, leading to ignorance and destruction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_simple.htm">The Simple</a></b><br>Those who lack judgment and understanding, whom Wisdom seeks to instruct and guide.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_wisdom.htm">The House of Wisdom</a></b><br>A metaphorical place where Wisdom's feast is prepared, representing a life built on understanding and knowledge.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast.htm">The Feast</a></b><br>Symbolizes the spiritual nourishment and fulfillment found in embracing wisdom and God's teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/invitation_to_wisdom.htm">Invitation to Wisdom</a></b><br>God's wisdom is available to all who are willing to accept it.

Scripture repeatedly pictures the Lord taking the initiative:<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, &#8220;Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;the same gracious summons.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, &#8220;Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>, &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say, &#8216;Come!&#8217;&#8221;<p>When Wisdom says &#8220;Come,&#8221; she is offering access. We are not left to find the way on our own; we are beckoned, welcomed, and expected.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>eat my bread</b><p>Bread in Scripture signals sustenance and daily necessity. Here Wisdom provides what will actually satisfy the soul. Think of:<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>, where God rained &#8220;bread from heaven&#8221; to sustain Israel.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, Jesus&#8217; claim, &#8220;I am the bread of life; whoever comes to Me will never hunger.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>, &#8220;Taste and see that the LORD is good.&#8221;<p>By telling us to eat, Wisdom urges personal appropriation. Truth must be internalized&#8212;taken in, digested, and allowed to strengthen. This is more than learning facts; it is feeding on what God gives so that our inner life is nourished.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and drink the wine</b><p>Wine in Scripture often points to joy, fellowship, and covenant celebration. Wisdom offers not only survival but gladness. Note:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, God gives &#8220;wine that gladdens the heart of man.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-11</a>, Jesus turns water into wine, signaling messianic abundance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>, &#8220;Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ?&#8221;<p>The table Wisdom spreads is festive, not austere. Following God is meant to fill us with righteous delight, not grim duty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have mixed</b><p>The preparation is already complete; nothing is left for us to supply. In ancient banquets, the host blended wine with spices or water to enhance flavor and ensure abundance (cf. <a href="/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2</a>). Here:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, &#8220;You prepare a table before me&#8230; my cup overflows.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/14-17.htm">Luke 14:17</a>, &#8220;Come, for everything is now ready.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>, &#8220;By one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.&#8221;<p>Wisdom&#8217;s provision is thoughtful, lavish, and finished. Our role is reception, not contribution. The mixing also hints at deliberate care&#8212;God&#8217;s wisdom is perfectly suited to our need.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a> pictures Wisdom&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ&#8212;throwing open her doors and spreading a richly prepared table.
