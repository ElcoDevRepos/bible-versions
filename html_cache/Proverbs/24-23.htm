The "sayings of the wise" suggest teachings that are not only practical but divinely inspired, aligning with the wisdom tradition in Israel. This tradition is rooted in the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The phrase implies a collection of teachings that may have been gathered from various wise individuals, possibly including those outside of Israel, reflecting a broader understanding of wisdom that transcends cultural boundaries.<p><b>To show partiality in judgment:</b><br>Partiality in judgment refers to the unfair treatment of individuals based on personal bias or favoritism. In the ancient Near Eastern context, justice was a central concern, and judges were expected to uphold fairness and integrity. The Mosaic Law explicitly forbids partiality, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, emphasizing that justice should be blind to status or wealth. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where <a href="/james/2.htm">James 2:1-9</a> warns against favoritism within the Christian community. The call for impartiality reflects God's own nature, as He is described as a just judge who shows no favoritism (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p><b>is not good:</b><br>The phrase "is not good" is a moral evaluation, indicating that showing partiality is contrary to God's standards of righteousness. In the Hebrew context, "good" often refers to what aligns with God's will and purposes. The negative construction here underscores the seriousness of the offense, suggesting that partiality undermines the very fabric of justice and community. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that calls for justice and righteousness as foundational to a godly society (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The phrase serves as a warning that such behavior is not only socially destructive but also spiritually detrimental, as it contradicts the character of God and His desire for equitable treatment of all people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise.htm">The Wise</a></b><br>This refers to the sages or wise men who contributed to the collection of Proverbs.
