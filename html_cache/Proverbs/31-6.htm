In ancient times, strong drink, often a fermented beverage, was used for medicinal purposes or to ease pain. The idea of giving strong drink to someone who is perishing aligns with the cultural practices of using alcohol as a form of palliative care. This can be seen in other parts of Scripture, such as when wine was offered to Jesus on the cross (<a href="/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23</a>) to ease His suffering, though He refused it. Theologically, this phrase can be seen as an acknowledgment of human compassion and mercy, providing temporary relief to those in dire situations.<p><b>and wine to the bitter in soul</b><br>Wine, in biblical times, was a common beverage and often symbolized joy and celebration. However, in this context, it is given to those who are "bitter in soul," indicating deep emotional distress or sorrow. This phrase suggests that wine can serve as a temporary solace for those experiencing profound grief or hardship. The cultural context of the time recognized wine as a means to lift spirits and provide a momentary escape from the burdens of life. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that acknowledges human suffering and the need for comfort, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, which speaks of wine gladdening the heart. Theologically, it reflects the understanding that while earthly comforts are temporary, they can be a means of grace in times of need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_perishing.htm">The Perishing</a></b><br>This refers to individuals who are in a state of physical decline or facing imminent death.
