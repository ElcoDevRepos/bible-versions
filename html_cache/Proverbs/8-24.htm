In the biblical context, "watery depths" often symbolize chaos and the unknown, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters. The absence of these depths signifies a primordial state of creation, emphasizing the pre-existence of wisdom before the physical world was formed. This aligns with the idea that wisdom is eternal and foundational, as seen in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where the Word (Logos) is present at the beginning of creation.<p><b>I was brought forth</b><br>The phrase "I was brought forth" suggests the personification of wisdom as being birthed or generated. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>. The concept of being "brought forth" indicates an active role in creation, similar to how Christ is described as the agent through whom all things were made (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>). This highlights the integral role of divine wisdom in the order and design of the universe.<p><b>When no springs were overflowing with water</b><br>Springs overflowing with water symbolize life, sustenance, and abundance. In the ancient Near Eastern context, water was a precious resource, essential for survival and prosperity. The absence of springs indicates a time before the earth was filled with life-giving resources. This imagery connects to the biblical theme of God as the provider of living water, as seen in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where Jesus offers the water that leads to eternal life. The mention of springs also alludes to the future provision and sustenance that wisdom, and ultimately Christ, brings to creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>Personified in <a href="/bsb/proverbs/8.htm">Proverbs 8</a>, Wisdom is depicted as a divine attribute present with God before creation.
