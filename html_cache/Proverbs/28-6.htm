In biblical times, poverty was often seen as a sign of God's disfavor, yet this proverb challenges that notion by highlighting the moral superiority of the poor who maintain their integrity. Integrity, or moral uprightness, is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in figures like Job, who maintained his righteousness despite severe trials (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). The Hebrew word for "integrity" implies completeness and soundness, suggesting a life lived in accordance with God's laws. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in the Beatitudes, where He blesses the poor in spirit (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>), indicating that spiritual wealth is more valuable than material riches.<p><b>than a rich man whose ways are perverse</b><br>The contrast here is between wealth and moral corruption. The term "perverse" suggests a deviation from what is right or good, often associated with moral and ethical corruption. In the ancient Near East, wealth was frequently linked to power and influence, but this proverb warns against the moral pitfalls that can accompany riches. The Bible consistently warns of the dangers of wealth leading to moral compromise, as seen in the story of the rich young ruler who could not part with his possessions to follow Jesus (<a href="/mark/10-17.htm">Mark 10:17-22</a>). This phrase underscores the biblical principle that true wealth is found in righteousness and a right relationship with God, rather than in material abundance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/poor_man.htm">Poor Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who may lack material wealth but possess moral and ethical integrity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rich_man.htm">Rich Man</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who have material wealth but engage in morally corrupt or perverse behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, known for his wisdom and understanding of human nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which Proverbs was written, where wealth and integrity were significant societal themes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_literature.htm">Wisdom Literature</a></b><br>Proverbs is part of the wisdom literature in the Bible, focusing on practical and moral teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_integrity.htm">Value of Integrity</a></b><br>Integrity is a priceless virtue that surpasses material wealth.

Delitzsch calls him "a double-going deceiver." So Siracides imprecates, "Woe to the sinner that goeth two ways" (Ecclus. 2:12). "A double-minded man," says St James (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>), "is unstable in all his ways." It is not the endeavouring to serve God and mammon at the same time that is meant, but putting on the appearance of religion to mask wicked designs - in the present case in order to gain wealth.
