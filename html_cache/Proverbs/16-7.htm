In the Old Testament, pleasing the Lord often involved obedience to the Law, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>, where Israel is called to fear the Lord, walk in His ways, and love Him. The concept of pleasing God is also echoed in the New Testament, where faith is highlighted as essential (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). The idea is that a life pleasing to God is marked by righteousness, integrity, and devotion, reflecting the character of God Himself.<p><b>He makes even the man&#8217;s enemies</b><br>This part of the verse suggests divine intervention in human relationships. In biblical history, God often intervened on behalf of His people, as seen in the stories of Joseph, who found favor in the eyes of his captors (<a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>), and Daniel, who was protected in the lion's den (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>). The phrase implies that God has the power to influence the hearts and actions of others, even those who oppose His people.<p><b>live at peace with him</b><br>Peace in the biblical sense is more than the absence of conflict; it is a state of wholeness and harmony. The Hebrew word for peace, "shalom," encompasses well-being, prosperity, and tranquility. This peace is a gift from God, as seen in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where the Aaronic blessing calls for the Lord to give peace. The ultimate fulfillment of peace is found in Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), who reconciles humanity to God and to one another. This phrase suggests that when a person's life aligns with God's will, it can lead to harmonious relationships, even with former adversaries, reflecting the transformative power of God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God, who is pleased by the righteous ways of a person.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_man.htm">A Man</a></b><br>Represents any individual who seeks to live a life that pleases God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Those who oppose or are hostile to the individual, yet are influenced by God's intervention to be at peace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/pleasing_god_as_a_priority.htm">Pleasing God as a Priority</a></b><br>Our primary focus should be on living in a way that pleases the Lord.

Experience proves that nothing succeeds like success. Where a man is prosperous and things go well with him, even ill-wishers are content to east away or to dissemble their dislike, and to live at peace with him. Thus Abimelech King of Gerar fawned upon Isaac because he saw that the Lord was with him (<a href="/genesis/26-27.htm">Genesis 26:27</a>, etc.). This is the worldly side of the maxim. It has a higher aspect, and intimates the far reaching influence of goodness - how it disarms opposition, arouses reverence and love, gives no occasion for disputes, and spreads around an atmosphere of peace. To the Jews the maxim was taught by external circumstances. While they were doing the will of the Lord, their land was to be preserved from hostile attack (<a href="/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10</a>).
