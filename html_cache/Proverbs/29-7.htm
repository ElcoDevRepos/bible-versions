In the Old Testament, righteousness is closely linked to justice and mercy, reflecting God's character. The Hebrew word for "consider" implies a deep understanding and empathy, suggesting that the righteous actively seek to understand and address the needs of the poor. This aligns with the broader biblical mandate to care for the marginalized, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, which calls for defending the oppressed. The "poor" in ancient Israel were often those without land or social standing, making them vulnerable to exploitation. The righteous are called to advocate for them, reflecting God's heart for justice and mercy.<p><b>but the wicked have no regard for such concerns</b><br>"Wicked" in the biblical sense refers to those who live in opposition to God's ways, often characterized by selfishness and injustice. The phrase "have no regard" indicates a willful ignorance or indifference to the plight of the poor. This attitude is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>, which highlights neglect of the poor as a sin. The contrast between the righteous and the wicked here underscores a recurring biblical theme: true righteousness is demonstrated through actions, particularly in how one treats the vulnerable. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes caring for "the least of these" as a reflection of one's relationship with Him (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, the righteous are those who live according to God's laws and principles.
