In biblical context, rebuke is often seen as a necessary part of maintaining righteousness and community standards. Proverbs frequently emphasizes the value of wisdom and correction (<a href="/proverbs/9-8.htm">Proverbs 9:8, 27</a>:5). The act of rebuking is not merely criticism but is intended to guide someone back to the right path. In the New Testament, Jesus rebukes His disciples and others to teach and correct (<a href="/mark/8-33.htm">Mark 8:33</a>).<p><b>will later find more favor</b><br>The idea of finding favor suggests a positive outcome or approval from others, including God. This aligns with the biblical principle that truth and righteousness ultimately lead to blessing and honor (<a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3-4</a>). The "later" aspect indicates that the benefits of rebuking may not be immediate but will manifest over time. This reflects the biblical theme of sowing and reaping, where the results of one's actions are seen in the future (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>).<p><b>than one who flatters with his tongue</b><br>Flattery is insincere praise, often used for personal gain or to avoid conflict. The Bible warns against flattery as deceitful and ultimately harmful (<a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2-3</a>, <a href="/proverbs/29-5.htm">Proverbs 29:5</a>). In contrast to rebuke, which seeks the good of the other person, flattery is self-serving. The cultural context of the ancient Near East valued honor and integrity, making flattery a dangerous and dishonorable practice. Jesus, as the embodiment of truth, never resorted to flattery but spoke truthfully, even when it was difficult (<a href="/john/8-45.htm">John 8:45-46</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebuker.htm">The Rebuker</a></b><br>This person is someone who offers correction or criticism, often motivated by a desire to help the other person improve or avoid error.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flatterer.htm">The Flatterer</a></b><br>This individual uses insincere praise to gain favor or avoid conflict, often prioritizing their own interests over the truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipient_of_rebuke.htm">The Recipient of Rebuke</a></b><br>The person who receives correction, who may initially react negatively but ultimately benefits from the truth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipient_of_flattery.htm">The Recipient of Flattery</a></b><br>The person who receives insincere praise, which may lead to complacency or a false sense of security.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_rebuke.htm">The Event of Rebuke</a></b><br>The act of offering correction, which can be a pivotal moment leading to personal growth and improved relationships.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_truthful_correction.htm">The Value of Truthful Correction</a></b><br>Honest rebuke, though initially uncomfortable, leads to long-term respect and favor.

The suffix cannot be that of the first person singular, which would give no sense; hence most interpreters see in it a peculiar adverb attached to the following verb, "shall afterwards find." Delitzsch. Lowenstein, end Nowack take it for a noun with the termination <span class="accented">-ai</span>, and translate, "a man that goeth backward," "a backslider" (as <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>).

A faithful counsellor, who tells a man his faults, brings them home to his conscience, and checks him in his downward course, will be seen to be a true friend, and will be loved and respected both by the one whom he has warned and advised and by all who are well disposed. <a href="/james/5-19.htm">James 5:19</a>, "If any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him. let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and stroll hide a multitude of sins." "Laudat adulator, sed non est verus amator." The flatterer says only what is agreeable to the man whom he flatters, and thus makes him conceited and selfish and unable to see himself as he really is: the true friend says harsh things, but they are wholesome and tend to spiritual profit, and show more real affection than all the soft words of the fawning parasite.
