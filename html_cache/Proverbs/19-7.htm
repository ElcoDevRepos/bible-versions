The term "brothers" here can refer to both literal siblings and extended family or close kin. The use of "hate" indicates a strong aversion or neglect, highlighting the societal tendency to distance oneself from those who are impoverished. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the challenges faced by the poor, as seen in <a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-14</a>, where Job laments the abandonment by his family and friends during his time of suffering. The verse underscores the harsh reality of social dynamics where wealth often dictates relationships.<p><b>how much more do his friends avoid him!</b><br>Friends, unlike family, are not bound by blood and thus may feel even less obligation to maintain a relationship with someone who is poor. This phrase emphasizes the fickle nature of human relationships based on material wealth. In the cultural context of the time, friendships were often formed for mutual benefit, and poverty could sever these ties. This is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/14-20.htm">Proverbs 14:20</a>, which similarly notes the isolation of the poor. The avoidance by friends serves as a warning against placing trust in human relationships over divine provision and faithfulness.<p><b>He may pursue them with pleading,</b><br>The image of the poor man pursuing his friends with pleading suggests desperation and vulnerability. This pursuit indicates an active effort to seek help or companionship, highlighting the poor man's awareness of his social isolation. The act of pleading can be seen as a form of supplication, akin to the biblical practice of seeking mercy or favor, as seen in the Psalms. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of the marginalized crying out for justice and support, as in <a href="/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12-14</a>, where the righteous king is called to deliver the needy.<p><b>but they are nowhere to be found.</b><br>This phrase completes the picture of abandonment, illustrating the futility of the poor man's efforts to reconnect with those who once were close. The absence of friends in times of need contrasts with the biblical ideal of steadfast love and loyalty, as exemplified by Jonathan's friendship with David (<a href="/1_samuel/18.htm">1 Samuel 18:1-4</a>). It serves as a reminder of the transient nature of human relationships and the need for reliance on God, who is described as a "friend who sticks closer than a brother" (<a href="/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>). This absence also foreshadows the ultimate rejection faced by Christ, who was abandoned by His disciples in His hour of need (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_man.htm">The Poor Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who lack material wealth and resources.

Scripture calls us to steady, sacrificial love that reflects Christ&#8212;standing with the poor, meeting practical needs, and proving that true friendship endures when every worldly advantage is gone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to Him.--</span>The first half of a verse has apparently dropped out here.

"Every one who hateth a poor brother will be also far from friendship." Then follows an addition not found m the Hebrew, "Good thought draweth nigh to those who know it, and a prudent man will find it. He who doeth much evil brings malice to perfection (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); and he who rouses words to anger shall not be safe." <span class="cmt_word">He pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him;</span> or, <span class="accented">they are gone.</span> He makes a pathetic appeal to his quondam friends, but they hearken not to him. But the sense is rather, "He pursueth after, craves for, words of kindness or promises of help, and there is naught, or he gets words only and no material aid." Wordsworth quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 38:5 - <p><span class="foreign">"Quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,<br />Qua solatus es adlocutione?<br />Irascor tibi. Sic meos amores?"</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit</span>, "He who pursues words only shall have naught." The Hebrew is literally, "Seeking words, they are not" This is according to the Khetib; the Keri, instead of the negation <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, which makes the clause signify, "He who pursues words, they are to him;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gets words and nothing else. Delitzsch and others, supplying the lost member from the Septuagint, read the third line thus: "He that hath many friends, or the friend of every one, is requited with evil; and he that seeketh (fair) speeches shall not be delivered." Cheyne also makes a distich of this line, taking the Septuagint as representing the original reading, "He that does much evil perfects mischief: He that provokes with words shall not escape." That something has fallen out of the Hebrew text is evident; it seems that there are no examples of tristichs in this part of our book, though they are not unknown in the first and third divisions. The Vulgate surmounts the difficulty by connecting this third line with the following verse, which thus is made to form the antithesis, <span class="accented">Qui tantum verba sectatur, nihil habebit</span>;
