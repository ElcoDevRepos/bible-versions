In the ancient Near Eastern context, wealth was often seen as a sign of divine favor, leading the rich to believe in their own wisdom and understanding. This self-perception can lead to arrogance, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>, which warns against being wise in one's own eyes. The Bible frequently cautions against the deceitfulness of riches (<a href="/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>) and the false security they provide (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>). The rich man's self-assessment is contrasted with God's perspective, which values humility and dependence on Him (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>but a poor man with discernment sees through him</b><br>The poor man, despite his lack of material wealth, possesses discernment, a valued trait in biblical wisdom literature. Discernment is the ability to judge well and is often associated with spiritual insight and understanding (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>). This phrase suggests that true wisdom is not dependent on wealth but on one's relationship with God and the ability to see beyond outward appearances. The poor man's discernment allows him to see the reality of the rich man's situation, echoing Jesus' teachings in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>), where the poor in spirit are blessed. This insight aligns with the biblical principle that God often chooses the lowly and despised to shame the wise and strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<div

is not condemned; misplaced confidence in it is (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>).<p>- Verse 11 nests in a cluster of warnings against self-reliance and urges dependence on the Lord

&#8220;The wealth of the rich is their fortified city&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/18-11.htm">Proverbs 18:11</a>).<p>- Such self-confidence blinds a person to his true need of God, echoing <a

A rich man thinks so highly of his position, is so flattered by parasites, and deems himself placed so immeasurably above social inferiors, that he learns to consider himself possessed of other qualifications, even mental and intellectual gifts, with which wealth has no concern. This purse-proud arrogance which looks upon financial skill and sharpness in bargaining as true wisdom, is confined to no age or country. <span class="cmt_word">But the poor man that hath understanding searcheth him out</span> (<a href="/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a>). Wisdom is not to be bought with money. A poor man may be wise, his poverty probably making him a keener critic; and if he is brought into communication with this self-deluding plutocrat, he soon sees through him and recognizes his real value.
