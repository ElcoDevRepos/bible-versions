Trust in the LORD is a central theme throughout the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3-5</a> and <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. In the historical context of ancient Israel, trust in God was crucial for navigating the challenges of life, including threats from surrounding nations and internal moral decay. The LORD, Yahweh, is the covenant name of God, reminding the reader of His faithfulness and the promises made to the patriarchs. This trust is not merely intellectual assent but involves a relational reliance on God's character and promises.<p><b>I instruct you today</b><br>The immediacy of "today" underscores the urgency and relevance of the instruction. Wisdom in Proverbs is often portrayed as a present need, not something to be deferred. The use of "I instruct" suggests a personal and direct communication, akin to a father teaching a son, which is a common motif in Proverbs (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8, 4</a>:1). This reflects the cultural practice of oral teaching and the importance of passing down wisdom through generations. The instruction is meant to be practical and applicable to daily life, aligning with the biblical principle that God's Word is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p><b>yes, you</b><br>The emphasis on "you" personalizes the message, making it clear that the instruction is not just for a general audience but for each individual reader or listener. This personal address is a rhetorical device used throughout Scripture to engage the audience directly, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, where Moses calls the Israelites to choose life. It highlights the personal responsibility each person has in responding to God's wisdom. In a broader theological sense, it points to the personal relationship God desires with each believer, a theme fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who calls His followers individually by name (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The words, "this day," recall the warning of <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm" title="But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.">Hebrews 3:13</a>, and the emphatic "to thee, even to thee," imply that the message of God, though it may be [general in its form, yet is addressed to each individual soul among His people (comp., "Ho, every one that thirsteth," <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>); each being well known, and an object of love on the part of his Redeemer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thy trust may be in the Lord.</span> The Greek and Latin versions make this clause depend on the preceding verse. It is better to consider it as dependent on the second hemistich, the fact of instruction being placed after the statement of its object. All the instruction herein afforded is meant to teach that entire confidence in the Lord which, as soon as his will is known and understood, leads a man to do it at any cost or pains, leaving the result in God's hands. <span class="cmt_word">I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee.</span> The repetition of the personal pronoun brings home the teaching to the disciple, and shows that it is addressed, not merely to the mass of men, but to each individual among them, who thus becomes responsible for the use which he makes of it (comp. <a href="/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15</a>). The expression, "this day," further emphasizes the exhortation. The learner is not to remember vaguely that some time or other he received this instruction, but that on this particular day the warning was given. So in <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7, 13</a> we read, "As the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.... Exhort one another daily, so long as it is called Today, lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin." Septuagint, "That thy hope may be in the Lord, and he may make thy way known unto thee." Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') quotes Biekell's correction of this verse, "That thy confidence may be in Jehovah, to make known unto thee thy ways;" but the alteration seems arbitrary and unnecessary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/22-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So that your trust</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1496;&#1463;&#1495;&#1462;&#1425;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7687;&#183;&#7789;a&#183;&#7717;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4009.htm">Strong's 4009: </a> </span><span class="str2">A refuge, security, assurance</span><br /><br /><span class="word">may be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(lih&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1453;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have instructed you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - first person common singular &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">today,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_637.htm">Strong's 637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Meaning accession, yea, adversatively though</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;t&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/22-19.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 22:19 That your trust may be in Yahweh (Prov.
