Throughout Scripture, the importance of adhering strictly to God's commands is highlighted. In <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18-19</a>, similar warnings are given against altering divine revelation. This reflects the belief that God's Word is complete and perfect, needing no human addition. Historically, the Israelites were surrounded by cultures with mutable religious texts, but they were called to maintain the purity of God's revelation. This principle underscores the importance of Scripture as the ultimate authority in faith and practice.<p><b>lest He rebuke you</b><br>The concept of divine rebuke is prevalent in the Bible, often associated with correction and discipline. In <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>, God's rebuke is seen as a form of loving discipline for His children. The rebuke here serves as a warning against the pride and presumption of altering God's Word. It reflects the biblical theme that God is actively involved in guiding and correcting His people, ensuring they remain faithful to His truth. This rebuke is not merely punitive but serves to realign individuals with God's will.<p><b>and prove you a liar</b><br>This phrase highlights the consequences of distorting God's Word. In biblical terms, a liar is someone who misrepresents the truth, as seen in <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, where lying is associated with the devil. The integrity of God's Word is paramount, and any deviation from it is equated with falsehood. This serves as a reminder of the importance of truthfulness and the dangers of false teaching, which is a recurring theme in the New Testament, particularly in the pastoral epistles. The ultimate truth is found in Jesus Christ, who is described as "the way, the truth, and the life" in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, and any deviation from His teachings is considered a lie.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/agur.htm">Agur</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>, Agur son of Jakeh, is a figure about whom little is known.
