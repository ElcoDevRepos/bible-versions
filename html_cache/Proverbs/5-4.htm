The imagery of "bitter as wormwood" draws from the ancient understanding of wormwood as a plant known for its intensely bitter taste, often associated with sorrow and calamity. In biblical times, wormwood was a symbol of judgment and suffering (<a href="/lamentations/3-15.htm">Lamentations 3:15</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-11.htm">Revelation 8:11</a>). This bitterness contrasts with the initial allure of sin, highlighting the deceptive nature of temptation. The cultural context of the time would have understood this bitterness as a warning against the seductive but ultimately destructive nature of immoral relationships.<p><b>sharp as a double-edged sword</b><br>The comparison to a "double-edged sword" conveys the idea of danger and harm. In ancient warfare, a double-edged sword was a powerful weapon, capable of cutting in both directions, symbolizing the potential for severe damage. This metaphor underscores the perilous consequences of engaging in sinful behavior, which can lead to spiritual and emotional destruction. The imagery of a sword is also used in other scriptures to represent the Word of God (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>), which discerns and judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart. This duality suggests that while God's Word is life-giving, the path of sin is destructive. The historical context of this imagery would resonate with an audience familiar with the lethal efficiency of such a weapon, reinforcing the seriousness of the warning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

She promises enjoyment, pleasure, freedom from danger, but <span class="cmt_word">her end is bitter as wormwood.</span> "Her end," not merely with reference to herself, which may be and is undoubtedly true, but the last of her as experienced by those who have intercourse with her - her character as it stands revealed at the last. So it is said of wine, "At the last," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its final effects, if indulged in to excess, "it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder" (<a href="/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22</a>). <span class="accented">Bitter as wormwood.</span> The Hebrew, <span class="accented">laanah</span>, "wormwood," Gesenius derives from the unused root <span class="accented">laan</span>, "to curse." It is the equivalent to the <span class="accented">absinthium</span> of the Vulgate. So Aquila, who has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The LXX. improperly renders <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, "gall." In other places the word <span class="accented">laanah</span> is used as the emblem of bitterness, with the superadded idea of its being poisonous, also according to the Hebrew notion, shared in also by the Greeks, that the plant combined these two qualities. Thus in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a> it is associated with <span class="accented">rosh</span>, "a poisonful herb" (margin), and the Targum terms it, agreeably with this notion, "deadly wormwood." The same belief is reproduced in <a href="/revelation/8-11.htm">Revelation 8:11</a>, "And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>: 6:12). The apostle, no doubt, has it in mind when he speaks of any "root of bitterness," in <a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>. The herb is thus described by Umbreit: "It is a plant toward two feet high, belonging to the genus <span class="accented">Artemisia</span> (species <span class="accented">Artemisia absinthium</span>), which produces a very firm stalk with many branches, grayish leaves, and small, almost round, pendent blossoms. It has a bitter and saline taste, and seems to have been regarded in the East as also a poison, of which the frequent combination with <span class="accented">rosh</span> gives an intimation." Terence has a strikingly similar passage to the one before us - <p><span class="accented">In melle sunt linguae sitae vestrae atque orations<br />Lacteque; corda felle sunt lita atque acerbo aceto."</span> Your tongues are placed in honey and your speech is milk; your hearts are besmeared with gall and sharp vinegar ('Trucul.,' 1:11. 75). <span class="cmt_word">Sharp as a two-edged sword;</span> literally, <span class="accented">as a sword of edges</span> (<span class="accented">kherev piphiyyoth</span>), which may mean a sword of extreme sharpness. Her end is as sharp as the sharpest sword. But it seems better to take the term as it is understood in the Authorized Version, which has the support both of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">gladius biceps</span>, and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a two-edged sword." Compare "a two-edged sword" (<span class="accented">kherev piphiyyoth</span>) of <a href="/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>.
