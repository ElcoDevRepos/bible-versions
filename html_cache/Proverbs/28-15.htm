In biblical times, lions were known to inhabit the regions of the Near East, and their roar was a symbol of impending threat. This metaphor is used to describe the nature of a wicked ruler, suggesting that such a leader instills fear and terror among the people. The lion's roar can also be seen as a symbol of Satan's tactics, as described in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where the devil is likened to a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.<p><b>or a charging bear</b><br>Bears, like lions, were part of the wildlife in ancient Israel and were known for their strength and aggression, especially when provoked or protecting their young. The comparison to a charging bear emphasizes the sudden and overwhelming force that a wicked ruler can exert. This imagery is used to convey the idea of a ruler who is unpredictable and dangerous, capable of causing great harm without warning. The bear's charge can be likened to the suddenness of judgment or calamity, as seen in other biblical passages such as <a href="/hosea/13-8.htm">Hosea 13:8</a>.<p><b>is a wicked ruler</b><br>The term "wicked ruler" refers to a leader who acts unjustly, oppresses the people, and governs with selfish motives. In the biblical context, rulers were expected to uphold justice and righteousness, as seen in the examples of King David and King Solomon. However, wicked rulers, like those described in the books of Kings and Chronicles, often led the nation into idolatry and moral decay. The Bible frequently warns against such leaders, highlighting the importance of godly leadership that aligns with divine principles.<p><b>over a helpless people</b><br>The phrase "helpless people" indicates a populace that is vulnerable and unable to defend itself against the tyranny of a wicked ruler. In ancient times, the common people often had little power or recourse against oppressive governance. This vulnerability is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God is portrayed as the defender of the weak and the oppressed, as seen in Psalms 82:3-4. The helplessness of the people underscores the need for righteous leadership and divine intervention to bring justice and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/roaring_lion.htm">Roaring Lion</a></b><br>In biblical literature, lions often symbolize power, ferocity, and danger.

A wicked ruler terrorizes and crushes those least able to defend themselves. Scripture calls leaders to shepherd, not devour; when they instead roar and charge, the vulnerable suffer. The verse is a sober warning to rulers and a comfort to the afflicted, affirming that God sees and names such injustice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">A ranging bear</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>wandering hungrily in great want of food.<p><span class= "bld">Over the poor people</span>--i.e., a people too weak to resist him, over whom he can tyrannise without fear.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wicked ruler over the poor people;</span> a people weak and resourceless.

They are like lions in strength and cruelty, like bears in craft and ferocity. Septuagint, "A hungry lion and a thirsty wolf is he, who, being poor, rules over an indigent nation."
