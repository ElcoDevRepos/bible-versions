In biblical times, the "head" often symbolized the whole person or life, indicating that blessings encompass all aspects of the righteous person's life. The imagery of blessings being "on the head" may also evoke the anointing of kings and priests, signifying honor and divine approval. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where anointing the head with oil symbolizes abundance and favor. The righteous are often contrasted with the wicked throughout Proverbs, emphasizing the moral and spiritual rewards of living a life aligned with God's commandments.<p><b>but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence</b><br>The "mouth" here represents speech and communication, highlighting how the wicked use their words to hide their true intentions. This phrase suggests deceit and treachery, as the wicked may speak peaceably while harboring violent plans. The concept of concealing violence can be linked to the broader biblical theme of hypocrisy and falsehood, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>, where Jesus condemns the Pharisees for their outward appearance of righteousness while being inwardly corrupt. The contrast between the righteous and the wicked in this verse underscores the moral dichotomy present throughout the book of Proverbs, where the consequences of one's character and actions are consistently explored.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, the righteous are those who live according to God's laws and principles.

God openly crowns the righteous with favor that others can see, reaffirming His commitment to reward obedience. The wicked, by contrast, may skillfully mask their destructive intentions with words, yet their speech itself betrays a heart bent on harm. The verse calls us to pursue righteous living that invites God&#8217;s blessing and to beware of speech that cloaks violence, remembering that every heart will ultimately be laid bare before the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</span>--Curses and deeds of violence have proceeded from his mouth, but God frustrates them, they "return unto him void" (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm" title="So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.">Isaiah 55:11</a>), and, as it were, stop his mouth, reducing him to silence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</span> So Ver. 11. This is usually explained to mean either that the consciousness of his own iniquity silences the sinner when he would speak against the righteous, or his violence and injustice, returning on his own head, are like a bandage over his mouth (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>), reducing him to shame and silence. Others, again, consider the signification to be - in default of the good, honest words which should proceed from a man's mouth, the sinner pours forth injustice and wickedness. But it is best (as in Ver. 14) to take "mouth" as the subject: "The mouth of the wicked concealeth violence," that he may wait for the opportunity of practising it. The contrast is between the manifest blessedness of the righteous and the secret sinister proceedings of the evil. The Vulgate and Septuagint give, "the blessing of the Lord."
