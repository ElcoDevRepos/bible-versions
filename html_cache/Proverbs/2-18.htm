The "house" symbolizes her domain or influence, which leads to spiritual and moral decay. In biblical context, the house is often a metaphor for one's life or family (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>). The imagery of sinking suggests a gradual decline, emphasizing the deceptive nature of sin. The concept of death here is not just physical but spiritual, aligning with <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, which states that the wages of sin is death. This reflects the ultimate separation from God, a theme consistent throughout Scripture.<p><b>and her tracks to the departed spirits</b><br>The "tracks" or paths indicate the direction and outcome of following her ways. In ancient Near Eastern culture, paths were often used metaphorically to describe one's life choices and moral direction (<a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). The term "departed spirits" refers to Sheol, the abode of the dead in Hebrew thought, a place of darkness and separation from the living (<a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>). This highlights the seriousness of the consequences, as it leads to a state of spiritual death and separation from God. The warning is clear: choosing the path of folly and immorality leads to destruction, a theme echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who spoke of the broad road leading to destruction (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adulterous_woman.htm">The Adulterous Woman</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, she symbolizes temptation and the allure of sin, leading individuals away from wisdom and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>Represents the dwelling or domain of the adulterous woman, metaphorically indicating a place of spiritual and moral decay.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Not just physical death, but spiritual death, separation from God, and the ultimate consequence of living a life contrary to His wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/departed_spirits.htm">Departed Spirits (Sheol)</a></b><br>In Hebrew, "Sheol" refers to the realm of the dead, a place of darkness and separation from the living and from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_temptation.htm">The Danger of Temptation</a></b><br>Recognize that temptation often appears attractive but leads to spiritual death and separation from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_wisdom.htm">The Importance of Wisdom</a></b><br>Pursue wisdom and discernment to avoid the paths that lead to destruction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_heart.htm">Guarding the Heart</a></b><br>Be vigilant in guarding your heart against influences that draw you away from God's truth and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Understand that sin has real and severe consequences, not just in this life but in the life to come.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_path.htm">Seeking God's Path</a></b><br>Commit to seeking God's path, which leads to life, rather than the deceptive paths that lead to death.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_2_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 2:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_2_18_s_warning_on_death_s_path.htm">How does Proverbs 2:18 warn against the path leading to death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prevent_house_destruction.htm">What actions can protect us from the "house" leading to destruction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_2_18_vs_Jesus_narrow_path.htm">How does Proverbs 2:18 connect with Jesus' teachings on the narrow path?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_the_house_in_Proverbs_2_18.htm">What practical steps help avoid the "house" described in Proverbs 2:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_paths_to_life_not_death.htm">How can we discern paths leading to life versus those leading to death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_2_18_Consequences_of_wrong_path.htm">What does Proverbs 2:18 imply about the consequences of following the wrong path?

The objection to the Authorized Version is that it does not tbllow the construction of the original, the verb "sinks down" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">shakhah</span>) being feminine, while "house" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">bayith</span>) is invariably masculine. Aben Ezra translates, "She sinks down to death, (which is to be) her house;" but it seems better to regard "her house" as an adjunct of the strange woman. Her house includes all who belong to her. She and they are involved in the same fate. The Authorized Version is evidently influenced by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Inclinata est enim ad mortem domus ejus</span>, "For her house is inclined to death." The LXX. gives a different rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For she hath placed her house beside death." So the Arabic. The "for" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="accented">ki</span>) refers back to ver. 16, and indicates how great is the deliverance effected by wisdom. The meaning of the passage is aptly illustrated by <a href="/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>, "Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death." <span class="cmt_word">And her paths unto the dead.</span> <span class="accented">The dead</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">r'phaim</span>) are properly the quiet, or the feeble.
