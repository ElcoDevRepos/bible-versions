In the ancient Near Eastern context, ants were observed for their industrious nature. Despite their small size, they accomplish significant tasks, which serves as a metaphor for the power of collective effort and foresight. This phrase highlights the theme of humility and the idea that strength is not always measured by physical power but by wisdom and perseverance.<p><b>yet they store up their food in the summer;</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the ants' ability to plan and prepare for the future. In the agrarian society of biblical times, storing food was crucial for survival, especially during the harsh winter months when resources were scarce. The ants' behavior is a model of prudence and foresight, encouraging believers to be wise stewards of their resources. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>, which also commends the ant's diligence. The ants' preparation can be seen as a type of spiritual readiness, urging believers to be prepared for future challenges and to trust in God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ants.htm">Ants</a></b><br>Small insects known for their industrious nature and ability to work collectively.

By highlighting them again in <a href="/bsb/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>, the Spirit underscores that wisdom is often found in the ordinary and overlooked (see also <a href="/proverbs/30-24.htm">Proverbs 30:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are creatures of little strength</b><p>Measured by muscle or size, an ant is insignificant. Scripture frequently reminds us that God delights in working through what the world counts weak&#8212;&#8220;God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). Their apparent frailty parallels our own dependence on the Lord (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>). The lesson: limited resources or stature never excuse inaction or sluggishness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet</b><p>That tiny word carries a holy contrast. Though small, ants accomplish big tasks. Likewise, &#8220;we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this surpassingly great power is from God and not from us&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).

Every believer has God-appointed windows&#8212;relationships, health, freedom&#8212;to seize now, because &#8220;there is a time for every purpose under heaven&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25</a> lifts the ant as a living parable: small bodies, big lessons.

The humble ant shows that faithful industry, anchored in trust, turns weakness into God-glorifying strength.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ants are a people not strong.</span> The ant is proposed as an example to the sluggard (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6</a>, etc.). He calls the ants a people, <span class="accented">am</span>, because they live in a community, and have authorities which they obey, and their actions are regulated by certain definite laws. So Joel (<a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>) calls the locusts a nation, and Homer ('Iliad,' 2:87) speaks of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the tribes of thronging bees." <span class="cmt_word">Yet they prepare their meat in the summer.</span> In countries where ants hybernate the object of this commended foresight is mistaken; but the statement, as that in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>, is in accordance with the popular belief of the day, and serves well to point the moral intended. We know certainly that in Europe these insects fill their nests with heterogeneous articles - grain, seeds, husks, etc., not as stores to be consumed in the winter, but for warmth and comfort's sake. Scripture is not intended to teach science; it speaks of such matters phenomenally, with no attempt at a precision which would not have been understood or appreciated by contemporaries. But in the present case more careful observation has confirmed the correctness of the asset. tions in our proverbs. In countries where, ants do not hybernate, they do make granaries for themselves in the summer, and use these supplies as food in the winter months (see note on Proverbs 6:8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/30-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the ants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1453;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#601;&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5244.htm">Strong's 5244: </a> </span><span class="str2">An ant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a strong</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1425;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5794.htm">Strong's 5794: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strong, vehement, harsh</span><br /><br /><span class="word">species,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">yet they store up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3559.htm">Strong's 3559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be erect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#7717;&#183;m&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the summer;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;aq&#183;qa&#183;yi&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7019.htm">Strong's 7019: </a> </span><span class="str2">To awake</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/30-25.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 30:25 The ants are not a strong people (Prov.
