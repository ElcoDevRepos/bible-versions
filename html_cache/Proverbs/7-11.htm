In the biblical context, loudness often symbolizes a lack of self-control and wisdom, contrasting with the quiet and gentle spirit praised in other scriptures (<a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>). The defiance indicates a willful rejection of societal norms and divine commandments, reminiscent of Israel's frequent rebellion against God (<a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a>). This behavior is contrary to the Proverbs' ideal of a wise and virtuous woman, who is described as having strength and dignity (<a href="/proverbs/31-25.htm">Proverbs 31:25</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel valued modesty and obedience, especially in women, making this depiction a warning against such traits.<p><b>her feet do not remain at home.</b><br>This phrase suggests restlessness and a lack of contentment with one's domestic responsibilities. In ancient Israel, a woman's primary domain was the home, where she was expected to manage household affairs and nurture her family (<a href="/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27</a>). The imagery of wandering feet implies a pursuit of illicit activities and a neglect of familial duties, echoing the warnings against adultery and unfaithfulness found throughout Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/5-8.htm">Proverbs 5:8</a>). This restlessness can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual unfaithfulness, as Israel often strayed from God to pursue other deities (<a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>). Theologically, it serves as a caution against the dangers of leaving one's God-given role and responsibilities, highlighting the importance of faithfulness and stability.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adulterous_woman.htm">The Adulterous Woman</a></b><br>This verse is part of a larger passage warning against the seduction of an adulterous woman. She is portrayed as a personification of temptation and folly, leading others away from wisdom and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The author of Proverbs, traditionally believed to be King Solomon, who is imparting wisdom to his son and, by extension, to all readers. His teachings often contrast wisdom with folly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_streets.htm">The Streets</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a> describes the woman as being in the streets, symbolizing a place of danger and temptation away from the safety of home.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_defiance.htm">The Dangers of Defiance</a></b><br>Defiance against God's wisdom leads to spiritual and moral peril.

This isn&#8217;t about extroversion; it signals a brazen, attention-seeking spirit that ignores the quiet, wisdom-filled demeanor praised elsewhere (<a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-26.htm">Proverbs 31:26</a>).<p>- Such loudness hints at disorder (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>) and stands in contrast to the peaceful, gentle speech Scripture commends (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>).<p>- The warning: unchecked clamor often precedes temptation. Like the &#8220;woman Folly&#8221; who &#8220;is loud&#8221; in <a href="/proverbs/9-13.htm">Proverbs 9:13</a>, noise can drown out the still, small voice of God (<a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She is defiant</b><p>- &#8220;Defiant&#8221; conveys refusal to submit. <a href="/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a> lifts up self-control and submission as virtues; this woman embodies their opposite.<p>- Defiance resists God-ordained boundaries (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>) and mirrors the rebellious spirit of Israel in <a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>.<p>- The narrative of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a> casts her as a lure toward sin; defiance here actively undermines godly authority and invites moral chaos (<a href="/proverbs/6-20.htm">Proverbs 6:20-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Her feet do not remain at home</b><p>- Restlessness replaces the steady faithfulness of the <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a> woman who &#8220;looks well to the ways of her household&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27</a>).<p>- Wandering opens doors to temptation (<a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1-4</a>) and is linked to idleness condemned in <a href="/1_timothy/5-13.htm">1 Timothy 5:13</a>.<p>- The contrast: wisdom often calls us to contentment in our God-given sphere (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11</a>) rather than the thrill of the next illicit encounter (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a> sketches a composite of temptation: loud words that stifle wisdom, a defiant heart that rejects authority, and restless feet that roam into sin&#8217;s territory.
