It suggests a temporary relief for those in distress. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, wine was often used for medicinal purposes and to provide comfort. The Bible acknowledges the use of wine for joy and relief (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>), but also warns against its excess (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). This phrase does not advocate for drunkenness but recognizes the human need for solace in times of hardship.<p><b>and forget his poverty</b><br>Poverty in biblical times was a significant social issue, often leading to a lack of basic necessities. The idea of forgetting poverty through drink suggests a temporary escape from the harsh realities of life. This reflects the broader biblical theme of seeking God's provision and comfort in times of need (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). The Bible consistently calls for compassion and justice for the poor (<a href="/proverbs/29-7.htm">Proverbs 29:7</a>), emphasizing the importance of community support and divine reliance.<p><b>and remember his misery no more</b><br>Misery here refers to the emotional and physical suffering associated with poverty and hardship. The Bible frequently addresses the plight of the suffering, offering hope and encouragement (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17-18</a>). This phrase highlights the human desire to find relief from pain, pointing to the ultimate comfort found in God (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>). While temporary relief is acknowledged, the Bible ultimately directs believers to seek lasting peace and joy in their relationship with God (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_lemuel.htm">King Lemuel</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, who shares the wisdom taught to him by his mother.
