In ancient agrarian societies, fallow ground referred to land that was left unplanted to restore its fertility. The poor, often lacking resources to cultivate their land, still possess the potential for abundance. This reflects the biblical principle that God provides for all, and even the least likely places can yield great blessings. The concept of fallow ground is also a metaphor for spiritual readiness, as seen in <a href="/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>, where breaking up fallow ground symbolizes preparing one's heart for righteousness.<p><b>but without justice it is swept away</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the importance of justice in maintaining and realizing potential. In biblical times, justice was a central theme, often associated with righteousness and fairness. The absence of justice can lead to the loss of resources and opportunities, as corruption and exploitation prevent the poor from benefiting from their potential. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes God's concern for justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, which calls for defending the oppressed. The sweeping away of resources without justice serves as a warning against societal structures that perpetuate inequality and highlights the need for godly governance and stewardship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>This refers to individuals who lack material wealth or resources.

The word rendered "tillage" (<span class="accented">nir</span>) means ground worked for the first time, and therefore that on which much labour is bestowed.
