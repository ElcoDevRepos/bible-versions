In ancient Hebrew culture, education was primarily the responsibility of the family, particularly the parents. The Hebrew word used here, "chanak," can also mean to dedicate or initiate, suggesting a formal commitment to the child's moral and spiritual development. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to diligently teach God's commandments to their children.<p><b>in the way he should go</b><br>This phrase suggests a path or direction that is appropriate for the child. It implies understanding the child's unique personality, gifts, and calling. The "way" can also be interpreted as the path of righteousness and wisdom, as outlined throughout the book of Proverbs. This aligns with the biblical principle of living according to God's commandments and wisdom, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp to one's feet and a light to one's path.<p><b>and when he is old</b><br>The phrase "when he is old" indicates the long-term impact of early training. In biblical times, the concept of age was often associated with maturity and wisdom. The expectation is that the foundational teachings imparted during childhood will endure into adulthood. This reflects the biblical understanding of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where the seeds sown in youth bear fruit in later life.<p><b>he will not depart from it</b><br>This promise suggests a lasting adherence to the teachings and values instilled during childhood. It reflects the belief in the enduring power of godly instruction and the work of the Holy Spirit in maintaining one's path. While this is a general principle rather than an absolute guarantee, it underscores the importance of early spiritual and moral education. This concept is echoed in <a href="/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14-15</a>, where Timothy is reminded of the sacred writings he has known since childhood, which are able to make him wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The verb is not passive; it pictures shaping, dedicating, and initiating&#8212;much like dedicating a house (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>) or setting apart a priest (<a href="/numbers/8-11.htm">Numbers 8:11</a>). For parents and mentors, that means:<p>&#8226; Regular instruction, not occasional comments (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Modeling truth in daily life (<a href="/philippians/4-9.htm">Philippians 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Loving correction when needed (<a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>).<p>The New Testament echoes the same spirit: &#8220;Bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a child</b><p>The target is specifically &#8220;a child,&#8221; not an adult already set in ways. Scripture underscores the strategic value of early influence:<p>&#8226; &#8220;From infancy you have known the sacred Scriptures&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel served the LORD as a boy and grew &#8220;in favor with the LORD and with men&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself &#8220;grew in wisdom and stature&#8221; under godly parents (<a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>).<p>Early years are fertile soil; whatever seeds are planted then tend to take deep root.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the way</b><p>&#8220;The way&#8221; points to a clear path, not multiple options. Proverbs loves this imagery: &#8220;In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>). Scripture defines the way as:<p>&#8226; Morally upright (<a href="/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God-directed rather than self-directed (<a href="/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately found in Christ, who said, &#8220;I am the way&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>Training, then, is not value-neutral; it steers children toward a definite, God-given course.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he should go</b><p>The phrase underscores that the path is fitting to the child&#8217;s God-given design, not his fallen impulses. Parents observe gifts and temperament and channel them toward righteousness:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Start children off on the right path; even when they are old, they will not stray&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to Your word&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9</a>).<p>God equips each child for a purpose; wise training aligns natural abilities with divine calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and when he is old</b><p>The verse looks far down the road, beyond adolescence into seasoned adulthood. Scripture testifies that early truth anchors later life:<p>&#8226; David could say in old age, &#8220;I was young and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Timothy&#8217;s adult ministry rested on faith &#8220;that first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Even a prodigal&#8217;s return (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-20</a>) illustrates that implanted truth can resurface decades later.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will not depart from it</b><p>This is a divine guarantee, not mere optimism. God&#8217;s Word does what it promises: &#8220;My word&#8230; will not return to Me void&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). When parents fulfill their role, God works:<p>&#8226; He completes what He begins (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; His promise is sure, though timing varies (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Wandering seasons may occur, yet the entrenched path remains, tugging the heart back (<a href="/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a>).<p>The verse stands as both comfort and motivation: faithful training yields enduring allegiance to God&#8217;s way.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a> calls parents and mentors to deliberate, early, Scripture-saturated instruction that aligns each child with God&#8217;s ordained path. Such training, planted in tender years, is guarded by God through every life stage so that, in maturity, the once-young learner stays the course. The promise is clear: shape the child with God&#8217;s truth today, and tomorrow that truth will shape the adult for a lifetime.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Train up a child in the way he should go.</span> The verb translated "train" (<span class="accented">chanak</span>) means, first, "to put something into the mouth," "to give to be tasted," as nurses give to infants food which they have masticated in order to prepare it for their nurslings; thence it comes to signify "to give elementary instruction," "to imbue," "to train." The Hebrew literally is, <span class="accented">Initiate a child in accordance with his way.</span> The Authorized Version, with which Ewald agrees, takes the maxim to mean that the child should be trained from the first in the right path - the path of obedience and religion. This is a very true and valuable rule, but it is not what the author intends. "His way" must mean one of two things - either his future calling and station, or his character and natural inclination and capacity. Delitzsch and Plumptre take the latter interpretation; Nowack and Bertheau the former, on the ground that <span class="accented">derek</span> is not used in the other sense suggested. But, as far as use is concerned, both explanations stand on much the same ground; and it seems more in conformity with the moralist's age and nation to see in the maxim an injunction to consider the child's nature, faculties, and temperament, in the education which is given to him. If, from his early years, a child is thus trained, <span class="cmt_word">when he is old, he will not depart from it.</span> This way, this education in accordance with his idiosyncrasy, will bear fruit all his life long; it will become a second nature, and will never be obliterated. The Vulgate commences the verse with <span class="accented">Proverbium est</span>, taking the first word substantively, as if the author here cited a trite saying; but the rendering is a mistake. There are similar maxims, common at all times and in all countries.
