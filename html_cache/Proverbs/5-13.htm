In ancient Israel, teachers were often elders or those with experience in the Law and life, emphasizing the value of generational wisdom. The failure to listen is a common biblical warning, seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>, where the Israelites did not listen to God&#8217;s prophets. This reflects a broader biblical principle that wisdom and instruction are vital for a righteous life, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, where the Shema instructs Israel to listen and obey God's commandments.<p><b>or incline my ear to my mentors</b><br>The act of inclining one's ear suggests a deliberate effort to understand and apply wisdom. In the cultural context of the Bible, mentors were often seen as guides in both spiritual and practical matters. The Hebrew culture placed a high value on mentorship, as seen in the relationships between Moses and Joshua, Elijah and Elisha, and Paul and Timothy. This phrase underscores the personal responsibility to seek and apply wisdom, echoing the call in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> to be doers of the word, not just hearers. The failure to do so can lead to folly and destruction, as illustrated in the broader context of <a href="/proverbs/5.htm">Proverbs 5</a>, which warns against the dangers of adultery and the consequences of ignoring wise counsel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_speaker.htm">The Speaker</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is a person reflecting on their past mistakes, particularly their failure to heed wise counsel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/teachers/instructors.htm">Teachers/Instructors</a></b><br>These are figures of authority and wisdom, likely representing parents, mentors, or spiritual leaders who provide guidance and instruction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_proverbs.htm">The Context of Proverbs</a></b><br>Proverbs is a book of wisdom literature in the Old Testament, traditionally attributed to King Solomon.

The proverb assumes that God provides wise teachers&#8212;parents, pastors, seasoned believers&#8212;who speak His truth plainly.<p>&#8226; Ignoring godly counsel is an act of willful rebellion (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a>).<p>&#8226; It shuts the door on life-giving correction that keeps us from sin&#8217;s traps (<a href="/proverbs/15-31.htm">Proverbs 15:31</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; The plea to &#8220;listen&#8221; echoes Moses&#8217; charge to Israel to memorize and recite God&#8217;s words daily (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Hardness of heart grows each time a warning is brushed aside (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>).<p>Like a child covering his ears, the speaker confesses that he chose self-rule over submission to the truth his teachers faithfully delivered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or incline my ear to my mentors</b><p>&#8220;To incline&#8221; pictures leaning in, eager to catch every syllable, much like Mary sitting at Jesus&#8217; feet (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>). Resisting that posture leads to spiritual deafness.<p>&#8226; True mentors point us to the Lord, not themselves (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Humble, teachable ears receive wisdom that guards the soul (<a href="/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1-5</a>; <a href="/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; God holds us accountable for light we refuse (<a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47-48</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: those who refuse counsel &#8220;eat the fruit of their own way&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>), while those who heed it &#8220;dwell securely&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-33.htm">Proverbs 1:33</a>).<p>The lament in <a href="/proverbs/5-13.htm">Proverbs 5:13</a> follows the bitter consequences of adultery described in the chapter. Too late, the speaker recognizes that a simple tilt of the ear toward godly voices would have spared him deep regret.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/5-13.htm">Proverbs 5:13</a> exposes the root of many falls: a stubborn refusal to hear and apply the counsel God graciously provides through trustworthy teachers and mentors. Listening is more than auditory; it is an attitude of humble obedience. The verse calls us to lean in, receive correction, and walk in the protective wisdom of God&#8217;s Word, avoiding the sorrow that comes from shutting our ears to truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me.</span> The ruined profligate admits he was not without teachers and advisers, but that he gave no heed to their warnings and reproofs. <span class="accented">Have not obeyed the voice</span> (<span class="accented">lo-shama'ti b'kol</span>).
