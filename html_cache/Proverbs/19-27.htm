In the biblical context, "instruction" often refers to the teachings of wisdom, which are rooted in the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The Hebrew culture highly valued the role of a teacher or mentor, often seen in the relationship between a father and son. The act of ceasing to hear instruction implies a deliberate choice to turn away from wisdom, which is a recurring theme in Proverbs. This can be connected to the New Testament, where Paul advises Timothy to continue in what he has learned (<a href="/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14</a>).<p><b>my son</b><br>The use of "my son" is a common literary device in Proverbs, indicating a personal and intimate form of address. It reflects the familial context in which wisdom was traditionally passed down. This phrase suggests a relationship of care and responsibility, akin to the relationship between God and His people. In a broader sense, it can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate embodiment of wisdom and the Son of God, offering instruction to His followers.<p><b>you will stray from the words of knowledge</b><br>Straying from the "words of knowledge" implies a departure from truth and understanding. In the historical context, the Israelites were often warned against straying from God's commandments, which were seen as the ultimate source of knowledge and life (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16-18</a>). The phrase suggests a path of moral and spiritual decline, akin to the warnings found in the prophets about Israel's unfaithfulness. In the New Testament, this can be related to the parable of the sower, where some seeds fall away due to lack of understanding (<a href="/matthew/13-19.htm">Matthew 13:19</a>). The "words of knowledge" are ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), offering the ultimate knowledge of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The verb &#8220;cease&#8221; warns against a conscious decision to stop listening, not a passive drift. When a believer plugs his ears to godly counsel, he cuts off the very lifeline God uses to shape wisdom in the heart (<a href="/proverbs/4-13.htm">Proverbs 4:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly urges active, ongoing attentiveness: &#8220;Incline your ear and hear&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>), &#8220;Listen to counsel and accept discipline&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/19-20.htm">Proverbs 19:20</a>). <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a> echoes the same urgency: &#8220;We must pay much closer attention&#8230; so that we do not drift away.&#8221;<p>- Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Keep placing yourself under solid preaching and teaching (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Invite trusted believers to speak correction (<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Guard against pride that resists reproof (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my son</b><p>- The paternal address reminds us that instruction flows from a loving relationship. Solomon writes as a father appealing to his child&#8217;s heart (<a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1</a>).<p>- In Christ, every believer is treated as a beloved child: Paul calls Timothy &#8220;my true son in the faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>), modeling the same mentoring tone.<p>- The phrase reassures us that divine correction is never harsh or distant; it is the Father training those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will stray from the words of knowledge</b><p>- Neglecting instruction has a predictable outcome: wandering. &#8220;Stray&#8221; pictures a gradual, almost unnoticed departure until truth is lost from view (<a href="/jeremiah/14-10.htm">Jeremiah 14:10</a>).<p>- &#8220;Words of knowledge&#8221; points to God-breathed revelation&#8212;Scripture itself (<a href="/proverbs/22-20.htm">Proverbs 22:20&#8211;21</a>). When we stop listening, we drift from the Bible&#8217;s clear path, much like those in <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3&#8211;4</a> who &#8220;turn aside to myths.&#8221;<p>- The result is spiritual vulnerability: &#8220;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). Staying anchored requires daily Scripture intake, eager obedience (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>), and fellowship with truth-speaking believers (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27</a> warns that refusing ongoing instruction is the first step toward drifting from God&#8217;s truth. A childlike, teachable heart keeps us close to the &#8220;words of knowledge,&#8221; while shutting our ears leads inevitably to error and loss. Continual listening, humble submission, and steady engagement with Scripture safeguard the believer from straying and keep us growing in godly wisdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err </span>. . .--Or the passage may mean, <span class= "ital">Cease to hear instruction if you are only going to err afterwards</span>--Make up your mind what you are intending to do hereafter, and act now accordingly; better not know the truth than learn it only to desert it.

But as <span class="accented">musar</span> is used in a good sense throughout this book, it is better to regard the injunction as warning against listening to wise teaching with no intention of profiting by it: "Cease to hear instruction in order to err," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if you are only going to continue your evil doings. You will only increase your guilt by knowing the way of righteousness perfectly, while you refuse to walk therein. The Vulgate inserts a negation, "Cease not to hear doctrine, and be not ignorant of the war, is of knowledge;" Septuagint, "A son who fails to keep the instruction of his father will meditate evil sayings." Solomon's son Rehoboam greatly needed the admonition contained in this verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/19-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If you cease</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1469;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#183;&#7695;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2308.htm">Strong's 2308: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be flabby, desist, be lacking, idle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to hear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#353;&#183;m&#333;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">instruction,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#363;&#183;s&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4148.htm">Strong's 4148: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chastisement, reproof, warning, instruction, restraint</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my son,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you will stray</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1437;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1490;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#353;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7686.htm">Strong's 7686: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stray, to mistake, to transgress, to reel, be enraptured</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1469;&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;im&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_561.htm">Strong's 561: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something said</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of knowledge.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1847.htm">Strong's 1847: </a> </span><span class="str2">Knowledge</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/19-27.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 19:27 If you stop listening to instruction my (Prov.
