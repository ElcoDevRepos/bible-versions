In biblical history, Israel experienced periods of rebellion, such as during the time of the Judges, when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). This led to frequent changes in leadership and a lack of consistent governance. The phrase suggests that when a nation turns away from righteousness, it becomes fragmented, leading to power struggles and a proliferation of leaders, each vying for control. This can be seen in the divided kingdom period after Solomon's reign, where Israel and Judah had multiple kings, often leading to further idolatry and moral decline.<p><b>but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order</b><br>This part of the verse contrasts the chaos of rebellion with the stability brought by wise leadership. A man of understanding and knowledge refers to a leader who fears the Lord and seeks His wisdom, as seen in Solomon's request for wisdom to govern the people (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). Such a leader can bring peace and stability, as they align their governance with God&#8217;s principles. This echoes the biblical theme that true wisdom and understanding come from God (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The phrase also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the embodiment of wisdom and knowledge (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>), who brings order and peace to those who follow Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_in_rebellion.htm">Land in Rebellion</a></b><br>This phrase refers to a nation or community experiencing chaos, disorder, or moral decline.

The history of the northern kingdom of Israel, especially in the disastrous period succeeding the death of Jeroboam II, affords proof of the truth of the statement (comp. <a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>). Septuagint, "Owing to the sins of ungodly men, quarrels (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, lawsuits) arise." <span class="cmt_word">But by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged</span>.

Umbreit, Nowack, and others translate it, "justice," "authority," "order." When a wise and religious man is at the helm of state, justice continues, lives, and works; such a man introduces an clement of enduring good into a land (comp. <a href="/proverbs/21-22.htm">Proverbs 21:22</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:15</a>). The good kings Ass, Jehoshaphat, Uzziah, and Hezekiah had long and prosperous reigns.
