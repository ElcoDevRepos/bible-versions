In biblical context, rulers were expected to uphold justice and truth, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where judges and officials are commanded to judge fairly. The Hebrew word for "listens" implies not just hearing but giving heed or attention, suggesting a ruler's active choice to entertain falsehoods. Historically, rulers like King Ahab, who listened to false prophets (1 Kings 22), demonstrate the destructive consequences of such actions. This phrase warns against the moral decay that begins at the top, reflecting the biblical principle that leaders set the tone for their people (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p><b>all his officials will be wicked</b><br>The phrase suggests a trickle-down effect of corruption. When a leader is swayed by deceit, it creates an environment where dishonesty thrives among subordinates. This mirrors the biblical narrative of King Saul, whose disobedience and insecurity led to a corrupt administration (<a href="/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6-19</a>). The term "wicked" in Hebrew often denotes moral and ethical deviation from God's law, emphasizing the spiritual implications of corrupt leadership. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns against the "blind leading the blind" (<a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>), illustrating the broader impact of ungodly leadership. The phrase serves as a cautionary note on the importance of truth and righteousness in governance, aligning with the biblical call for leaders to be shepherds of integrity (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruler.htm">Ruler</a></b><br>In the context of this proverb, a ruler refers to any person in a position of authority or leadership.
