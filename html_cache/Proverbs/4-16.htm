In biblical context, this reflects the pervasive influence of sin, as seen in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where every inclination of the human heart was only evil all the time. The inability to rest without committing evil acts underscores the depth of their moral depravity. This can be contrasted with the peace and rest promised to the righteous, as seen in <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>, where the faithful can lie down and sleep in safety. The phrase also echoes the idea of spiritual bondage, where sin becomes a master, as Paul describes in <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>.<p><b>they are deprived of slumber until they make someone fall.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the destructive intent of the wicked, who find satisfaction in causing harm to others. The cultural context of ancient Israel viewed sleep as a divine gift and a sign of God's favor, as seen in <a href="/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>. The deprivation of sleep here symbolizes a restless pursuit of malevolence, contrasting with the peace granted to those who follow God's ways. The phrase "make someone fall" can be connected to the broader biblical theme of stumbling blocks, as warned against in <a href="/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a> and further elaborated by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>, where causing others to sin is severely condemned. This reflects the moral responsibility individuals have towards one another, highlighting the antithesis of love and community that the wicked embody.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>This verse refers to those who are characterized by evil actions and intentions.

This is not poetic overstatement but a literal statement of their inner turmoil.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20-21</a> similarly pictures the wicked as &#8220;like the tossing sea, which cannot rest,&#8221; showing that restlessness is the normal state of an unrepentant heart.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/36-4.htm">Psalm 36:4</a> notes, &#8220;Even on his bed he plots evil,&#8221; illustrating how sin invades the night hours.<p>&#8226; The contrast is <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>: &#8220;In peace I will lie down and sleep,&#8221; promised to the righteous who trust the Lord.<p>The point: lack of rest is a spiritual symptom, revealing separation from God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Unless they do evil</b><p>The next phrase, &#8220;unless they do evil,&#8221; exposes the craving that fuels this sleeplessness.

Their sins are not sins of frailty, but arise from premeditation and from their insatiable desire to commit wickedness.

The hiph. is found without any object, as here, in <a href="/2_chronicles/25-8.htm">2 Chronicles 25:8</a>). (On the verb <span class="accented">khasal</span>, from which it is derived, see ch. 4:12.) With the statement of the verse we may compare David's complaint of the persistent persecution of his enemies (<a href="/psalms/59-15.htm">Psalm 59:15</a>), "If they be not satisfied, then will they stay all night" (margin). A similar construction to the one before us occurs in Virgil: "Et si non aliqua nocuisses, mortuus esses" - "And had you not, by some means or other done him an injury, you would have died" ('Eclog.,' 3:15); cf. also Juvenal: "Ergo non aliter poterit dormire; quibusdam somnum rixa facit" - "Therefore, not otherwise, would he have slept; contention to some produces sleep." Hitzig rejects vers. 16 and 17 against all manuscript authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/4-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they cannot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sleep</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1469;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3462.htm">Strong's 3462: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be slack, languid, sleep, to grow old, stale, inveterate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">unless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they do evil,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1425;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7489.htm">Strong's 7489: </a> </span><span class="str2">To spoil, to make, good for, nothing, bad</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they are deprived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1504;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1494;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ni&#7713;&#183;z&#601;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1497.htm">Strong's 1497: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pluck off, to flay, strip, rob</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of slumber</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1437;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8142.htm">Strong's 8142: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sleep</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they make someone fall,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7733;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3782.htm">Strong's 3782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To totter, waver, to falter, stumble, faint, fall</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/4-16.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 4:16 For they don't sleep unless they do (Prov.
