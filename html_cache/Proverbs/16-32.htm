In the ancient Near Eastern context, warriors were highly esteemed for their ability to protect and expand territories. However, this proverb elevates the virtue of being "slow to anger," suggesting that inner strength and restraint are more commendable. This aligns with other biblical teachings, such as <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19-20</a>, which advises believers to be "quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry." The comparison to a warrior highlights the cultural admiration for military heroes, yet it redirects that admiration towards those who master their emotions.<p><b>and he who controls his temper is greater than one who captures a city</b><br>In ancient times, capturing a city was a significant military achievement, often involving strategic planning, strength, and leadership. This phrase suggests that the ability to control one's temper is an even greater accomplishment. The historical context of city conquests, such as those seen in the narratives of Joshua or David, underscores the magnitude of this comparison. The proverb implies that true leadership and greatness come from self-mastery rather than external conquests. This idea is echoed in the New Testament, where the fruit of the Spirit includes self-control (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The emphasis on internal victory over external success points to a deeper spiritual truth, aligning with the teachings of Jesus, who often highlighted the importance of the heart's condition over outward appearances or achievements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
