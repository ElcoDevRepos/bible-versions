This approach is consistent with the broader context of Proverbs, which frequently uses familial language to convey moral and ethical teachings.<p><b>if you have put up security for your neighbor,</b><br>In ancient times, putting up security meant guaranteeing someone else's debt or obligation. This was a serious commitment, as it could lead to financial ruin if the neighbor defaulted. The Bible often warns against such practices (<a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15, 17</a>:18, 22:26-27) because they can lead to entanglement in another's financial troubles. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and the importance of managing one's resources wisely.<p><b>if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger,</b><br>Striking hands was a customary way to seal an agreement or contract, similar to a handshake today. In the ancient Near East, this act symbolized a binding commitment. The mention of a "stranger" highlights the risk involved, as it implies entering into an agreement with someone outside one's immediate community or family, where trust and accountability might be less assured. This phrase underscores the biblical caution against hasty or unwise commitments, especially with those who are not well-known or trusted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_son.htm">My Son</a></b><br>This phrase is often used in Proverbs to address the reader in a personal and intimate manner, suggesting a fatherly advice or wisdom being imparted.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>In the context of ancient Israel, a neighbor would be someone within the community or tribe, emphasizing the close-knit relationships and mutual responsibilities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/stranger.htm">Stranger</a></b><br>This term refers to someone outside of one's immediate community or family, highlighting the potential risks involved in financial dealings with those who are not well-known.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/security/pledge.htm">Security/Pledge</a></b><br>This refers to the act of guaranteeing another person's debt or obligation, a common practice in ancient times that could lead to significant personal risk.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/struck_hands.htm">Struck Hands</a></b><br>This is an ancient gesture similar to a handshake, symbolizing an agreement or contract, often used in the context of financial or legal commitments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_financial_commitments.htm">Wisdom in Financial Commitments</a></b><br>The verse teaches the importance of exercising wisdom and caution in financial dealings, especially when it involves guaranteeing another's debt.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_risks.htm">Understanding Risks</a></b><br>It highlights the potential risks and consequences of entering into financial agreements without fully understanding the implications.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_responsibility.htm">Community and Responsibility</a></b><br>The mention of "neighbor" and "stranger" underscores the importance of knowing whom you are dealing with and the responsibilities that come with community relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/biblical_principles_of_stewardship.htm">Biblical Principles of Stewardship</a></b><br>This passage encourages believers to apply biblical principles of stewardship, ensuring that their financial decisions honor God and protect their resources.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_6_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 6:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_verbal_traps_today.htm">How can we avoid becoming "ensnared by the words of your mouth" today?

The only occasion for loans would be to supply the immediate necessities of the borrower, and the exaction of interest under such circumstances would be productive of great hardship, involving the loss of land and even personal freedom, as the insolvent debtor and his family became the slaves of the creditor (<a href="/context/nehemiah/5-1.htm" title="And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.">Nehemiah 5:1-5</a>). To prevent these evils, the lending of money on interest to any poor Israelite was strictly forbidden (<a href="/context/leviticus/25-35.htm" title="And if your brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you; then you shall relieve him: yes, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you.">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>); the people were enjoined to be liberal, and lend for nothing in such cases. But at the time of Solomon, when the commerce of the Israelites had enormously developed, and communications were opened with Spain and Egypt and (possibly) with India and Ceylon, while caravans penetrated beyond the Euphrates, then the lending of money on interest for employment in trade most probably became frequent, and suretyship also, the pledging of a man's own credit to enable his friend to procure a loan. And when the wealth that accompanied this development of the national resources had brought luxury in its train, borrowing and suretyship would be employed for less worthy purposes, to supply the young nobles of Jerusalem with money for their extravagance.
