In ancient Near Eastern culture, dogs were not the beloved pets they are today; they were often seen as unclean scavengers. This imagery is used to illustrate the repulsive nature of returning to one's sinful or foolish ways. The act of a dog returning to its vomit is a natural, albeit disgusting, behavior, symbolizing the natural inclination of a fool to revert to their previous mistakes. This concept is echoed in <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>, where the apostle Peter uses the same imagery to describe false teachers who return to their corrupt ways after knowing the truth. The repetition of folly is likened to a natural, albeit undesirable, instinct.<p><b>so a fool repeats his folly</b><br>The term "fool" in the biblical context often refers to someone who is morally deficient, lacking wisdom and understanding of God's ways. The repetition of folly indicates a cycle of behavior that is difficult to break without divine intervention. This reflects the biblical theme of human depravity and the need for repentance and transformation through God's wisdom. Proverbs frequently contrasts the wise and the foolish, emphasizing that wisdom leads to life and folly to destruction. The fool's inability to learn from past mistakes is a warning to seek wisdom and understanding, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, which states that "the fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge." This phrase serves as a call to self-examination and the pursuit of wisdom to avoid the destructive cycle of folly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The fool never frees himself from the trammels of his foolishness; his deeds and words always bear the same character to the end. The same truth holds good of the sinner, especially the drunkard and the sensualist. If they feel temporary compunction, and reject their sin by partial repentance, they do not really shake it off wholly; it has become a second nature to them, and they soon relapse into it. Septuagint, "As when a dog goes to his own vomit and becomes hateful, so is a fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin." The LXX. adds a distich which is found in Ecclus. 4:21, "There is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that is glory and grace." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/26-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As a dog</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1499;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;e&#183;le&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3611.htm">Strong's 3611: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dog, a male prostitute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">returns</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">its vomit,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1461;&#1488;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6892.htm">Strong's 6892: </a> </span><span class="str2">What is vomited up, vomit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">so a fool</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1437;&#1505;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;s&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">repeats</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;w&#183;neh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8138.htm">Strong's 8138: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fold, duplicate, to transmute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his folly.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;iw&#183;wal&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_200.htm">Strong's 200: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silliness</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 26:11 As a dog that returns to his (Prov.
