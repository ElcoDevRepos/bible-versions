In biblical times, as today, the spoken word held significant power. Proverbs often contrasts the wise and the foolish, and here, verbosity is linked to folly. The culture of ancient Israel valued wisdom and discernment, often conveyed through concise and thoughtful speech. The emphasis on the quantity of words reflects a broader biblical theme found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>, which advises against hasty speech before God.<p><b>sin is unavoidable,</b><br>The inevitability of sin with excessive talking underscores the human tendency to err, especially when not exercising self-control. <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2-12</a> elaborates on the power of the tongue, describing it as a small part of the body that can cause great harm. The historical context of Proverbs, a book of wisdom literature, often addresses the moral and ethical conduct expected of God's people. The idea that sin is unavoidable with many words serves as a warning to guard one's speech, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of the fallibility of human nature.<p><b>but he who restrains his lips</b><br>Restraint in speech is portrayed as a virtue. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where honor and shame were significant societal values, controlling one's words was a sign of wisdom and maturity. This restraint is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to be "quick to listen, slow to speak" (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>). The ability to hold one's tongue is seen as a mark of self-discipline and spiritual maturity, reflecting the character of those who seek to live righteously.<p><b>is wise.</b><br>Wisdom, a central theme in Proverbs, is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The wise person, in this context, is one who understands the power of words and exercises discretion. This wisdom is not merely intellectual but deeply practical, influencing daily behavior and relationships. The restraint in speech is a reflection of inner wisdom, aligning with the character of Jesus Christ, who exemplified perfect wisdom and self-control in His interactions, often choosing silence over unnecessary words (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The pattern is clear: speech multiplies opportunities for error when it overflows without thought.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sin is unavoidable</b><p>&#8226; Proverbs continues, &#8220;sin is unavoidable,&#8221; underscoring the near-certainty that excessive talk leads to offense, gossip, exaggeration, or anger.<p>&#8226; Jesus affirms the same principle: &#8220;I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>). The careless surplus of words invites divine scrutiny.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a> warns, &#8220;Reckless words pierce like a sword,&#8221; showing how sin often rides on the back of unguarded speech.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he who restrains his lips</b><p>&#8226; The contrast arrives: &#8220;but he who restrains his lips.&#8221; Restraint is an intentional, disciplined act, not mere shyness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a> teaches, &#8220;He who guards his mouth protects his life,&#8221; reinforcing that deliberate silence can be an act of self-preservation.<p>&#8226; This restraint aligns with the fruit of the Spirit&#8212;self-control (<a href="/galatians/5-23.htm">Galatians 5:23</a>)&#8212;and with <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>, which says that mastering the tongue signals maturity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is wise</b><p>&#8226; The proverb closes by labeling restrained speech as wisdom. True wisdom is practical; it aligns knowledge with godly living.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/17-27.htm">Proverbs 17:27</a> affirms, &#8220;A man of knowledge restrains his words,&#8221; while verse 28 adds that even a fool &#8220;is considered wise when he holds his peace.&#8221; The mark of wisdom, then, is not in saying more but in knowing when to say less.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:14</a> notes, &#8220;A fool multiplies words,&#8221; providing the flip side of the same truth: wisdom trims language to fit righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a> draws a straight line from word count to moral risk: the more we speak, the more likely we err.

"Speak little," says Pinart ('Meditations,' ch. 6.), "because for one sin which we may commit by keeping silence where it would be well to speak, we commit a hundred by speaking upon all occasions" (see on Proverbs 17:27), Another rendering of the passage gives "By multitude of words sin does not vanish away;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you cannot mend a fault by much talking.
