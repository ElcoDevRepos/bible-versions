In biblical terms, a "fool" is someone who lacks wisdom and understanding, often ignoring God's commandments and living a life contrary to divine principles. The possession of money by a fool suggests a potential for misuse, as wealth in the hands of someone lacking discernment can lead to destructive outcomes. The Bible often contrasts the wise and the foolish, emphasizing that true wisdom is more valuable than material wealth (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-15</a>). The imagery of money in hand suggests readiness or capability, yet without the necessary wisdom, it is futile.<p><b>with no intention of buying wisdom?</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the fool's lack of desire or intention to acquire wisdom, despite having the means to do so. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wisdom was often sought through instruction and learning, sometimes requiring resources to access teachers or scrolls. The fool's failure to invest in wisdom reflects a deeper spiritual and moral deficiency. Proverbs frequently emphasizes the pursuit of wisdom as a noble and essential endeavor (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>). The rhetorical question implies that the fool's priorities are misplaced, valuing temporary, material possessions over eternal, spiritual growth. This can be seen as a call to prioritize spiritual wealth over material wealth, aligning with Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, where He advises storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, the fool is someone who lacks wisdom and understanding, often characterized by a rejection of God&#8217;s ways and a preference for folly.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>A central theme in Proverbs, wisdom is portrayed as a valuable treasure, often personified as a woman calling out to be embraced.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid prodest stulto habere divitias, cum sapientiam emere non possit</span>? The rabbis in later time were not allowed to take fees for teaching; but it was customary to make offerings to seers and wise men, when their services were engaged or their advice was asked (see the case of Saul and Samuel, <a href="/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7, 8</a>). The last clause gives the reason why it is useless for a fool to try to learn wisdom even at a large expenditure on teachers. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he hath no heart to it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no capability for receiving it; his mental digestion cannot assimilate it. The heart, as we have already noticed, is regarded as the seat of the understanding. Thus the LXX., "Why doth a fool have wealth? for a man without heart cannot acquire wisdom." In the Gospel Christ calls his disciples "fools and slow of heart to believe what the prophets had written, and himself opened their mind (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>), that they might understand the Scriptures" (<a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25, 45</a>).
