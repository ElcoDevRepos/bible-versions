In biblical context, "men of bloodshed" refers to individuals who engage in acts of violence and injustice, often driven by selfish desires or power. The hatred they have for a "blameless man" stems from the contrast between their sinful actions and the righteous life of the blameless. This is reminiscent of the story of Cain and Abel in <a href="/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a>, where Cain's jealousy and sin led him to murder his righteous brother Abel. The blameless man, often seen as a type of Christ, represents purity and innocence, which convicts the wicked of their wrongdoing. This enmity is also seen in the life of Jesus, who was hated by those who opposed His message of truth and righteousness.<p><b>but the upright care for his life</b><br>In contrast to the men of bloodshed, the "upright" are those who live according to God's laws and principles. They value and protect the life of the blameless, recognizing the inherent worth and dignity given by God. This care reflects the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and standing up for justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for acting justly and loving mercy. The upright's concern for the blameless man's life can also be seen as a reflection of God's own care and protection for His people, as illustrated in <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91</a>. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of the righteous standing in solidarity with those who are innocent and vulnerable, much like how Christ, the ultimate blameless one, is cared for by His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_bloodshed.htm">Men of Bloodshed</a></b><br>This term refers to individuals who are violent, wicked, or have malicious intent. In the Hebrew text, the word used is (anshei damim), which literally means "men of blood." These are people who are characterized by their willingness to harm others.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/blameless_man.htm">Blameless Man</a></b><br>This refers to a person who is innocent, righteous, or morally upright. The Hebrew word (tamim) is used, meaning complete, whole, or without blemish. This person lives in a way that is pleasing to God and is often the target of the wicked.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upright.htm">The Upright</a></b><br>These are individuals who live according to God's standards and seek to do what is right. The Hebrew word (yashar) is used, meaning straight, right, or level. They are contrasted with the men of bloodshed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_persecution.htm">The Reality of Persecution</a></b><br>The verse highlights the reality that those who live righteously will often face opposition from those who are wicked.

Scripture consistently portrays them as:<p>&#8226; Shedding innocent blood (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Filling the earth with corruption (<a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Trusting in force, not God (<a href="/psalms/11-5.htm">Psalm 11:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>).<p>The phrase reminds us that violence is not merely an outward act; it springs from a heart resistant to God&#8217;s rule (<a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hate a blameless man</b><p>The proverb continues: &#8220;Men of bloodshed hate a blameless man.&#8221; Hatred here is visceral hostility toward someone innocent of wrongdoing. Why?<p>&#8226; A blameless life exposes the sin of the violent, much like Abel&#8217;s faith angered Cain (<a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Light threatens darkness (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>); wicked hearts recoil from righteousness.<p>&#8226; The godly remind evildoers of coming judgment (<a href="/proverbs/29-27.htm">Proverbs 29:27</a>).<p>Notice that the blameless person is not faultless in a sinless sense, but upright in conduct and motives (<a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>). Such integrity irritates those determined to live without moral restraint.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The upright care for his life</b><p>In sharp contrast, &#8220;the upright care for his life.&#8221; Genuine righteousness is never passive; it actively protects the innocent. Examples throughout Scripture include:<p>&#8226; Jonathan shielding David from Saul&#8217;s murderous rage (<a href="/1_samuel/19-1.htm">1 Samuel 19:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The midwives preserving Hebrew infants despite Pharaoh&#8217;s command (<a href="/exodus/1-17.htm">Exodus 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The Good Samaritan tending the wounded traveler (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a>).<p>The upright &#8220;care&#8221; by:<p>1. Valuing life as God&#8217;s gift (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>).<p>2. Intervening when the blameless are threatened (<a href="/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11-12</a>).<p>3. Speaking truth that restrains bloodshed (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>; <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>Thus the proverb underscores a community ethic: violence despises innocence, but righteousness defends it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/29-10.htm">Proverbs 29:10</a> sets two opposing groups in stark relief. Violent people, driven by rebellion, loathe the presence of a person whose life is clean before God. Upright people, governed by God&#8217;s wisdom, feel compelled to safeguard that same blameless life. The verse calls us to reject any trace of violence in our own hearts and to stand actively on the side of the innocent, imitating the Lord who &#8220;rescues the life of the needy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/72-13.htm">Psalm 72:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">The bloodthirsty hate the upright.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">perfect man.

His life is a tacit reproach to men of blood, robbers, murderers, and such like sinners, as is finely expressed in the Book of Wisdom 2:12, etc. (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the just seek his soul.</span> The explanation of this hemistich is doubtful. The following interpretations have been offered: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The just seek the soul of the upright to deliver him from death temporal and spiritual (comp. <a href="/proverbs/12-6.htm">Proverbs 12:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The just seek the murderer's life, take vengeance on him (comp. <a href="/psalms/63-9.htm">Psalm 63:9, 10</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "As for the just, they (the murderers) attempt his life," where the change of subject, though by no means unparalleled, is awkward (comp. <a href="/psalms/37-14.htm">Psalm 37:14</a>). The second explanation makes the righteous the executioners of vengeance on the delinquents, which does not seem to be the idea intended, and there is no confirmation of it in our book. The interpretation first given has against it the fact that the phrase, "to seek the soul," is used of attempts against the life, not of preserving it. But this is not fatal; and the above seems to be the most likely explanation offered, and gives a good antithesis. Men of blood hate a virtuous man, and try to destroy him; the righteous love him, and do their utmost to defend and keep him safe. If this interpretation is rejected, the third explanation is allowable, the <span class="accented">casus pendens</span> - "the just, they seek his life" - may be compared with <a href="/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>.
