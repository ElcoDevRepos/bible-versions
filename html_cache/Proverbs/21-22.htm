In ancient times, cities were often fortified with walls and guarded by mighty warriors. The imagery of scaling a city suggests strategic thinking and insight, rather than direct confrontation. Wisdom is portrayed as a tool that can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. This echoes the biblical theme that God&#8217;s wisdom surpasses human strength, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>, where the wisdom of God is described as greater than human wisdom and strength.<p><b>and pulls down the stronghold</b><br>Strongholds were fortified places of defense, often used metaphorically in Scripture to represent places of false security or spiritual bondage. The wise man's ability to pull down these strongholds suggests that wisdom can dismantle false beliefs and ideologies. This is reminiscent of <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a>, where Paul speaks of demolishing arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God. The wise man&#8217;s actions symbolize the triumph of divine wisdom over human arrogance and self-reliance.<p><b>in which they trust</b><br>The phrase underscores the misplaced trust of the mighty in their physical defenses and strength. It serves as a caution against relying on worldly power and security, which can be easily overturned by wisdom. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, where trust in chariots and horses is contrasted with trust in the name of the Lord. The wise man&#8217;s victory illustrates the futility of trusting in anything other than God, pointing to the ultimate security found in divine wisdom and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_man.htm">Wise Man</a></b><br>Represents a person who possesses godly wisdom, discernment, and understanding.
