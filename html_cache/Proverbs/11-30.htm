In Proverbs, the "fruit of the righteous" suggests the outcomes or results of a life lived in accordance with God's will. This fruit is not only beneficial to the individual but also to those around them, much like a tree that provides sustenance and shelter. The righteous, through their actions and character, offer life-giving wisdom and guidance to others, reflecting the life-giving nature of Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate fulfillment of the tree of life (<a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>). The righteous are those who live by faith, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a> and reiterated in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>, and their lives bear witness to God's transformative power.<p><b>and he who wins souls is wise</b><br>Winning souls refers to the act of leading others to a knowledge of God and a relationship with Him. This phrase emphasizes the value of evangelism and discipleship, which are central to the Great Commission given by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>. The wisdom in winning souls lies in understanding the eternal significance of salvation and the joy it brings in heaven, as noted in <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>. The wise person recognizes the importance of spiritual matters over temporal concerns, aligning with the teachings of Jesus, who prioritized the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). This wisdom is not merely intellectual but is deeply spiritual, reflecting the heart of God who desires all to be saved (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). The act of winning souls is a reflection of Christ's mission on earth, as He came to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>), and those who engage in this work are participating in the divine purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, the righteous are those who live according to God's laws and principles, embodying wisdom and moral integrity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tree_of_life.htm">Tree of Life</a></b><br>A symbol of eternal life and divine blessing, first mentioned in the Garden of Eden, representing the sustenance and flourishing that comes from living a righteous life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_soul-winner.htm">Wise Soul-Winner</a></b><br>This refers to individuals who, through their wisdom and righteous living, lead others to righteousness and a relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_righteous_living.htm">The Impact of Righteous Living</a></b><br>Righteousness produces life-giving fruit, much like a tree that provides sustenance and shelter.

Fruit is the natural, visible outcome of a healthy tree, and Scripture often uses the picture to describe a believer&#8217;s outward life. Jesus said, &#8220;By their fruit you will recognize them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16</a>). Paul listed &#8220;love, joy, peace&#8230;&#8221; as the &#8220;fruit of the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Fruit is produced, not manufactured; it emerges as we abide in Christ (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; It is meant to be tasted by others&#8212;evidence that God is at work within.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the righteous</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;&#8230;of the righteous&#8230;.&#8221; Righteousness here points to those who are right with God and walk in His ways. &#8220;The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>), and &#8220;he will be like a tree planted by streams of water&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Righteous standing begins with faith (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>) and shows itself in righteous living (<a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; When such people act, speak, and serve, their fruit bears God&#8217;s unmistakable imprint.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is a tree of life</b><p>&#8220;The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life&#8230;.&#8221; This phrase reaches back to Eden: &#8220;In the middle of the garden were the tree of life&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>).

That which the righteous say and do is, as it were, a fruitful tree which delights and feeds many. A good man's example and teaching promote spiritual health and lead to immortal life. Septuagint, "From the fruit of righteousness springeth a tree of life." <span class="cmt_word">And he that winneth souls is wise;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he that is wise winneth souls.</span> The latter member is parallel to the former. He who gives men of the tree of life attracts souls to himself, to listen to his teaching and to follow his example. With this "winning of souls" we may compare Christ's promise to the apostles that they should "catch men" (<a href="/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>; comp. <a href="/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>). The Septuagint introduces an antithesis not found in our Hebrew text: "But the souls of transgressors are taken untimely away." Ewald and others change the present order of clauses in vers. 29 and 30, thinking thus to improve the parallelism. They would rearrange the passage in the following way: "He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; but the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart; but he that is wise winneth souls." There is no authority whatever in the versions or older commentators for this alteration; and the existing arrangement, as we have shown, gives a very good sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/11-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The fruit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1469;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;r&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6529.htm">Strong's 6529: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fruit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the righteous</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1453;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ad&#183;d&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6662.htm">Strong's 6662: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just, righteous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a tree</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6086.htm">Strong's 6086: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tree, trees, wood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of life,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and he who wins</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1511;&#1461;&#1430;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;q&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">souls</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5315.htm">Strong's 5315: </a> </span><span class="str2">A soul, living being, life, self, person, desire, passion, appetite, emotion </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[is] wise.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2450.htm">Strong's 2450: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wise</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/11-30.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 11:30 The fruit of the righteous (Prov.
