This phrase suggests a proactive and organized effort to reach others, symbolizing wisdom's active pursuit of those who need guidance. The use of maidservants indicates a structured and intentional approach, emphasizing the importance and urgency of the message being delivered. This can be seen as a type of the Great Commission, where believers are sent out to share the gospel. The imagery of sending out messengers is also reminiscent of Jesus sending out His disciples to spread His teachings.<p><b>she calls out from the heights of the city.</b><br>The "heights of the city" refers to a place of visibility and prominence, ensuring that the call is heard by as many people as possible. In ancient cities, the heights or high places were often associated with places of worship or significant public announcements. This setting underscores the importance and public nature of wisdom's invitation. The call from a high place signifies authority and the desire for the message to reach all inhabitants, much like the proclamations of prophets in the Old Testament who often spoke from elevated positions to address the people. This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's Sermon on the Mount, where He taught from a high place to reach the multitudes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>Personified as a woman who is proactive in inviting others to learn and gain understanding.

Before anyone seeks her, she dispatches &#8220;maidservants&#8221; to extend the invitation&#8212;just as the king in Jesus&#8217; parable &#8220;sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the banquet&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/22-3.htm">Matthew 22:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The messengers highlight God&#8217;s chosen means of reaching people: human agents. Paul affirms, &#8220;We are therefore ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His appeal through us&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Their plural form suggests that the call is many-voiced&#8212;prophets, pastors, parents, friends&#8212;all echoing the same gospel invitation.<p>&#8226; This sending mirrors the Great Commission, &#8220;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). Wisdom&#8217;s feast is meant for every listener, not an exclusive few.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She calls out</b><p>&#8226; After commissioning her servants, Wisdom herself raises her own voice. Divine truth is never delegated to others alone; the Lord personally appeals to hearts.<p>&#8226; The cry is urgent and audible. <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-21</a> states, &#8220;Wisdom calls out in the street&#8230; she raises her voice in the public square&#8221;, showing continuity in her message.<p>&#8226; The call is gracious: &#8220;Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>). It is also commanding: &#8220;Turn in here&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a>). Grace and authority stand side by side.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a> points forward to the final echo: &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say, &#8216;Come!&#8217;&#8221;.

By them are represented the apostles and preachers and ministers, who go forth to win souls for Christ.
