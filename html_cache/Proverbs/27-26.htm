The wool from lambs was a primary source of clothing, highlighting the importance of shepherding in biblical times. This phrase underscores the provision and sustenance that come from diligent care of one's flock. Biblically, lambs often symbolize innocence and sacrifice, as seen in the Passover lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-11</a>) and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The imagery of lambs providing clothing can also be seen as a metaphor for how God clothes His people with righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>and the goats with the price of a field</b><br>Goats were another essential livestock in the biblical era, valued for their milk, meat, and hides. The mention of goats providing the price of a field indicates their economic value and the potential for trade and investment. In the cultural context, owning land was a sign of wealth and stability, and goats could be a means to acquire such assets. This phrase reflects the principle of wise stewardship and the importance of using resources to secure one's future. In a broader biblical context, fields often symbolize the mission field or the world (<a href="/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>), suggesting that the resources God provides should be used to further His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
