Streets in ancient Israel were central to daily life, serving as places of commerce, social interaction, and travel. The mention of the street suggests a setting where the woman is visible and active, indicating her boldness and lack of shame. Biblically, streets often symbolize the world and its temptations, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-21</a>, where wisdom also calls out in the streets, contrasting the seductive call of folly.<p><b>Now in the squares</b><br>Squares were open areas in ancient cities where people gathered for various activities, including markets, public meetings, and social gatherings. The use of "squares" emphasizes the woman's strategic choice of location to maximize her influence and reach. This setting reflects the cultural context of the time, where public spaces were integral to community life. The squares are symbolic of places where decisions are made, paralleling the choice between wisdom and folly presented throughout Proverbs.<p><b>She lurks at every corner</b><br>The imagery of lurking suggests stealth and deceit, indicating the woman's intent to ensnare the unsuspecting. Corners in ancient cities were often places where paths intersected, making them ideal for encounters. This phrase underscores the pervasive nature of temptation, as it can be encountered unexpectedly. The concept of lurking is reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>, where sin is described as crouching at the door, ready to pounce. This highlights the ever-present danger of moral failure and the need for vigilance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seductress.htm">The Seductress</a></b><br>The primary figure in this passage is the "seductress" or "adulteress," representing temptation and sin.

He chose distance over dialogue.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a> reminds us that temptation&#8217;s approach is relentless; yielding begins when desire is allowed to linger in the &#8220;square&#8221; of our thoughts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she lurks at every corner</b><p>The language shifts from visibility to stealth&#8212;she &#8220;lurks.&#8221; What was open is now ambush.<p>&#8226; Corners suggest decision points.
