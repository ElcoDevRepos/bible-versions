In biblical times, wisdom was highly esteemed, and the ability to remain silent was often associated with understanding and maturity. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on speech, as words were seen as powerful and influential. This proverb suggests that even those lacking wisdom can appear wise by choosing silence over foolish speech. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>, which advises believers to be "quick to listen, slow to speak." The idea of silence as a virtue is also seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who often chose silence in the face of accusations (<a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>).<p><b>and discerning when he holds his tongue</b><br>Discernment is the ability to judge well, and this phrase implies that restraint in speech is a sign of discernment. In the historical context of the Bible, discernment was a key attribute of leaders and prophets, who were expected to speak wisely and at the right time. The connection to other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>, which states, "When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise," reinforces the idea that careful speech is a mark of wisdom. This principle is also seen in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of words and their impact (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>). The ability to hold one's tongue is a reflection of inner strength and self-control, qualities that are esteemed throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Scripture never flatters such a person, yet here even this unlikely candidate is given an unexpected opportunity.

Cato, 'Dist.,' 1:3 - <p><span class="foreign">"Virtutem primam esse puta compescere linguam;<br />Proximus ille Deo qui scit ratione tacere."</span> Talmud, "Silence becomes the wise, much more feels." The Dutch have appropriated this maxim, "Zweigen de dwazen zij waren wijs, .... Were fools silent, they would pass for wise." "Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses." "Silence," says the Sanskrit gnome, "is the ornament of the ignorant." "Talking comes by nature," say the Germans, "silence of understanding." The LXX. gives a different turn to the first clause: "A foolish man inquiring of wisdom will have wisdom imputed to him;" the expressed desire of knowledge will be taken as a proof of intelligence. The second clause is coordinate with the former. <span class="cmt_word">He that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">when he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent</span>; Septuagint, "A man making himself dumb will seem to be prudent." Theophrastus is said to have thus addressed a guest who was very silent at table: "If you are a fool, you act wisely; if you are wise, you act foolishly." "Let every man," says St. James (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>), "be swift to hear, slow to speak." <p>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/17-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(gam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a fool</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1493;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;w&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">Foolish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is considered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2803.htm">Strong's 2803: </a> </span><span class="str2">To think, account</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2450.htm">Strong's 2450: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if he keeps silent,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1453;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2790.htm">Strong's 2790: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut in, engrave, plow, devise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] discerning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_995.htm">Strong's 995: </a> </span><span class="str2">To separate mentally, understand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when he holds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1496;&#1461;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7789;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_331.htm">Strong's 331: </a> </span><span class="str2">To close, to contract</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his tongue.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8193.htm">Strong's 8193: </a> </span><span class="str2">The lip, language, a margin</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/17-28.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 17:28 Even a fool when he keeps silent (Prov.
