In biblical times, labor was often physically demanding, and sustenance was a primary concern. The concept of appetite here can be seen as a metaphor for the drive and motivation that compels individuals to work diligently. This aligns with the broader biblical principle that diligence and hard work are virtuous (<a href="/proverbs/12-24.htm">Proverbs 12:24</a>). The idea that one's needs can motivate productivity is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul writes about working to provide for oneself and others (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10-12</a>).<p><b>because his hunger drives him onward.</b><br>Hunger, both literal and metaphorical, is a powerful motivator. In the ancient Near Eastern context, where food scarcity was a real threat, hunger would indeed drive a person to labor. This reflects the broader biblical theme of reliance on God for provision, as seen in the Israelites' dependence on manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16). Theologically, this can also be seen as a type of spiritual hunger that drives believers to seek God and His righteousness (<a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>). The drive to satisfy hunger can be paralleled with the spiritual pursuit of fulfilling one's purpose in God's plan, emphasizing perseverance and reliance on divine provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Hunger is not pictured as an enemy but as a purposeful reminder that we need provision. In <a href="/proverbs/13-25.htm">Proverbs 13:25</a>, &#8220;The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite,&#8221; we see that God intends our cravings to be met legitimately. The verse assumes honest labor rather than covetous shortcuts (compare <a href="/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11</a>, &#8220;He who works his land will have plenty of bread&#8221;). Appetite here signals a God-given motivation, nudging the worker toward diligence instead of idleness (<a href="/proverbs/19-15.htm">Proverbs 19:15</a> warns, &#8220;Laziness brings on deep sleep, and an idle soul will suffer hunger&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>works for him</b><p>The phrase shifts focus: appetite is portrayed as a servant, actually producing benefit. What looks like mere physical desire turns out to be a tool that &#8220;works for him.&#8221; Paul echoes this dynamic in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10&#8211;12</a>, commanding believers to earn their own bread, not rely on others. Hunger becomes an internal coach, prompting wise industry. Likewise, <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a> observes, &#8220;There is profit in all hard work, but mere talk leads only to poverty.&#8221; The principle is simple: need harnessed to effort yields provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because his hunger</b><p>The verse drills down to the cause: hunger itself. God often uses natural consequences rather than constant miraculous intervention. When the prodigal son &#8220;began to be in need&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-14.htm">Luke 15:14</a>), that physical hunger turned his heart toward home and restoration. In the wilderness, Israel&#8217;s hunger tested whether they would trust God for manna (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3&#8211;4</a>). Physical emptiness can expose spiritual emptiness, steering us toward both practical labor and deeper reliance on the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>drives him onward</b><p>Hunger is portrayed as a driver, not a fence. It propels the worker forward, keeping lethargy at bay. <a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a> notes, &#8220;Idle hands make one poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.&#8221; Hunger&#8217;s push is meant to result in perseverance rather than despair. Even Jesus, after fasting forty days, confronted temptation with Scripture and then was ministered to by angels (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2, 11</a>). Hunger did not derail His mission; it underscored dependence on the Father. For us, the verse encourages steady forward motion&#8212;using felt need as fuel for God-honoring diligence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a> teaches that God weaves physical appetite into His design for industrious, responsible living. The honest worker&#8217;s growling stomach isn&#8217;t a curse; it&#8217;s a God-given engine that puts hands to work, wards off laziness, and ultimately leads to provision. When we respond to need with faithful effort and reliance on the Lord, hunger becomes a helper, driving us onward in both daily labor and spiritual growth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">He that laboureth laboureth for himself.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">the desire, </span>or <span class= "ital">hunger, of the labourer laboureth for him, for his mouth urges him on; </span>the feeling that he is supplying his own needs gives him strength for his work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that laboureth laboureth for himself;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the soul of him that laboureth laboureth for him.</span> "Soul" here is equivalent to "desire," "appetite" (comp. <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>), and the maxim signifies that hunger is a strong incentive to work - the needs of the body spur the labourer to diligence and assiduity; he eats bread in the sweat of his brow (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). Says the Latin gnome - <p><span class="foreign">"Largitor artium, ingeniique magister Venter."</span> <p><span class="accented">"The belly is the teacher of all arts,<br />The parent of invention."</span> De tout s'avise a qui pain faut, "He who wants bread thinks of everything." There is our own homely saw, "Need makes the old wife trot;" as the Italians say, "Hunger sets the dog a-hunting" (Kelly). <span class="cmt_word">For his mouth craveth it of him;</span> his mouth must have food to put in it. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">akaph</span>) does not occur elsewhere; it means properly "to bend," and then to put a load on, to constrain to press. So here, "His mouth bends over him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> urgeth him thereto" (Revised Version). <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7</a>, "All labour of man is for his mouth;" we should say stomach. Hunger in some sense is the great stimulus of all work. "We commanded you," says St. Paul (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>), "that if any would not work, neither should he eat." There is a spiritual hunger without which grace cannot be sought or obtained - that hungering and thirsting after righteousness of which Christ speaks, and which he who is the Bread of life is ready to satisfy (<a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>; <a href="/john/6-58.htm">John 6:58</a>).
