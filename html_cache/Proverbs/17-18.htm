In the biblical context, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The lack of judgment here implies a deficiency in understanding and prudence, which are highly valued in the wisdom literature of the Bible. The Hebrew culture placed a strong emphasis on wisdom as a guiding principle for life, as seen throughout the Book of Proverbs.<p><b>strikes hands in pledge</b><br>The act of striking hands was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, symbolizing an agreement or contract. It is akin to a modern-day handshake or signing of a contract. In the context of Proverbs, this action is often viewed negatively when done without careful consideration, as it can lead to financial or relational entanglements. The Bible warns against rash commitments, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6.htm">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>, where the consequences of such actions are discussed.<p><b>and puts up security for his neighbor</b><br>Offering security for another person&#8217;s debt was a risky financial decision in ancient times, as it could lead to personal loss if the debtor defaulted. The cultural and historical context shows that such practices were common, but the wisdom literature advises caution. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of stewardship and responsibility, emphasizing the need to manage one's resources wisely. The New Testament echoes this sentiment in passages like <a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8</a>, which advises believers to owe nothing to anyone except love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_lacking_judgment.htm">The Man Lacking Judgment</a></b><br>This individual is characterized by a lack of discernment or wisdom, often making impulsive or unwise decisions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>In the context of ancient Israel, a neighbor would be someone within the community or close social circle, emphasizing the relational aspect of the pledge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pledge.htm">Pledge</a></b><br>This refers to a financial or legal commitment, often involving a handshake or agreement to guarantee another person's debt or obligation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_financial_matters.htm">Discernment in Financial Matters</a></b><br>Christians are encouraged to exercise wisdom and discernment in financial dealings, avoiding impulsive commitments that could lead to personal or familial hardship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prudence.htm">The Importance of Prudence</a></b><br>Prudence is a virtue that involves careful consideration of potential consequences before making decisions, especially those involving financial or legal obligations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_responsibility.htm">Community and Responsibility</a></b><br>While helping others is a Christian virtue, it is important to balance generosity with responsibility, ensuring that one's own household is not put at risk.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/biblical_wisdom_on_debt.htm">Biblical Wisdom on Debt</a></b><br>The Bible consistently advises caution regarding debt and financial entanglements, encouraging believers to live within their means and avoid unnecessary liabilities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_17_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 17:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_17_18_on_impulsive_finances.htm">How does Proverbs 17:18 warn against impulsive financial decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_pledging_unwise_in_Proverbs_17_18.htm">Why is "striking hands in pledge" considered unwise in Proverbs 17:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_17_18_Choosing_true_friends.htm">How can Proverbs 17:18 guide us in choosing trustworthy friends?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_Proverbs_on_debt_guarantees.htm">What other Proverbs caution against guaranteeing another's debt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_17_18_s_modern_financial_lesson.htm">How can we apply Proverbs 17:18 to modern financial practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_17_18_on_financial_wisdom.htm">What does Proverbs 17:18 teach about financial responsibility and wisdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_17_18_and_trust_in_bonds.htm">How does Proverbs 17:18 relate to the concept of trust in relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Proverbs_17_18_on_debt.htm">Why is Proverbs 17:18 significant in understanding biblical views on debt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_proverbs_17.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Proverbs 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/should_christians_cosign_loans.htm">Is it appropriate for Christians to cosign loans?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_allow_war_killing_but_forbid_murder.htm">Why does the Bible allow killing in war but forbid murder in the Ten Commandments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_handling_debt.htm">What does the Bible say about handling debt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_do_secretive_hand_actions_mean.htm">What does secretive action between hands signify?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Proverbs 17:18 Mean</div><b>A man lacking judgment</b><p>&#8226; The verse opens by labeling the person &#8220;lacking judgment.&#8221; Scripture consistently portrays wisdom as aligning oneself with God&#8217;s revealed truth (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Refusing that wisdom is more than a poor choice&#8212;it is moral folly.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a> reminds us, &#8220;The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,&#8221; underscoring that this lack of judgment is self-deception, not merely limited intelligence.<p>&#8226; In contrast, &#8220;The prudent see danger and take refuge&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a>), showing that true insight recognizes potential trouble and avoids it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Strikes hands in pledge</b><p>&#8226; In ancient practice, striking hands sealed a financial deal. It is equivalent to today&#8217;s handshake on a loan contract.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1-2</a> warns, &#8220;If you have put up security for your neighbor&#8230; you have been trapped by the words of your mouth.&#8221; The same imagery appears in <a href="/proverbs/22-26.htm">Proverbs 22:26</a>, &#8220;Do not be one who shakes hands in pledge.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The issue is not generosity but reckless promise-making. Wisdom invites thoughtful planning (<a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28</a>), whereas impulsive commitments reveal the &#8220;lack of judgment&#8221; just mentioned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Puts up security for his neighbor</b><p>&#8226; Standing surety means guaranteeing someone else&#8217;s debt. If the borrower defaults, the guarantor must pay. <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a> states bluntly, &#8220;He who is a guarantor for a stranger will surely suffer.&#8221;<p>&#8226; While Scripture calls believers to kindness (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>) and sacrificial love (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>), it never endorses foolish financial entanglements that jeopardize one&#8217;s household (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Helping others should follow wise stewardship. Jesus praises lending without expecting return (<a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>), yet He also teaches accountability, as in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). Wise love blends compassion with discernment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Practical wisdom for today</b><p>&#8226; Before co-signing or guaranteeing a loan, prayerfully evaluate:<p>&#8211; Can I bear the full debt without harming my family or gospel priorities?<p>&#8211; Will this enable irresponsibility rather than true need?<p>&#8226; Alternatives often exist: offering advice, budgeting help, or a smaller, no-strings gift (<a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8</a> urges, &#8220;Owe no one anything, except to love each other.&#8221; Love expressed through prudence safeguards both giver and receiver from the strain of unpaid obligations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/17-18.htm">Proverbs 17:18</a> teaches that unthinking financial guarantees reveal a deficit of godly wisdom.
