A large population indicated prosperity, stability, and the ability to defend against enemies. This concept is reflected in the reigns of kings like Solomon, whose wisdom and leadership attracted many to his kingdom, making it a center of wealth and influence (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20-21</a>). The idea of a populous nation as a sign of divine blessing is also seen in the promises made to Abraham, where his descendants were to be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of community and collective strength in achieving a ruler's success and legacy.<p><b>but a lack of subjects is a prince&#8217;s ruin</b><br>The absence of subjects signifies a lack of support, resources, and power, leading to a ruler's downfall. Historically, a prince or king without a following would struggle to maintain authority and face vulnerability to external threats. This principle is evident in the biblical narrative of Rehoboam, Solomon's son, whose harsh policies led to the division of the kingdom and the loss of ten tribes (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16-19</a>). Theologically, this phrase can be seen as a warning against pride and self-reliance, emphasizing the need for wise and compassionate leadership that fosters loyalty and unity. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of the consequences of failing to heed wise counsel and the importance of servant leadership, as exemplified by Jesus Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king.htm">King</a></b><br>Represents leadership and authority.

Increase of population is not, as some political economists would teach, in itself an evil; it is rather a sign of prosperity, and is in agreement with the primeval blessing, "Increase and multiply;" and though it may be hard to maintain the exact equilibrium between production and consumers, yet wise legislation can foresee and remedy the difficulty, the abundance in one part can supply the scarcity in another, the providence of God watching over all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/14-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A large</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#7687;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7230.htm">Strong's 7230: </a> </span><span class="str2">Multitude, abundance, greatness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">population</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a king&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1425;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">splendor,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7695;&#183;ra&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1927.htm">Strong's 1927: </a> </span><span class="str2">Adornment, glory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but a lack</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1445;&#1508;&#1462;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;p&#772;es)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_657.htm">Strong's 657: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cessation, an end, no further, the ankle, foot</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of subjects</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1437;&#1488;&#1465;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3816.htm">Strong's 3816: </a> </span><span class="str2">A community</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a prince&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1494;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;z&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7333.htm">Strong's 7333: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dignitary</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ruin.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7717;it&#183;ta&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4288.htm">Strong's 4288: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dissolution, a ruin, consternation</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/14-28.htm">Proverbs 14:28 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/14-28.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 14:28 In the multitude of people (Prov.
