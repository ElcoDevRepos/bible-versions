Rising early was a common practice in ancient times, especially in agrarian societies where work began at dawn. This reflects her commitment and dedication to her family, mirroring the <a href="/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a> woman's overall character. Biblically, rising early is often associated with seeking God and preparing for the day (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>, <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>). It signifies readiness and a proactive approach to responsibilities.<p><b>to provide food for her household</b><br>In the historical context, providing food was a crucial task, often involving grinding grain, baking bread, and preparing meals from scratch. This phrase underscores her role as a provider and caretaker, ensuring her family's needs are met. It also reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and care for one's family (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>). The act of providing food can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides spiritual nourishment to His followers (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>and portions for her maidservants</b><br>This indicates her leadership and management skills, as she not only cares for her family but also for those who work for her. In ancient households, maidservants were common, and their well-being was a reflection of the household's prosperity and the mistress's character. This phrase highlights her fairness and generosity, aligning with biblical teachings on treating others with kindness and justice (<a href="/colossians/4.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>). It also suggests a harmonious household where everyone is valued and cared for, reflecting the unity and love that should characterize Christian communities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virtuous_woman.htm">The Virtuous Woman</a></b><br>The central figure in <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, often referred to as the "Proverbs 31 Woman," is an idealized representation of a godly and industrious woman.

A lamp is always kept burning at night in Eastern houses, and as it is of very small dimensions, the careful housewife has to rise at midnight to replenish the oil, and she often then begins her household work by grinding the corn or preparing something for next day's meals (comp. ver. 18). Early rising before any great undertaking is continually mentioned in Scripture (see <a href="/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-8.htm">Psalm 57:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4</a>, etc.; <a href="/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>; <a href="/john/20-1.htm">John 20:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And giveth meat to her household;</span> <span class="accented">deditquae praedam domesticis suis</span>, Vulgate. The word for "meat" is <span class="accented">tereph</span>, which means "food torn in pieces" with the teeth (<a href="/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>), and hence food to be eaten. The wife thus early prepares or distributes the food which will be wanted for the day. <span class="cmt_word">And a portion to her maidens.</span> <span class="accented">Chok</span>, "final portion," may apply either to work or food. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">cibaria</span>, "meat;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>, "tasks." The former, which is in accordance with <a href="/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8</a>, would be merely a repetition of the second clause, the meat mentioned there being here called the allotted portion, and would be simply tautological. If we take it in the sense of "appointed labour," we get a new idea, very congruous with the housewife's activity (comp. <a href="/exodus/5-14.htm">Exodus 5:14</a>, where the same word is used in the case of the enforced labour of the Israelites). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/31-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She rises</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;
