In biblical context, the "she" refers to the adulterous woman, representing temptation and moral downfall. The imagery of being "brought down to death" underscores the severe consequences of succumbing to sin, echoing the warnings found throughout Proverbs about the dangers of straying from wisdom and righteousness. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that sin leads to spiritual death, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, which states, "For the wages of sin is death." The phrase serves as a cautionary reminder of the ultimate cost of turning away from God's path.<p><b>her slain are many in number.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the widespread impact and prevalence of those who have fallen victim to temptation and sin. The term "slain" suggests a violent or sudden downfall, reinforcing the idea that the consequences of sin are not only severe but also inevitable. Historically, this reflects the cultural context of ancient Israel, where moral and spiritual integrity were paramount, and deviation from God's commandments often led to dire outcomes. The phrase can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of the narrow path to life versus the broad road to destruction, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>. It serves as a stark warning to remain vigilant and steadfast in faith, avoiding the pitfalls that have ensnared many before.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seductress.htm">The Seductress</a></b><br>This figure represents the personification of temptation and sin, often depicted as a wayward woman leading others astray.

The image paints seduction as a corridor leading straight to ruin.<p>&#8226; Proverbs often links immorality with physical destruction&#8212;&#8220;her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>). The end can be a jealous spouse&#8217;s vengeance, sexually transmitted disease, or even the Old Testament penalties for adultery (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the verse reaches deeper. Sin breeds spiritual death&#8212;separation from God (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). Sexual sin is singled out because it is &#8220;against his own body&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>), piercing both soul and flesh.<p>&#8226; The warning: what feels private and harmless is actually a descent. One step onto her path starts a decline that ends in death unless stopped by repentance (<a href="/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11-14</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>her slain are many in number</b><p>The danger is not rare; it&#8217;s epidemic.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Many&#8221; stresses volume&#8212;countless lives across history bear the scars. Solomon&#8217;s audience saw examples; so do we. Statistics on broken marriages, fatherless homes, and pornography addictions echo the proverb&#8217;s claim.<p>&#8226; Scripture records fallen heroes: Samson (<a href="/bsb/judges/16.htm">Judges 16</a>), David (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>), and Solomon himself (<a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3-4</a>). None were immune. Their downfall reinforces that seduction is indiscriminate&#8212;youthful, aged, strong, or wise.<p>&#8226; The plural &#8220;slain&#8221; underscores continual casualties. Every generation that ignores God&#8217;s boundaries replenishes the list (<a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; The point: we face a battlefield, not a playground. Just as soldiers avoid known minefields, believers must steer clear of compromising situations (<a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-15</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/7-26.htm">Proverbs 7:26</a> soberly states that sexual immorality is a lethal force with a staggering body count. The seductive voice promises pleasure but delivers physical, relational, and spiritual death. Because the casualties are &#8220;many,&#8221; vigilance and obedience to God&#8217;s moral boundaries are non-negotiable safeguards for every believer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For she hath east down many wounded.</span> Delitzsch, "For many are the slain whom she hath caused to fall."
