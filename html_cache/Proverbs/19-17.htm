The Old Testament law emphasized care for the poor, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>, which commands generosity towards them. The cultural context of ancient Israel was agrarian, and the poor often included widows, orphans, and foreigners who lacked land or resources. Jesus Christ exemplified kindness to the poor, as seen in His ministry and teachings, such as in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>, where He identifies Himself with the needy.<p><b>is a loan to the LORD</b><br>This phrase suggests that acts of kindness towards the poor are seen by God as a personal obligation He takes upon Himself. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, loans were a common practice, and the idea of lending to God elevates the act of charity to a divine transaction. This reflects the biblical principle that God values and rewards acts of mercy and compassion. The concept of God being indebted to repay kindness is unique and underscores His justice and faithfulness.<p><b>and He will repay the lender</b><br>The assurance of repayment by God highlights His faithfulness and the certainty of His promises. This repayment is not necessarily material but can be spiritual or eternal, aligning with the biblical theme of rewards in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The historical context of Israel included a strong belief in divine retribution and blessing, as seen in the covenantal promises of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. This phrase also connects to the New Testament teaching of sowing and reaping, as found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>, where believers are encouraged to do good, trusting in God's ultimate reward.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, the poor are those who are economically disadvantaged and in need of assistance. They are often highlighted in Scripture as individuals deserving of compassion and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is portrayed as the ultimate guarantor of justice and provider for those who act righteously.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lender.htm">The Lender</a></b><br>This refers to the person who shows kindness to the poor, effectively "lending" to the LORD through their charitable actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_perspective_on_generosity.htm">God's Perspective on Generosity</a></b><br>God views acts of kindness to the poor as personal loans to Himself, indicating His deep concern for the needy and His promise to reward those who help them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_divine_economy.htm">The Divine Economy</a></b><br>In God's economy, acts of charity are investments with guaranteed returns.

Scripture repeatedly ties genuine faith to compassionate action:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a> urges Israel not to &#8220;harden your heart&#8221; but to &#8220;open your hand&#8221; when you see a needy brother.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a> says, &#8220;Blessed is he who is kind to the needy,&#8221; showing that generosity ushers in God&#8217;s favor, not misfortune.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> reminds us that true worship is to &#8220;share your bread with the hungry,&#8221; while <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-17</a> warns that faith without meeting physical needs is dead.<p>&#8226; Jesus models this heart in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>, counting service to &#8220;the least of these&#8221; as service to Himself.<p>Kindness here is not merely sentiment; it is hands-on mercy&#8212;food, shelter, encouragement, advocacy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is a loan to the LORD</b><p>The proverb moves from the visible act to an invisible transaction: helping the poor is treated as lending to God Himself. That breathtaking thought appears elsewhere:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a> teaches, &#8220;Whoever oppresses the poor taunts his Maker, but he who honors Him has mercy on the needy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a> assures believers that &#8220;God is not unjust; He will not forget your work and the love you have shown Him as you have helped His people.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a> echoes, &#8220;Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.&#8221;<p>The Lord identifies so closely with the disadvantaged that our generosity to them registers in heaven&#8217;s ledger as if He borrowed from us. This also underscores His personal involvement: He observes, records, and counts every act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will repay the lender</b><p>God never defaults. &#8220;He will repay&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>b) carries the certainty of His character and covenant faithfulness:<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a> promises, &#8220;Give, and it will be given to you&#8230; For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-8</a> ties cheerful giving to abundant harvest&#8212;both in material provision and spiritual fruit.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a> invites Israel to test God&#8217;s faithfulness: &#8220;See if I will not open the windows of heaven.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> reminds us that He &#8220;rewards those who earnestly seek Him.&#8221;<p>The repayment may come as timely financial supply, unexpected opportunities, deeper joy, or eternal rewards (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). Whatever the form, His repayment is sure, generous, and often multiplies far beyond the initial gift.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a> stitches together three inseparable truths: when we extend practical kindness to the poor, we are in effect lending to the Lord, and He guarantees full repayment. Scripture affirms this pattern from Moses to Jesus to the apostles. Because God is faithful and His Word is literal and true, believers can give freely, confident that every act of mercy is noticed, valued, and rewarded by the One who owns &#8220;the cattle on a thousand hills&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Lendeth unto the Lord.--</span>Who "for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich" (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.">2Corinthians 8:9</a>), and Who regards all done to one of his poor brethren as done unto Himself (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm" title="And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me.">Matthew 25:40</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord.</span> English Church people are familiar with this distich, as being one of the sentences of Scripture read at the Offertory. The word for "poor" is here <span class="accented">dal</span>, "feeble" (see on vers. 1 and 4). It is a beautiful thought that by showing mercy and pity we are, as it were, making God our debtor; and the truth is wonderfully advanced by Christ, who pronounces (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>), "Inasmuch as ye have done it mite one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (see on Proverbs 11:24; 28:27). St. Chrysostom ('Hom.,' 15, on <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>), "To the more imperfect this is what we may say, Give of what you have unto the needy. Increase your substance. For, saith he, 'He that giveth unto the poor lendeth unto God.' But if you are in a hurry, and wait not for the time of retribution, think of those who lend money to men; for not even these desire to get their interest immediately; but they are anxious that the principal should remain a good long while in the hands of the borrower, provided only the repayment be secure, and they have no mistrust of the borrower. Let this be done, then, in the present case also. Leave them with God, that he may pay thee thy wages manifold. Seek not to have the whole here; for if you recover it all here, how will you receive it back there? And it is on this account that God stores them up there, inasmuch as this present life is full of decay. But he gives even here also; for, 'Seek ye,' saith he, 'the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.' Well, then, let us look towards that kingdom, and not be in a hurry for the repayment of the whole, lest we diminish our recompense. But let us wait for the fit season. For the interest in these cases is not of that kind, but is such as is meet to be given by God. This, then, having collected together in great abundance, so let us depart hence, that we may obtain beth the present and the future blessings" (Oxford transl.). <span class="cmt_word">That which he hath given will he pay him again;</span> <span class="accented">Vicissitudinem suam reddet ei</span>, Vulgate, "According to his gift will he recompense him." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">gemul</span>), "good deed" (<a href="/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>, where it is rendered "recompense"). Ecclus. 32(35):10, etc., "Give unto the Most High according as he hath enriched thee; and as thou hast gotten give with a cheerful eye. For the Lord recompenseth, and will give thee seven times as much." There are proverbs rife in other lands to the same effect. The Turk says, "What you give in charity in this world you take with you after death. Do good, and throw it into the sea if the fish does not know it, God does." And the Russian, "Throw bread and salt behind you, you get them before you" (Lane). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/19-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Kindness</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2603.htm">Strong's 2603: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bend, stoop in kindness to an inferior, to favor, bestow, to implore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the poor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1800.htm">Strong's 1800: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dangling, weak, thin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a loan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;w&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3867.htm">Strong's 3867: </a> </span><span class="str2">To twine, to unite, to remain, to borrow, to lend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1453;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and He will repay</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;al&#183;lem-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7999.htm">Strong's 7999: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be safe, to be, completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the lender].</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 19:17 He who has pity on the poor (Prov.
