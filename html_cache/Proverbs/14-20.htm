In biblical times, poverty was frequently seen as a sign of divine disfavor or personal failure, leading to social ostracism. The neighbor, who should be a source of support and community, instead becomes a source of disdain. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the fallen nature of humanity, where sin distorts relationships (Genesis 3). The Law of Moses, however, commands love and care for one's neighbor, including the poor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18, 19</a>:34), emphasizing God's heart for justice and mercy. Jesus Christ, in His ministry, often reached out to the marginalized, embodying the call to love one's neighbor as oneself (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>).<p><b>but many are those who love the rich</b><br>This part of the verse contrasts the treatment of the poor with that of the rich, who are often favored and admired. In ancient cultures, wealth was associated with power, influence, and divine blessing, leading to preferential treatment. This favoritism is critiqued throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/james/2.htm">James 2:1-9</a>, where believers are warned against showing partiality based on wealth. The love for the rich can be superficial, driven by self-interest and the desire for personal gain. Jesus warned against the deceitfulness of riches (<a href="/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>) and taught that true treasure is found in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The rich young ruler's encounter with Jesus (<a href="/mark/10-17.htm">Mark 10:17-22</a>) illustrates the spiritual danger of wealth when it becomes an idol. This verse challenges believers to examine their attitudes towards wealth and poverty, aligning their values with God's kingdom, where the last shall be first (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_man.htm">The Poor Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who lack material wealth and resources.

Scripture describes what often happens in a fallen world, alerting us so we will not follow the same pattern (cf. <a href="/proverbs/29-7.htm">Proverbs 29:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Poverty alone becomes a reason people distance themselves. In <a href="/proverbs/19-7.htm">Proverbs 19:7</a>, we read, &#8220;All the brothers of a poor man hate him; how much more do his friends abandon him!&#8221; The repetition underscores how quickly bonds can dissolve when there is nothing material to gain.<p>&#8226; Jesus highlights this same dynamic in <a href="/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20-21</a>, where Lazarus, a destitute beggar, is ignored by those who could help.
