The accumulation of wealth could lead to increased social status and influence, drawing many people who sought to benefit from the wealthy individual's resources. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/proverbs/14-20.htm">Proverbs 14:20</a>, which notes the social dynamics surrounding wealth and poverty. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on hospitality and generosity, which were easier to practice with abundant resources. Wealth could also be seen as a means of securing alliances and friendships, as seen in the relationships between kings and nations in the Old Testament.<p><b>but a poor man is deserted by his friend</b><br>Poverty in biblical times often led to social isolation and vulnerability. Without resources, a person could not reciprocate favors or provide for others, leading to abandonment by those who were once considered friends. This reflects the harsh realities of a society where survival often depended on mutual support and exchange. The plight of the poor is a recurring theme in Scripture, with God frequently commanding His people to care for the needy and marginalized (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). The contrast between the wealthy and the poor in this proverb highlights the transient nature of human relationships based on material gain. It also foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the value of spiritual wealth over material possessions and called His followers to love and serve the poor (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, <a href="/luke/6-20.htm">Luke 6:20-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
