In ancient Israelite architecture, roofs were flat and often used as additional living space. The "corner of the roof" implies a small, exposed area, vulnerable to the elements. This imagery highlights the severity of the situation being described. The Bible often uses the roof as a place of solitude or prayer, as seen in <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>, where Peter goes to the rooftop to pray. The emphasis here is on the preference for solitude over conflict, suggesting that peace of mind is more valuable than physical comfort.<p><b>than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife</b><br>The "quarrelsome wife" is a recurring theme in Proverbs, symbolizing discord and strife within the household. <a href="/proverbs/19-13.htm">Proverbs 19:13 and 27</a>:15 also mention the contentious wife, indicating the disruptive nature of constant conflict. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the household was the center of life and community. A harmonious home was seen as a blessing, while a contentious one was a source of distress. The verse underscores the importance of a peaceful home environment, which is echoed in the New Testament's emphasis on love and mutual respect within marriage, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>. The comparison suggests that spiritual and emotional well-being should take precedence over material or social considerations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

This, though exposed to the inclemency of the weather, would be not an uncomfortable situation during a great part of the year. But the proverb implies a position abnormally inconvenient as an alternative preferable to a residence inside. Hence, perhaps, it is advisable to render, with Delitzsch, "Better to sit on the pinhole of a house roof." Septuagint, "It is better to dwell in a corner of a place open to the sky (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Than with a brawling</span> (<span class="accented">contentious</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>woman in a</span> <span class="cmt_word">wide</span> <span class="cmt_word">house;</span> literally, <span class="accented">a house of society</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a house in common (comp. ver. 19 and <a href="/proverbs/25-24.htm">Proverbs 25:24</a>). A solitary corner, replete with inconveniences, is to be preferred to house shared with woman, wife or other female relation, of a quarrelsome and vexatious temper. The LXX. puts the matter forcibly, "than in cieled rooms with unrighteousness and in a common house." So the Latin proverb, "Non quam late, sed quam laete habites, refert." The Scotch have a proverb to the same effect: "A house wi' a reek and a wife wi' a reerd (scold) will sune mak' a man run to the door." "I had rather dwell," says the Son of Sirach (Ecclus. 25:16), "with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/21-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Better</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to live</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#353;e&#183;&#7687;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a corner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(pin&#183;na&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6438.htm">Strong's 6438: </a> </span><span class="str2">An angle, a pinnacle, a chieftain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the roof</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1490;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#257;&#7713;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1406.htm">Strong's 1406: </a> </span><span class="str2">A roof, the top of an altar</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than to share</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1469;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7687;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2267.htm">Strong's 2267: </a> </span><span class="str2">Company, association, spell</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with a quarrelsome</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1437;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7695;&#183;y&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4079.htm">Strong's 4079: </a> </span><span class="str2">Brawling, contention </span><br /><br /><span class="word">wife.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/21-9.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 21:9 It is better to dwell (Prov.
