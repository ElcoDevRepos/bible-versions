The "forbidden woman" refers to an adulteress or a woman who leads others into sexual immorality. In the historical context of ancient Israel, such relationships were strictly prohibited by Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). The term "forbidden" implies a boundary set by God, and crossing it leads to spiritual and often physical consequences. The imagery of rescue suggests that wisdom acts as a safeguard against the temptations that lead to sin. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where wisdom is portrayed as a divine gift that guides believers away from paths of destruction (<a href="/proverbs/4-6.htm">Proverbs 4:6-7</a>).<p><b>from the stranger with seductive words</b><br>The "stranger" here can be understood as someone outside the covenant community of Israel, often representing foreign influences that lead people away from God. In the cultural context, seductive words are a metaphor for deceit and manipulation, which are tools used by those who seek to lead others astray. This phrase warns against the allure of smooth and enticing speech that can mask dangerous intentions. The Bible frequently warns against being swayed by eloquent but misleading words (<a href="/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>). The seductive nature of such words is contrasted with the truth and clarity of God's wisdom, which provides discernment and protection. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to test everything and hold on to what is good (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_forbidden_woman.htm">The Forbidden Woman</a></b><br>This figure represents temptation and moral danger, often symbolizing adultery or unfaithfulness.

The &#8220;it&#8221; refers back to the twin guardians of &#8220;wisdom&#8221; and &#8220;discretion&#8221; that enter the heart when we diligently seek the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Wisdom does not merely inform; it intervenes&#8212;pulling us back from danger much like Joseph&#8217;s fleeing from Potiphar&#8217;s wife (<a href="/genesis/39-7.htm">Genesis 39:7-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The rescue is literal: God&#8217;s truth keeps a believer from crossing moral lines that carry devastating consequences (<a href="/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9-11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; This protection comes beforehand&#8212;before compromise feels irresistible (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>), guarding both mind and body.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the forbidden woman</b><p>The phrase pictures the adulteress, literally &#8220;the woman who belongs to another.&#8221;<p>&#8226; She is &#8220;forbidden&#8221; because God&#8217;s law clearly prohibits adultery (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Wisdom exposes her allure as counterfeit: &#8220;the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey, but in the end she is bitter as wormwood&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By showing the high cost&#8212;broken marriages, damaged witness, divine discipline (<a href="/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27-29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>)&#8212;wisdom makes sin appear as ugly as it truly is.<p>&#8226; The text assumes men are tempted, yet the warning applies to anyone facing illicit sexual invitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the stranger with seductive words</b><p>Here the focus shifts to her speech&#8212;promises of excitement, secrecy, fulfillment.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Stranger&#8221; highlights that she stands outside God-ordained covenant bonds (<a href="/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Seductive talk flatters the ego, dulls discernment, and reframes sin as pleasure (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Wisdom equips believers to detect and reject such manipulation, whether it comes through an actual person, entertainment, or online enticement (<a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical outworkings:<p>&#8211; Keep God&#8217;s word continually before your eyes (<a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20-23</a>).<p>&#8211; Guard associations that stir desire toward sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p>&#8211; Invite accountable relationships that speak truth when temptation whispers lies (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a> promises real deliverance. When God&#8217;s wisdom fills the heart, it actively rescues us&#8212;from crossing the line with someone else&#8217;s spouse and from every smooth-talking voice that invites immorality. Scripture&#8217;s counsel is not abstract; it is a gracious shield preserving purity, marriages, and testimony for Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">To deliver thee from the strange woman.--</span>Another work of wisdom, to save from profligacy. Of the two epithets here used, <span class= "ital">"</span>strange" (<span class= "ital">z?rah</span>) and "stranger" (<span class= "ital">nokhriyyah</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the first implies that she belonged to another family, the second to another nation. It would seem as if the evil example of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm" title="But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:">1Kings 11:1</a>), in marrying foreign women, had become common in Israel, and that they, by their vicious lives, had become a deadly source of corruption. Brought up in the lax views of morality which prevailed among heathen nations at this time, they would not consider themselves bound by the high standard of purity which was enjoined upon Hebrew women by the Law.<p>(16-19) Besides the literal sense of this passage, as given above, commentators have very generally found in it a spiritual meaning, a warning against idolatry and apostasy. The union of Israel to God is so frequently spoken of in the prophets under the figure of a marriage, and their rejection of Him for idols as adultery, that the passage may well bear this further sense, especially as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/3-4.htm" title="Will you not from this time cry to me, My father, you are the guide of my youth?">Jeremiah 3:4</a>) has borrowed this very phrase, "guide of her youth," for a passage in which he is reproving the Jews for their faithlessness. The figure is also very common in the New Testament, as descriptive of the union of Christ and the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To deliver thee from the strange woman.</span> This is the second form of temptation against which <span class="accented">wisdom</span> (discretion) is a preservative, and the great and especial dangers arising from it to youth, owing to its seductive allurements, afford the reason why the teacher is so strong in his warnings on this subject. Two terms are employed to designate the source of this evil - "the strange woman" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">ishshah zara</span>), and "the stranger" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">nok'riyah</span>) - and both undoubtedly, in the passage before us, mean a meretricious person, one who indulges in illicit intercourse. The former term is invariably employed in this sense in the Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2, 20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-14.htm">Proverbs 22:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-33.htm">Proverbs 23:33</a>) of the adulteress (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">zarim</span>), and <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a>.
