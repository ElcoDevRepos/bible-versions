In ancient Israel, the Law of Moses included numerous provisions for the care of the poor, such as leaving gleanings in the fields (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>) and the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25). The cultural context of the time placed a strong emphasis on community and mutual support, reflecting God's heart for justice and mercy. Ignoring the plight of the poor was seen as a violation of God's commands and a failure to reflect His character. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about caring for "the least of these" (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<p><b>he too shall cry out and receive no answer</b><br>This part of the verse warns of divine retribution for those who ignore the needy. The principle of sowing and reaping is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The idea is that God will treat individuals as they have treated others, a concept also found in the parable of the unmerciful servant (<a href="/matthew/18-23.htm">Matthew 18:23-35</a>). The historical context suggests that in times of distress, such as famine or invasion, those who had previously ignored the cries of the poor would find themselves in similar situations, crying out for help but receiving none. This reflects the justice of God, who is attentive to the cries of the oppressed and expects His people to act likewise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>This refers to individuals who are in need or lack resources. In the biblical context, the poor are often seen as those who are vulnerable and require assistance from others.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_shuts_his_ears.htm">The One Who Shuts His Ears</a></b><br>This person represents individuals who ignore or refuse to help those in need. The act of shutting one's ears symbolizes a deliberate choice to be indifferent to the plight of others.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cry.htm">The Cry</a></b><br>This is the plea or call for help from those who are suffering or in need. It is a call for compassion and assistance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequence.htm">The Consequence</a></b><br>The event described is the reciprocal justice that occurs when the one who ignored the poor finds themselves in need and receives no help.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_compassion.htm">The Call to Compassion</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to be compassionate and responsive to the needs of the poor.

Crying out is natural in crisis, and God is eager to respond&#8212;yet the verse warns of a condition attached.<p>&#8226; Prophets echo the same warning: &#8220;Then they will cry to the LORD, but He will not answer them&#8221; (<a href="/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>). Divine justice ensures that the measure we use is measured back to us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and receive no answer</b><p>The sobering finale&#8212;&#8220;and receive no answer&#8221;&#8212;declares that indifference toward others&#8217; pleas blocks heaven&#8217;s ears to our own.<p>&#8226; Isaiah delivered the same verdict: &#8220;When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide My eyes from you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Wisdom literature repeats it: &#8220;Then they will call on me, but I will not answer&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>) and &#8220;He who turns away his ear from listening to the law, even his prayer is detestable&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Zechariah records God saying, &#8220;They refused to pay attention &#8230; Therefore, just as I called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; James sums it up: &#8220;Judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>).<p>The principle is crystal clear: refusing mercy forfeits mercy. The literal promise of unanswered prayer is not hyperbole; it is a reliable warning rooted in God&#8217;s unchanging character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/21-13.htm">Proverbs 21:13</a> draws a straight line between our response to human need and God&#8217;s response to us. If we plug our ears to the poor, we will find heaven silent when we are the ones crying out. Loving action toward the needy is therefore not optional charity but essential obedience. God&#8217;s Word assures that those who honor Him by open-handed compassion will, in their own hour of need, experience His attentive care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">He also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</span>--Because he showed no mercy.
