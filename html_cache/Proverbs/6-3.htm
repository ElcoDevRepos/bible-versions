The term "my son" reflects the paternal tone of Proverbs, emphasizing wisdom as a familial inheritance. The call to "free yourself" suggests a situation of entrapment or obligation, likely due to a rash commitment or pledge. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of seeking freedom from sin and folly, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>, which speaks of Christ setting believers free.<p><b>for you have fallen into your neighbor&#8217;s hands</b><br>The imagery of falling into a neighbor's hands indicates a loss of control or autonomy, often due to financial or social obligations. In ancient Israel, such situations could arise from pledging security for another's debt, a common practice that could lead to servitude if not resolved. This reflects the cultural and historical context where community and neighborly relations were vital, yet could also become sources of entrapment, as seen in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>), which highlights the complexities of neighborly duties.<p><b>Go, humble yourself</b><br>The directive to "humble yourself" underscores the importance of humility in resolving conflicts and obligations. Humility is a recurring biblical virtue, essential for reconciliation and restoration, as seen in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, which promises that God will lift up those who humble themselves. This act of humility is not just a personal virtue but a strategic move to restore relationships and honor.<p><b>and press your plea with your neighbor</b><br>This phrase emphasizes proactive engagement and negotiation. The act of pressing one's plea involves earnest communication and persistence, reflecting the biblical principle of seeking peace and resolution, as encouraged in <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>, where reconciliation is prioritized before worship. The cultural context of ancient Israel valued direct communication and resolution of disputes, often conducted at city gates or public forums, highlighting the communal aspect of justice and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_son.htm">My Son</a></b><br>This phrase is often used in Proverbs to address the reader or listener, symbolizing a fatherly or mentor-like guidance.

By calling him &#8220;my son,&#8221; he signals personal responsibility and affection, not mere advice. The phrase also reminds us that wisdom is meant to be heeded within relationship; ignoring it is a personal affront to the one who loves us (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The same fatherly tone appears in <a href="/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1&#8211;2</a>, where obedience opens the door to peace and long life.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this relational appeal when He says, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to free yourself</b><p>The goal is deliverance&#8212;real, tangible escape from a trap we have sprung on ourselves by rashly guaranteeing another&#8217;s debt (see <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1&#8211;2</a>; 11:15).

The surety is to take immediate steps to be set free. The urgency of the advice is to be explained by the serious consequences which would follow in the event of the debtor not satisfying the creditor in due time. The surety became liable to the penalties inflicted by the Hebrew law of debt. His property could be distrained. His bed and his garment could be taken from him (<a href="/proverbs/22-27.htm">Proverbs 22:27</a> and Proverbs 20:16), and he was liable as well as his family to be reduced to the condition of servitude. So we find the son of Sirach saying, "Suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations" (Ecclus. 29:18; cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3-5</a>; and <a href="/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a>). Compare the dictum of Thales, the Greek philosopher, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "Give surety, and ruin is near;" and that of Chilo (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 6:32), "Sponsioni non deest jactura" - "Loss is not wanting to a surety." The same idea is conveyed in the modern German proverb, "Burgen soll man wurgen" - "Worry a surety" <span class="cmt_word">Do this now;</span> or, <span class="accented">therefore.</span> The particle <span class="accented">epho</span> is intensive, and emphasizes the command, and in this sense is of frequent occurrence (<a href="/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>; <a href="/genesis/27-32.htm">Genesis 27:32</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-10.htm">2 Kings 10:10</a>, etc.). It appears to be equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">quod dico.</span> So the Vulgate, "Do therefore what I say;" similarly the LXX. renders, "Do, my son, what I bid thee (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." It carries with it the sense of instant and prompt action. <span class="cmt_word">And deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> set thyself free when thou findest thou art actually at the mercy of thy friend for whom thou hast become surety. The <span class="accented">ki</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is not hypothetical, but actual; it is not "if" you are, but "when" or because you actually are in his power. The Vulgate and LXX. render <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> respectively by <span class="accented">quia</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Go, humble thyself;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> present thyself as a suppliant, prostrate thyself, offer thyself to be trodden upon (Michaelis), or humble thyself like to the threshold which is trampled and trode upon (Rashi). or humble thyself under the soles of his feet (Aben Ezra). The expression implies the spirit of entire submission, in which the surety is to approach his friend in order to be released from his responsibility. The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">hith'rappes</span> has, however, been rendered differently. Radically <span class="accented">raphas</span> signifies "to tread or trample with the feet," and this has been taken to express haste, or the bestirring of one's self. So the Vulgate reads <span class="accented">festina</span>, "hasten;" and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be not remiss." But the hithp, clearly determines in favour of the reflexive rendering; comp. <a href="/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>, "Till every one submit himself with pieces of silver" - the only other passage where <span class="accented">raphas</span> occurs. <span class="cmt_word">And make sure thy friend</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">r'hav reeyka</span>); rather, <span class="accented">importune thy friend</span>, be urgent with him, press upon him to fulfil his engagement. The verb <span class="accented">rahav</span> is properly "to be fierce," "to rage," and hence with the accusative, as here, "to assail with impetuosity." In <a href="/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a> it is used with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">b</span>), and signifies to act fiercely against any one. The meaning of the passage is that if abject submission or persuasion does not avail, then sterner measures are to be resorted to to gain the desired end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1508;&#1450;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;
